Last time we posted fourth quarter and full year results for 2015. For the fourth quarter, CF Industries generated EBITDA of $254 million and full year EBITDA of $1.7 billion. After taking into account hedging loss",856,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Last time we posted fourth quarter and full year results for 2015. For the fourth quarter, CF Industries generated EBITDA of $254 million and full year EBITDA of $1.7 billion. After taking into account hedging losses, an impairment loss on our Trinidad joint venture equity investment, costs related to both the CF strategic venture and the OCI transaction and expenses related to the project, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $2 billion.
Despite difficult market conditions, we generated gross margin of over 25% of the fourth quarter and over 35% for the year. If not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of roughly $100 million of natural gas hedges, our gross margin for the fourth quarter would've been approximately 34%. And if not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of approximately $175 million, our gross margin for the full year was roughly 40%.
Our quarterly and full year results continue to demonstrate the cash-generating capability of this company. We consistently deliver solid results because of our cost advantage position within the industry, despite the fact that the global fertilizer market is oversupplied. 
In several production regions of the world, currency devaluations and other factors have reduced costs for high-cost producers, some of which have continued to run despite negative margins, leading to excess the supply. As a result, there has been downward pressure on prices. Urea transactions have been reported at price levels not seen in a decade. However, even against this backdrop, we still delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion. 
Our business is not like other commodities. It shares little to nothing with iron, steel, copper or coal. A country or region with a slowing economy may stop building skyscrapers, ships and highways, but it's people still need to eat. Global nitrogen demand remains strong and growing. To be sure there is excess supply, that we occupy the lowest cost position in the industry and continue to generate significant cash.
All commodities are not created equal, and it is critically important to keep our perspective on the underlying fundamentals of our business as distinct from others.
First, several weeks ago, there were reports of urea trading in the U.S. Gulf at or below $200 per short ton [ph]. While some business was done at this level, the volume was extremely thin because these prices were well below the replacement cost for the marginal producers. As we suspected all along, available volume was scarce and just 2 weeks later, urea is now reported trading in the range of $250 per ton [ph], up more than 25% from the beginning of February.
Second, we have seen a decrease in both Chinese exports and urea plant operating rates. The most recent industry publications for the Chinese fertilizer market indicate that operating rates for coal-based urea producers have declined 66 [ph] -- to 66% in January from 73% in December. While that may not sound like a large amount, the 7-point drop in Chinese operating rates equates to a reduction of approximately 6 million tons of urea on an annual basis. These facts are just to us the previously published prices are not sustainable. 
Third, even at the $200 per ton price trough published in January, a typical U.S. Gulf producer of urea generates roughly 50% cash margins. This is driven by low-cost North American natural gas, providing us the sustainable advantage versus producers in other regions, further bolstered by the import-dependent nature of North America.
While it should be obvious that the sky is not falling, that nitrogen is not like other commodities and that our business remains highly attractive and continues to generate significant cash. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives, we have made significant progress and are now in full delivery mode. Since our last earnings call, we amended our announced business combination with OCI's European, North American and global trading distribution businesses to incorporate in and become a tax resident of the Netherlands. We expect to close this transaction in the middle of 2016. 
We commenced our strategic venture with CHS, receiving a $2.8 billion payment and have begun shipping product in our supply agreement. 
We have also entered the final stages of our capacity expansion projects. The Donaldsonville urea plant has been in production since November of last year. The plant is mechanically complete and in the process of being commissioned, and we expect the welding and piping work on the ammonia plant, which represents the majority of the remaining work and cost, to be completed within the next 8 weeks. 
We also expect Port Neal to be mechanically complete in the second quarter of 2016, meaning all of our spending on this projects will very soon be behind us. The total costs for both projects remains in line with our previous estimates, and similarly our projected returns for the projects have not changed. 
I will now turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, and then I'll wrap up with some perspectives on strategy in the longer-term outlook. Bert?"

The global nitrogen market continues to be supplied driven with increased availability of internationally sourced product pressuring prices. During the fourth quarter prices for all fertilizer products declined including nitrogen. Excess supply around the world and new capacity coming online all helped to push the market lower. Urea prices declined throughout the quarter, decreasing from a high of $260 per short ton FOB at the beginning of the quarter to $220 per short ton FOB NOLA at the end of the quarter. As Tony said, very little business were done at these lower levels as the market was highly illiquid. During the fourth quarter, the Chinese government allowed the yuan to devalue further, continuing trend that began in the third quarter 2015. 
On accounting for the devaluation, along with the decrease in coal prices and continued weakness in ocean freight, cash cost of urea production for the marginal Chinese anthracite coal-based producer are now estimated to be near the seasonal low of roughly $225 per short ton delivered to the U.S. Gulf. As Tony mentioned, production rates in China are declining, and some high-cost producers have already curtailed production or shut down altogether. 
Exports out of China were 1.5 million tons lower in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, exports totaled approximately 13.8 million tons, which is slightly higher than the full year 2014. 
In the U.S., industrial ammonia demand was impacted by lower phosphate production and the fourth quarter agricultural ammonia application season was negatively impacted by weather. Warm weather into early November, coupled with a combination of rain and snow later that month, limited most of the Midwest from getting applications completed. In addition, customers were reluctant to buy urea in much of the fourth quarter due to the prospect of lower prices in the future. 
So weather-related disruption of the fourth quarter ammonia application season, along with the late purchases of UAN and urea during the fourth quarter should lead to a larger than average spring demand and a corresponding rebound in prices as nitrogen fertilizer must be applied on an annual basis.
Ahead of spring, the company's well-positioned with inventory prepared to serve key markets. Nitrogen fertilizer demand in North America is expected to remain steady in 2016 compared to 2015. Current projected returns for the 2016 crop, based on new crop futures, continue to favor corn planting over soybeans. As a result, 2016 corn planting is expected to reach approximately 90.5 million acres, which is a 2.5 million acre increase from 2015. 
North American natural gas continues to provide the company a substantial cost advantage compared to other global producers. The North American natural gas market began the fourth quarter of 2015 with minimal price movement and lower volatility. However, that quickly turned into a sharp downward shift in prices in the latter half of October. Stronger than expected El Niño conditions brought warmer weather that continued through much of the quarter and was a large contributor to the significant decrease in gas demand. Natural gas consumption North America for residential and commercial uses during the fourth quarter of 2015 was 16% lower in the fourth quarter of -- end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Despite the continued decrease in rig count, gas production continued at record levels during the fourth quarter and the storage balance in North America reached a record level of 4 trillion cubic feet at the end of the injection season. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the fourth quarter we generated $254 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were approximately a $98 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our natural gas hedges, a $62 million loss for an impairment of our PLNL joint venture equity investment, $20 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture, $15 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, and a $3 million loss on our foreign currency hedges. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76. 
For the year we generated $1.7 billion in EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $2.96. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $3.88. Our realized natural gas cost for the quarter was $3.07 per MMBtu and consisted of purchased natural gas of $2.66 per MMBtu and a realized loss of $0.41 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our natural gas cost has declined by 25% when compared to fourth quarter of 2014.  For the full year 2015, our realized natural gas cost was also $3.07 per MMBtu, a 28% reduction compared to 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. 
The company completed a review of its equity method investments and Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited, PLNL, our 50% investment in an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. This review assessed the recoverability of the company's carrying value of the investment. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million relating to its investment in PLNL due to continuing gas curtailments from the government-controlled gas supplier and the expectation is that these curtailments will continue. 
On December 18, 2015, the protecting Americans from tax hikes, [indiscernible], was signed into law and applies to tax years' 2015 through 2019. One of the provisions of that ad permits companies to deduct 50% of their capital expenditures for federal income tax purposes in the year qualifying assets are placed into service. As a result of this provision, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company recorded a federal tax receivable of approximately $120 million that is expected to result in a tax refund. This receivable is primarily associated with new urea plants and related offsites that were placed into service at the companies at Donaldsonville and Louisiana complex during November of 2015.
In 2016, the company expects to place into service the new UAN and ammonia plants at Donaldsonville and a new urea and ammonia plant at Port Neal. Most of these assets will also qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service in 2016, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.
For the full year of 2015, our total capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion. This consists of approximately $1.7 billion for the capacity expansion projects plus approximately $600 million of sustaining improvement and other capital expenditures and $155 million of capitalized interest. 
For 2016, the company expects to have capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be for capacity expansion projects and $600 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move onto Q&A, I wanted to review our near and longer-term outlook and the significant benefits of our strategic initiatives. 
As we have already discussed, our business continues its strong operating performance, delivering $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Looking at the fundamentals, cash margins for North American producers are in the 50% to 60% range even with today's market conditions. Against this healthy backdrop, over the next roughly 6 months, we are about to grow significantly, adding 60% new production capacity to our portfolio with very similar margin structures to our current business. 
We are investment-grade and have a very strong balance sheet, having just received $2.8 billion in cash. Our spending on the capacity expansion projects is quickly coming to an end as we expect to be fully mechanically complete within the second quarter. Our business combination with OCI is expected to deliver roughly $500 million annually in after-tax, full run rate benefits. And we expect our longer-term effective tax rate to drop from 35% into the low 20s, making us that much more efficient at converting EBITDA into cash.
Finally, bonus depreciation will provide a significant cash flow benefit this year. 
The bright future we've been talking about is arriving now. This is a lot of very positive change all being delivered in a short period of time. However, one thing is constant through it all, and that is our focused strategy for driving total shareholder returns. Our goal is to grow cash generation per share and our capital allocation philosophy flows from that. We first look to grow our cash generation, the numerator in the equation. We do that with investments that have risk-adjusted rates of return well above our cost of capital and only if they drive cash flow per share accretion. Otherwise, we look to reduce our outstanding share count, thereby reducing the denominator of the equation. 
Consistent with our past actions, all excess cash will be returned to shareholders. While we are fully committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit rating, as we look forward we believe there will be significant cash available for deployment. We will do that consistent with our singular goal of growing cash generation per share just like we have in the past. 
I want to end today's call by thanking all of our employees who have worked so hard, not only on all of our strategic initiatives, but also keeping the core CF business running so strongly on a daily basis while delivering our best ever safety performance, a truly remarkable accomplishment. Many of the steps we have taken are already showing results, and I am excited that the next 6 months should see all of our initiatives move from planning and development into actually delivering cash flow to the bottom line. 
With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Operator."

Very few margins were traded at those lower levels and we know that because we entered the market to buy a few and they were not there. I do anticipate we are seeing now probably the opportunity for an early Spring. Applications have already begun in the Southwest Texas and Oklahoma. And the temperature this weekend are very conducive to continue that activity. And I think you see that's alarming trend move through drying trend throughout the Midwest. I would think that within the month in the upper Midwest that being Nebraska, Iowa, we may even seek applications beginning then. You are correct that a lot of the ammonia stays within the producers hands and is available to the customers, those being the retailers who sell to the farmers their application. And I think the order trend has been a little bit different than in previous years, but the feedback we're getting from our customers is that there will be a significant demand. We lost a lot of ammonia applications in the fall just due to the weather issues we articulated. And so do that end will still needed to be applied. And so as you move that to Spring, we'll need to record ammonia season in order to fill some of that nitrogen demand, which I think will be difficult. And so for your comment on UAN, we believe that's going to fall, either to urea or both urea and UAN. And we're positioning our products and our terminals with our customers for that eventuality. We're seeing a pretty healthy market going forward for nitrogen on the demand side and a parallel positive position for pricing going into and through spring and even on the back half."

Today, the domestic price is better and the incentive then is for the Chinese producer, the urea producer to keep that product moving to the interior and then they'll probably look to the export market as we move through spring. Today, if you loaded a Chinese vessel, let's say March 1st, and we're sending that to the United States to New Orleans, there would probably be a 45-day voyage and discharge arriving in mid- to late April.

On urea, I think there is sufficient inventory to begin the season. You can look at the import numbers and then again at the production numbers and our production numbers.

This is Dennis. In this slide talking about this in the deck. What we've done here is basically what we look at basically all of the cost that exist at the plant site, plus all of the cost, and includes the cost to ship the coal to it, the plants that incurred, the cost at the plant site that are incurred and the cost to ship that product to the port and then, obviously, to load it on the port so that it can be loaded in both ships to the U.S. Gulf. So all of that input from the coal mine all the way through the product arriving at the U.S. Gulf are included here. And what we do is on a regular basis, we're going to update that for everything from Chinese exchange rates to Chinese coal costs, in addition to that freight rate. And we do this across the curve. And so what's happened if you look at sort of where we come to is as you've seen a decline in coal prices but you've also seen a decline in the R&D exchange rate and we've also seen a decline in shipping rates. And so that's what accounts for sort of the shift downward and what we call the seasonal floor price range. And I want to be clear that this is a seasonal floor price range because we're seeing its $2.25 [ph] to $2.70 [ph]. But we do perhaps differently from the way other producers look at it is we look at the fluctuations and monthly offtake for urea. And so during low periods, you'll see lower prices like we've seen here in January and February. And then during high periods like when you get into the spring, it takes more dollars to bid the more expensive marginal producers into the market. But that's basically how we do this. We look at each of the buyers here in the cost curve and we will update that. With respect to China, we've got a lot of insight because studies that we've done on a plant by plant basis, and so we will update the cost on a plant-by-plant basis for the various subsets of their producers."

So I think with this release for pricing on corn, you're probably going to see -- you could see maybe a lower level of planting. But again, it's at a pretty high price today with that subsidy. And -- but they also have a fairly low yield. So several things are changing in China. The move to acquire Syngenta, which we believe were the seed technology and germplasm associated with that, and the change possibly to GMO products in China I think we have an evolving situation coupled with a change in the economy, this currency devaluation.

I think when we're talking about a stronger, second half of the fertilizer year as opposed to a stronger half of the second half of the calendar year, because what happens was with the low level of application of ammonia in the fall are relatively lighter application, we still see total nitrogen aggregate demand in North America being roughly equivalent to where it was last year. So corn acres are off a bit. Wheat acres are down a bit. Overall, the same amount of nitrogen. But with less going down in the fall, that means more has got to go down in the spring with the same kind of yield. So that's why we're pretty bullish here on the spring application season. I think everyone says the second half of the year, once you get past July 1, that's a complete reset and you start all over again. I don't know that we're taking a strong position on that one. Relative to Europe, yes, we are completely unhedged, both on the U.K. production as well as anything on the continent. And our view historically has been that we hedged in order to take out price volatility, typically associated with weather-related events. And recently here, as we got into last year, we took some longer positions in North America. Obviously those positions are upside down. And as we have kind of stepped back and evaluated our thinking on this, I think you'll see us head more towards our traditional approach, which is hedging is not to try to lock in any particular cost base over a long period of time, but it's really to take out these volatility and possibly get rid of some basis risk."

New capacity will continue to be added until the next marginal plant only reaches its kind of cost of capital return. And that's the price at which we say kind of long-term mid-cycle prices. Even though feedstock costs have declined, as you've said, one of the things that's helpful in that equation is the fact that capital cost continues to increase. And the lowest-cost gas region right now in terms of that new facility is North America. And if you look at what the cost to bring new production on in North America, it is very high as we know all too well. And the results of that is, we have not seen a dramatic shift in our long-term view of where pricing has to be in order to support a healthy marketplace. It's moving a little bit, but not dramatically. And it's really, the vast majority of cost is on the ammonia making step from a viable cost perspective. And so we believe that you continue to have sort of traditional increases in relative values. The more upgrade you do, because you've got to pay for new capital even though there's not very much variable cost there, you have to pay for the new capital to put in each new step in the upgrade process, and the functionality of UAN stock is greater than urea and whatnot. So each step in the process has to return an appropriate capital and also farm gets more utility out of UAN that they pay a premium for. So we don't see that there being a radical change in terms of the underlying margin or pricing structure between products. And in fact, over the long-term, we don't see a radical change in terms of where we expect product pricing to trend."

And it's -- it means there's less money going to NGC, National Gas Company. It's in a situation where at the price it's currently being paid for the gas that's below what we believe replacement cost of gas in Trinidad is. And so one of the things that is different today than maybe a year or 2 ago is we believe that curtailments may have been more temporary in the past than the new production coming online. As we sit here today, gas price doesn't justify the new investment needed to bring on additional production and at the lower product price  in the marketplace. You can't make out for the loss production that we're losing. So it's that combination of factors that's really led us to take the impairment."

For the fourth quarter, CF Industries generated EBITDA of $254 million and full year EBITDA of $1.7 billion. After taking into account hedging losses and impairment loss on our Trinidad joint venture equity investment, costs related to both the CHS strategic venture and the OCI transaction and expenses related to the expansion projects, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $2 billion.
Despite difficult market conditions, we generated gross margin of over 25% for the fourth quarter and over 35% for the year. If not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of roughly $100 million on natural gas hedges, our gross margin for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 34%. And if not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of approximately $175 million, our gross margin for the full year was roughly 40%.
Our quarterly and full year results continued to demonstrate the cash-generating capability of this company. We consistently deliver solid results because of our cost advantage position within the industry, despite the fact that the global fertilizer market is oversupplied. 
In several production regions of the world, currency devaluations and other factors have reduced costs for high-cost producers, some of which have continued to run despite negative margins, leading to excess supply. As a result, there has been downward pressure on prices. Urea transactions have been reported at price levels not seen in a decade. However, even against this backdrop, we still delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion. 
Our business is not like other commodities. It shares little to nothing with iron, steel, copper or coal. A country or region with a slowing economy may stop building skyscrapers, ships and highways, but its people still need to eat. Global nitrogen demand remains strong and growing. To be sure, there is excess supply, but we occupy the lowest cost position in the industry and continue to generate significant cash.  All commodities are not created equal, and it is critically important to keep a perspective on the underlying fundamentals of our business as distinct from others.
First, several weeks ago, there were reports of urea trading in the U.S. Gulf at or below $200 per short ton. While some business was done at this level, the volume was extremely thin because these prices were well below the replacement cost for the marginal producers. As we suspected all along, available volume was scarce, and just 2 weeks later, urea is now reported trading in the range of $250 per ton, up more than 25% from the beginning of February.
Second, we have seen a decrease in both Chinese exports and urea plant operating rates. The most recent industry publications for the Chinese fertilizer market indicate that operating rates for coal-based urea producers have declined 66 -- to 66% in January from 73% in December. While that may not sound like a large amount, the 7-point drop in Chinese operating rates equates to a reduction of approximately 6 million tons of urea on an annual basis. These facts suggest to us that previously published prices are not sustainable. 
Third, even at the $200 per ton price trough published in January, a typical U.S. Gulf producer of urea generates roughly 50% cash margins. This is driven by low-cost North American natural gas, providing us the sustainable advantage versus producers in other regions, further bolstered by the import-dependent nature of North America.  So it should be obvious that the sky is not falling, that nitrogen is not like other commodities, and that our business remains highly attractive and continues to generate significant cash. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives, we have made significant progress and are now in full delivery mode. Since our last earnings call, we amended our announced business combination with OCI's European, North American and global trading distribution businesses to incorporate in and become a tax resident of the Netherlands. We expect to close this transaction in the middle of 2016. 
We commenced our strategic venture with CHS, receiving a $2.8 billion payment, and have begun shipping product under the supply agreement.  We have also entered the final stages of our capacity expansion projects. The Donaldsonville urea plant has been in production since November of last year. The UAN plant is mechanically complete and in the process of being commissioned, and we expect the welding and piping work on the ammonia plant, which represents the majority of the remaining work and cost, to be completed within the next 8 weeks.  We also expect Port Neal to be mechanically complete in the second quarter of 2016, meaning all of our spending on these projects will very soon be behind us. The total cost for both projects remains in line with our previous estimates, and similarly, our projected returns for the projects have not changed. 
I will now turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, and then I'll wrap up with some perspectives on strategy in the longer-term outlook. Bert?"

The global nitrogen market continues to be supply-driven with increased availability of internationally sourced product pressuring prices. During the fourth quarter prices for all fertilizer products declined, including nitrogen. Excess supply around the world and new capacity coming online all helped to push the market lower. Urea prices declined throughout the quarter, decreasing from a high of $260 per short ton fob NOLA at the beginning of the quarter to $220 per short ton fob NOLA at the end of the quarter. As Tony said, very little business was done at these lower levels as the market was highly illiquid. 
During the fourth quarter, the Chinese government allowed the yuan to devalue further, continuing the trend that began in the third quarter of 2015.  On accounting for the devaluation, along with the decrease in coal prices and continued weakness in ocean freight, cash cost of urea production for the marginal Chinese anthracite coal-based producer are now estimated to be near the seasonal low of roughly $225 per short ton delivered to the U.S. Gulf. As Tony mentioned, production rates in China are declining, and some high-cost producers have already curtailed production or shut down altogether. 
Exports out of China were 1.5 million tons lower in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, exports totaled approximately 13.8 million tons, which is slightly higher than the full year 2014. 
In the U.S., industrial ammonia demand was impacted by lower phosphate production and the fourth quarter agricultural ammonia application season was negatively impacted by weather. Warm weather into early November, coupled with the combination of rain and snow later that month, limited most of the Midwest from getting applications completed. In addition, customers were reluctant to buy urea and UAN during much of the fourth quarter due to the prospect of lower prices in the future.  The weather-related disruption of the fourth quarter ammonia application season, along with the late purchases of UAN and urea during the fourth quarter should lead to a larger-than-average spring demand and a corresponding rebound in prices as nitrogen fertilizer must be applied on an annual basis.  Ahead of spring, the company's well-positioned, with inventory prepared to serve key markets. 
Nitrogen fertilizer demand in North America is expected to remain steady in 2016 compared to 2015. Current projected returns for the 2016 crop, based on new crop futures, continue to favor corn planting over soybeans. As a result, 2016 corn planting is expected to reach approximately 90.5 million acres, which is a 2.5 million acre increase from 2015. 
North American natural gas continues to provide the company a substantial cost advantage compared to other global producers. The North American natural gas market began the fourth quarter of 2015 with minimal price movement and lower volatility. However, that quickly turned into a sharp downward shift in prices in the latter half of October. Stronger-than-expected El Niño conditions brought warmer weather that continued through much of the quarter and was a large contributor to the significant decrease in gas demand. Natural gas consumption in North America for residential and commercial uses during the fourth quarter of 2015 was 16% lower in the fourth quarter of -- end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Despite the continued decrease in rig count, gas production continued at record levels during the fourth quarter and the storage balance in North America reached a record level of 4 trillion cubic feet at the end of the injection season. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dennis."

Included in these results were approximately a $98 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our natural gas hedges, a $62 million loss for an impairment of our PLNL joint venture equity investment, $20 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture, $15 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, and a $3 million loss on our foreign currency hedges. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76. 
For the year, we generated $1.7 billion EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $2.96. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $3.88. Our realized natural gas cost for the quarter was $3.07 per MMBtu and consist of purchased natural gas of $2.66 per MMBtu and a realized loss of $0.41 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our natural gas cost has declined by 25% when compared to fourth quarter of 2014.  For the full year 2015, our realized natural gas cost was also $3.07 per MMBtu, a 28% reduction compared to 2014. 
During the fourth quarter, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. 
The company completed a review of its equity method investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited, PLNL, our 50% investment in an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. This review assessed the recoverability of the company's carrying value of the investment. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million relating to its investment in PLNL due to continuing gas curtailments from the government-controlled gas supplier, and the expectation is that these curtailments will continue. 
On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes, PATH, Act was signed into law and applies to tax years 2015 through 2019. One of the provisions of the act permits companies to deduct 50% of their capital expenditures for federal income tax purposes in the year qualifying assets are placed into service. As a result of this provision, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company recorded a federal tax receivable of approximately $120 million that is expected to result in a tax refund. This receivable is primarily associated with new urea plants and related offsites that were placed into service at the company's Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex during November of 2015.
In 2016, the company expects to place into service the new UAN and ammonia plants at Donaldsonville and a new urea and ammonia plants at Port Neal. Most of these assets will also qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service in 2016, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.
For the full year 2015, our total capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion. This consists of approximately $1.7 billion for the capacity expansion projects plus approximately $600 million of sustaining improvement and other capital expenditures and $155 million of capitalized interest. 
For 2016, the company expects to have capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, of which, $1.2 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $600 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move onto Q&A, I wanted to review our near and longer-term outlook and the significant benefits of our strategic initiatives. 
As we have already discussed, our business continues its strong operating performance, delivering $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Looking at the fundamentals, cash margins for North American producers are in the 50% to 60% range even with today's market conditions. Against this healthy backdrop, over the next roughly 6 months, we are about to grow significantly, adding 60% new production capacity to our portfolio with very similar margin structures to our current business. 
We are investment-grade and have a very strong balance sheet, having just received $2.8 billion in cash. Our spending on the capacity expansion projects is quickly coming to an end as we expect to be fully mechanically complete within the second quarter. Our business combination with OCI is expected to deliver roughly $500 million annually in after-tax, full run rate benefits. And we expect our longer-term effective tax rate to drop from 35% into the low 20s, making us that much more efficient at converting EBITDA into cash.
Finally, bonus depreciation will provide a significant cash flow benefit this year. 
The bright future we've been talking about is arriving now. This is a lot of very positive change all being delivered in a short period of time. However, one thing is constant through it all, and that is our focused strategy for driving total shareholder returns. Our goal is to grow cash generation per share and our capital allocation philosophy flows from that. We first look to grow our cash generation, the numerator in the equation. We do that with investments that have risk-adjusted rates of return well above our cost of capital and only if they drive cash flow per share accretion. Otherwise, we look to reduce our outstanding share count, thereby reducing the denominator in the equation.  
Consistent with our past actions, all excess cash will be returned to shareholders. While we are fully committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit rating, as we look forward we believe there will be significant cash available for deployment. We will do that consistent with our singular goal of growing cash generation per share, just like we have in the past. 
I want to end today's call by thanking all of our employees who have worked so hard, not only on all of our strategic initiatives, but also keeping the core CF business running so strongly on a daily basis while delivering our best-ever safety performance, a truly remarkable accomplishment. Many of the steps we have taken are already showing results, and I am excited that the next 6 months should see all of our initiatives move from planning and development into actually delivering cash flow to the bottom line. 
With that, we will now open the lines to answer your questions. Operator."

Probably it's more of a normal price range than the, I think we had an anomaly, like you said. Very few barges were traded at those lower levels, and we know that because we entered the market to buy a few, and they were not there. I do anticipate we are seeing now probably the opportunity for an early spring. Applications have already begun in the Southwest Texas, Oklahoma. And the temperatures this weekend are very conducive to continue that activity. And I think, as you see that warming trend move through drying trend throughout the Midwest, I would think that within a month, in the upper Midwest, that being Nebraska, Iowa, we may even see applications beginning then. You're correct that a lot of the ammonia stays within the producers' hands and is available to the customers, those being the retailers which then sell to the farmers for application, and I think the order trend has been a little bit different than in previous years. But the feedback we're getting from our customers is that there will be significant demand. We lost a lot of ammonia applications in the fall just due to the weather issues we articulated. And so that end will still be needed to be applied. And so as you move that to Spring, we're going to need almost a record ammonia season in order to fill some of that nitrogen demand, which I think will be difficult. And so for your comment on UAN, we believe that's going to fall, either to urea or both urea and UAN. And we're positioning our products and our terminals with our customers for that eventuality, that we're seeing a pretty healthy market going forward for nitrogen on the demand side and a parallel positive position for pricing going into and through spring and even on the back half."

As what we said in the comments with -- we believe that the Chinese producers, a majority of them, had been operating at or below cost. There's very little incentive then to push product to the ports. And so we're seeing the Chinese industry operate rationally and according to economic principles. Eventually, gravity does work even in China. And so when you look at today, what's going on in China, wheat topdress has begun in China. And you're seeing product move into those markets. Today, the domestic price is better and the incentive then is for the Chinese producer, the urea producer, to keep that product moving to the interior. And then they'll probably look to the export market as we move through spring. Today, if you loaded a Chinese vessel, let's say March 1, and we're sending that to the United States to New Orleans, there would probably be a 45-day voyage and then discharge arriving in mid to late April. And you're starting to get a little bit late. There have been some Chinese vessels sold for this spring, and we think they'll arrive in late March through early April. But once you get past April, it's difficult to have that product be applied for the spring and post planting season."

Most of the ammonia's sitting with us or the other producers in the terminal system throughout the Midwest. And so what we know, just based on imports and production levels of UAN, we expect that those levels are lower than historical, due to the fact that we trended into fertilizer year 2016 at a low level of inventory entering that season, and then the production and imports, together with that, to build our number. On urea, I think there's sufficient inventory to begin the season. You can look at the import numbers, and then again, at the production numbers and our production numbers. So there is enough probably in position, but is in the right position and then the second round of product that needs to be available. And I think that's why you've seen this rally. It's the scramble to get product in position."

I'm just trying to [indiscernible] the slide that you're talking about here in the deck. What we've done here is, basically, what we look at is, basically, all of the cost that exist at the plant site plus all the cost -- and includes cost to ship the coal to it, the plants that incurred -- the costs at the plant site that are incurred and the cost to ship that product to the port. And then, obviously, to load it on the port so that it can be loaded in the boat and shipped to the U.S. Gulf. A lot of those inputs, sort of from the coal mine all the way through to the product arriving at the U.S. Gulf, are included here. And what we do is, on a regular basis, we're going to update that for everything from Chinese exchange rates to Chinese coal costs. In addition to that, to freight rate. And we do this across the curve. And so what's happened, if you look at sort of where we've come to, is you've seen a decline in coal prices, but you've also seen a decline in the RMB exchange rate and we've also seen a decline in shipping rates. And so that's what accounts for sort of the shift downward and what we call the seasonal floor price range. And I want to be clear that this is a seasonal floor price range, because we're saying its $225 to $270. And what we do, perhaps differently from the way other producers look at it, is we look at the fluctuations and monthly offtake for urea. And so during low periods, you'll see lower prices like we've seen here in January and February. And then during high periods, like when you get into the spring, it takes more dollars to bid the more expensive marginal producers into the market. But that's basically how we do this. We look at each of the buyers here in the cost curve and we will update that. With respect to China, we've got a lot of insight because of studies that we've done on a plant-by-plant basis, and so we will update the cost on a plant-by-plant basis for the various subsets of their producers."

However, that's also compared, contrasted against what the market is offering and the view that we think the market's going to improve. So the incentive to have a forward order book in January and December just wasn't there, and we have the capability to hold that product in inventory or change the production mix or export product.

To be a 12-month, 365-day producer of these products, you need to be able to move things out, and at times, move them out in large quantities. So that's when we look to the export markets. We are active today in France, in Belgium, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil on UAN. We've opened up Colombia recently. And so when we're focused on products, today, it's predominantly a UAN play.

As China has outsourced their soybean production to Brazil, Argentina in the United States, and has continued to grow, and with that, grow their end demand for corn and wheat -- and the stockpiles of corn aren't high. That has created some perverse incentives. And so you see a store of them in DDGs and things -- and those substitute products coming into the greater level into China. So I think with this release on pricing on corn, you're probably going to see -- you could see maybe a lower level of planting. But again, it's at a pretty high price today with that subsidy. And -- but they also have a fairly low yield. So several things are changing in China. The move to acquire Syngenta, which we believe, with the seed technology and the germplasm associated with that, and the change possibly to GMO products in China, I think we have an evolving situation, coupled with the change in the economy, this currency devaluation. All these things together, I think, it's a little early to predict what that result will be to nitrogen.

But I think when we're talking about a stronger, second half of the fertilizer year, as opposed to a stronger half of -- the second half of the calendar year. Because what happened was with the low level of application of ammonia in the fall, a relatively lighter application, we still see total nitrogen aggregate demand in North America being roughly equivalent to where it was last year. So corn acres are off a bit. Wheat acres, we think, are down a bit. Overall, kind of the same amount of nitrogen. But with less going down in the fall, that means more has got to go down in the spring in order to get the same kind of yield. So that's why we're pretty bullish here on the spring application season. I think everyone says the second half of the year, once you get past July 1, that's a complete reset and you start all over again."

New capacity will continue to be added until the next marginal plant only reaches its kind of cost of capital return. And that's the price at which we say it's kind of long-term mid-cycle prices. What -- even though feedstock costs have declined, as you've said, one of the things that's helpful in that equation is the fact that capital cost continues to increase. And the lowest-cost gas region right now, in terms of adding new facilities, is North America. And if you look at what the cost to bring new production on in North America, it is very high, as we know all too well. And the results of that is, we have not seen a dramatic shift in our long-term view of where pricing has to be in order to support a healthy marketplace. It's moved a little bit, but not dramatically. And it's really, the vast majority of the cost is on the ammonia making step from a variable cost perspective. And so we believe that you'll continue to have to have sort of traditional increases in relative values the more upgrade you do because you've got to pay for new capital. Even though there's not very much variable cost there, you have to pay for the new capital to put in each new step in the upgrade process. And the functionality of UAN, as Bert was talking about earlier, is greater than urea or UAN and whatnot. So each step in the process has to return appropriate capital, and also, the farmer gets more utility out of UAN, so they pay a premium for it. So we don't see that there being a radical change in terms of the underlying margin or pricing structure between products. And in fact, over the long-term, we don't see a radical change in terms of where we expect product pricing to trend."

So from a cost curve perspective, although there will be additions in between and substractions, puts and takes, at the far right-hand side of the cost curve remains Chinese producers, and at the far left-hand side of the cost curve, we believe, maintains North American production, which is where we sit.

So in our case, for our -- our one plant joint venture, it's indexed off of ammonia pricing. Some of them are off of methanol price, some of them are off of ammonia price and so forth. And so what happens is as product pricing has come down, that means the gas priced into the Point Lisas that stayed has also correspondingly come down. And it means there's less money going to NGC, National Gas Company.  It's in a situation where at the price that's currently being paid for the gas that's below what we believe replacement cost of gas in Trinidad is. And so one of the things that is different today than maybe 1 year or 2 ago was we believe that curtailments may have been more temporary in the past than the new production was coming online. As we sit here today, gas price doesn't justify the new investment needed to bring on additional production and at the lower product price  in the marketplace, you can't make out for the loss production that we're losing. So it's that combination of factors that's really led us to take the impairment."

For the fourth quarter, CF Industries generated EBITDA of $254 million and full year EBITDA of $1.7 billion. After taking into account hedging losses, an impairment loss on our Trinidad joint venture equity investment, costs related to both the CHS strategic venture and the OCI transaction and expenses related to the expansion projects, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $2 billion.
Despite difficult market conditions, we generated gross margin of over 25% for the fourth quarter and over 35% for the year. If not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of roughly $100 million on natural gas hedges, our gross margin for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 34%. And if not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of approximately $175 million, our gross margin for the full year was roughly 40%. 
Our quarterly and full year results continued to demonstrate the cash-generating capability of this company. We consistently deliver solid results because of our cost advantaged position within the industry, despite the fact that the global fertilizer market is oversupplied.  In several production regions of the world, currency devaluations and other factors have reduced costs for high-cost producers, some of which have continued to run despite negative margins, leading to excess supply. As a result, there has been downward pressure on prices. Urea transactions have been reported at price levels not seen in a decade. However, even against this backdrop, we still delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion. 
Our business is not like other commodities. It shares little to nothing with iron, steel, copper or coal. A country or region with a slowing economy may stop building skyscrapers, ships and highways, but its people still need to eat. Global nitrogen demand remains strong and growing. To be sure, there is excess supply, but we occupy the lowest cost position in the industry and continue to generate significant cash.  All commodities are not created equal, and it is critically important to keep a perspective on the underlying fundamentals of our business as distinct from others.
First, several weeks ago, there were reports of urea trading in the U.S. Gulf at or below $200 per short ton. While some business was done at this level, volume was extremely thin because these prices were well below the replacement cost for the marginal producers. As we suspected all along, available volume was scarce, and just 2 weeks later, urea is now reported trading in the range of $250 per ton, up more than 25% from the beginning of February.
Second, we have seen a decrease in both Chinese exports and urea plant operating rates. The most recent industry publications for the Chinese fertilizer market indicate that operating rates for coal-based urea producers have declined 66 -- to 66% in January from 73% in December. While that may not sound like a large amount, the 7-point drop in Chinese operating rates equates to a reduction of approximately 6 million tons of urea on an annual basis. These facts suggest to us that previously published prices are not sustainable. 
Third, even at the $200 per ton price trough published in January, a typical U.S. Gulf producer of urea generates roughly 50% cash margins. This is driven by low-cost North American natural gas, providing us the sustainable advantage versus producers in other regions, further bolstered by the import-dependent nature of North America.  So it should be obvious that the sky is not falling, that nitrogen is not like other commodities, and that our business remains highly attractive and continues to generate significant cash. 
Turning to our strategic initiatives, we have made significant progress and are now in full delivery mode. Since our last earnings call, we amended our announced business combination with OCI's European, North American and global trading distribution businesses to incorporate in and become a tax resident of the Netherlands. We expect to close this transaction in the middle of 2016. 
We commenced our strategic venture with CHS, receiving a $2.8 billion payment, and have begun shipping product under the supply agreement.  We have also entered the final stages of our capacity expansion projects. The Donaldsonville urea plant has been in production since November of last year. The UAN plant is mechanically complete and in the process of being commissioned, and we expect the welding and piping work on the ammonia plant, which represents the majority of the remaining work and cost, to be completed within the next 8 weeks.  We also expect Port Neal to be mechanically complete in the second quarter of 2016, meaning all of our spending on these projects will very soon be behind us. The total cost for both projects remains in line with our previous estimates, and similarly, our projected returns for the projects have not changed. 
I will now turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, and then I'll wrap up with some perspectives on strategy in the longer-term outlook. Bert?"

The global nitrogen market continues to be supply-driven with increased availability of internationally sourced product pressuring prices. During the fourth quarter prices for all fertilizer products declined, including nitrogen. Excess supply around the world and new capacity coming online all helped to push the market lower. Urea prices declined throughout the quarter, decreasing from a high of $260 per short ton fob NOLA at the beginning of the quarter to $220 per short ton fob NOLA at the end of the quarter. As Tony said, very little business was done at these low levels as the market was highly illiquid. 
During the fourth quarter, the Chinese government allowed the yuan to devalue further, continuing the trend that began in the third quarter of 2015.  On accounting for the devaluation, along with the decrease in coal prices and continued weakness in ocean freight, cash cost of urea production for the marginal Chinese anthracite coal-based producer are now estimated to be near the seasonal low of roughly $225 per short ton delivered to the U.S. Gulf. As Tony mentioned, production rates in China are declining, and some high-cost producers have already curtailed production or shut down altogether.  Exports out of China were 1.5 million tons lower in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, exports totaled approximately 13.8 million tons, which is slightly higher than the full year 2014. 
In the U.S., industrial ammonia demand was impacted by lower phosphate production and the fourth quarter agricultural ammonia application season was negatively impacted by weather. Warm weather into early November, coupled with the combination of rain and snow later that month, limited most of the Midwest from getting applications completed. In addition, customers were reluctant to buy urea and UAN during much of the fourth quarter due to the prospect of lower prices in the future.  The weather-related disruption of the fourth quarter ammonia application season, along with delayed purchases of UAN and urea during the fourth quarter should lead to a larger-than-average spring demand and a corresponding rebound in prices as nitrogen fertilizer must be applied on an annual basis.  Ahead of spring, the company's well-positioned, with inventory prepared to serve key markets. 
Nitrogen fertilizer demand in North America is expected to remain steady in 2016 compared to 2015. Current projected returns for the 2016 crop, based on new crop futures, continue to favor corn planting over soybeans. As a result, 2016 corn planting is expected to reach approximately 90.5 million acres, which is a 2.5 million acre increase from 2015. 
North American natural gas continues to provide the company a substantial cost advantage compared to other global producers. The North American natural gas market began the fourth quarter of 2015 with minimal price movement and lower volatility. However, that quickly turned into a sharp downward shift in prices in the latter half of October. Stronger-than-expected El Niño conditions brought warmer weather that continued through much of the quarter and was a large contributor to the significant decrease in gas demand. Natural gas consumption in North America for residential and commercial uses during the fourth quarter of 2015 was 16% lower in the fourth quarter of -- end of fourth quarter of 2014. Despite the continued decrease in rig count, gas production continued at record levels during the fourth quarter and the storage balance in North America reached a record level of 4 trillion cubic feet at the end of the injection season. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the fourth quarter, we generated $254 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were approximately a $98 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our natural gas hedges, a $62 million loss for an impairment of our PLNL joint venture equity investment, $20 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture, $15 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, and a $3 million loss on our foreign currency hedges. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76. 
For the year, we generated $1.7 billion EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $2.96. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $3.88. Our realized natural gas cost for the quarter was $3.07 per MMBtu and consist of purchased natural gas of $2.66 per MMBtu and a realized loss of $0.41 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our natural gas cost has declined by 25% when compared to fourth quarter of 2014.  For the full year 2015, our realized natural gas cost was also $3.07 per MMBtu, a 28% reduction compared to 2014. During the fourth quarter, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. 
The company completed a review of its equity method investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited, PLNL, our 50% investment in an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. This review assessed the recoverability of the company's carrying value of the investment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million relating to its investment in PLNL due to continuing gas curtailments from the government-controlled gas supplier, and the expectation is that these curtailments will continue. 
On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes, PATH Act was signed into law and applies to tax years 2015 through 2019. One of the provisions of the act permits companies to deduct 50% of their capital expenditures for federal income tax purposes in the year qualifying assets are placed into service. As a result of this provision, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company recorded a federal tax receivable of approximately $120 million that is expected to result in a tax refund. This receivable is primarily associated with new urea plants and related off sites that were placed into service at the company's Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex during November of 2015.
In 2016, the company expects to place into service the new UAN and ammonia plants at Donaldsonville and a new urea and ammonia plants at Port Neal. Most of these assets will also qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service in 2016, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.
For the full year 2015, our total capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion. This consists of approximately $1.7 billion for the capacity expansion projects plus approximately $600 million of sustaining improvement and other capital expenditures and $155 million of capitalized interest. For 2016, the company expects to have capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $600 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects.

Before we move onto Q&A, I wanted to review our near and longer-term outlook and the significant benefits of our strategic initiatives. 
As we have already discussed, our business continues its strong operating performance, delivering $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Looking at the fundamentals, cash margins for North American producers are in the 50% to 60% range even with today's market conditions. Against this healthy backdrop, over the next roughly 6 months, we are about to grow significantly, adding 60% new production capacity to our portfolio with very similar margin structures to our current business. 
We are investment-grade and have a very strong balance sheet, having just received $2.8 billion in cash. Our spending on the capacity expansion projects is quickly coming to an end as we expect to be fully mechanically complete within the second quarter. Our business combination with OCI is expected to deliver roughly $500 million annually in after-tax, full run rate benefits. And we expect our longer-term effective tax rate to drop from 35% into the low 20s, making us that much more efficient at converting EBITDA into cash. Finally, bonus depreciation will provide a significant cash flow benefit to this year. 
The bright future we've been talking about is arriving now. This is a lot of very positive change all being delivered in a short period of time. However, one thing is constant through it all, and that is our focused strategy for driving total shareholder returns. Our goal is to grow cash generation per share and our capital allocation philosophy flows from that. We first look to grow our cash generation, the numerator in the equation. We do that with investments that have risk-adjusted rates of return well above our cost of capital and only if they drive cash flow per share accretion. Otherwise, we look to reduce our outstanding share count, thereby reducing the denominator in the equation.  
Consistent with our past actions, all excess cash will be returned to shareholders. While we are fully committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit rating, as we look forward we believe there will be significant cash available for deployment. We will do that consistent with our singular goal of growing cash generation per share, just like we have in the past. 
I want to end today's call by thanking all of our employees who have worked so hard, not only on all of our strategic initiatives, but also keeping the core CF business running so strongly on a daily basis while delivering our best-ever safety performance, a truly remarkable accomplishment. Many of the steps we have taken are already showing results, and I am excited that the next 6 months should see all of our initiatives move from planning and development into actually delivering cash flow to the bottom line.

Very few barges were traded at those lower levels, and we know that because we entered the market to buy a few, and they were not there. I do anticipate we are seeing now probably the opportunity for an early spring. Applications have already begun in the Southwest Texas, Oklahoma. And the temperatures this weekend are very conducive to continue that activity. And I think, as you see that warming trend move through drying trend throughout the Midwest, I would think that within a month, in the upper Midwest, that being Nebraska, Iowa, we may even see applications beginning then. You're correct that a lot of the ammonia stays within the producers' hands and is available to the customers, those being the retailers which then they'll sell to the farmers for application, and I think the order trend has been a little bit different than in previous years. But the feedback we're getting from our customers is that there will be significant demand. We lost a lot of ammonia applications in the fall just due to the weather issues we articulated. And so that end will still be needed to be applied. And so as you move that to spring, we're going to need almost a record ammonia season in order to fill some of that nitrogen demand, which I think will be difficult. And so for your comment on UAN, we believe that's going to fall, either to urea or both urea and UAN. And we're positioning our products and our terminals with our customers for that eventuality, that we're seeing a pretty healthy market going forward for nitrogen on the demand side and a parallel positive position for pricing going into and through spring and even on the back half."

As what we said in the comments with -- we believe that the Chinese producers, a majority of them, had been operating at or below cost. There's very little incentive then to push product to the ports. And so we're seeing the Chinese industry operate rationally and according to economic principles. So eventually, gravity does work even in China. And so when you look at today, what's going on in China, wheat top dress has begun in China. And you're seeing product move into those markets. Today, the domestic price is better and the incentive then is for the Chinese producer, the urea producer, to keep that product moving to the interior. And then they'll probably look to the export market as we move through spring. Today, if you loaded a Chinese vessel, let's say March 1, and we're sending that to the United States to New Orleans. That would probably be a 45-day voyage and then discharge arriving in mid to late April. And you're starting to get a little bit late. There have been some Chinese vessels sold for this spring, and we think they'll arrive in late March through early April. But once you get past April, it's difficult to have that product be applied for the spring and post planting season."

It is a little bit anecdotal, but we do spend a lot of time trying to determine what the physical inventory position is, whether that be dry on urea or UAN in the tanks. Most of the ammonia's sitting with us or the other producers in the terminal system throughout the Midwest. And so what we know, just based on imports and production levels of UAN, we expect that those levels are lower than historical, due to the fact that we trended into fertilizer year 2016 at a low level of inventory entering that season, and then the production and imports, together with that, to build our number. On urea, I think there's sufficient inventory to begin the season. You can look at the import numbers, and then again, at the production numbers and our production numbers. So there is enough probably in position, but is in the right position and then the second round of product that needs to be available. And I think that's why you've seen this rally is the scramble to get product in position."

I'm just trying to [indiscernible] the slide that you're talking about here in the deck. What we've done here is, basically, what we look at is, basically, all of the cost that exist at the plant site plus all the cost -- and includes cost to ship the coal to it, the plants that incurred -- the costs at the plant site that are incurred and the cost to ship that product to the port. And then, obviously, to load it on the port so that it can be loaded on the boat and shipped to the U.S. Gulf. So all of those inputs, sort of from the coal mine all the way through to the product arriving at the U.S. Gulf, are included here. And what we do is, on a regular basis, we're going to update that for everything from Chinese exchange rates to Chinese coal costs. In addition to that, to freight rate. And we do this across the curve. And so what's happened, if you look at sort of where we've come to, is you've seen a decline in coal prices, but you've also seen a decline in the RMB exchange rate and we've also seen a decline in shipping rates. And so that's what accounts for sort of the shift downward and what we call the seasonal floor price range. And I want to be clear that this is a seasonal floor price range, because we're saying it's $225 to $270. And what we do, perhaps differently from the way other producers look at it, is we look at the fluctuations and monthly offtake for urea. And so during low periods, you'll see lower prices like we've seen here in January and February. And then during high periods, like when you get into the spring, it takes more dollars to bid the more expensive marginal producers into the market. But that's basically how we do this. We look at each of the bars here in the cost curve and we will update that. With respect to China, we've got a lot of insight because of studies that we've done on a plant-by-plant basis, and so we will update the cost on a plant-by-plant basis for the various subsets of their producers."

And when I say asset, that's the whole base, production, logistics, terminals, pipelines, to serve the American, or North American farmer. And so we want to be active participants in this market and monetize our position here. And then the next step is looking at the export market, because we're adding this new capacity. To be a 12-month, 365-day producer of these products, you need to be able to move things out, and at times, move them out in large quantities. So that's when we look to the export markets. We are active today in France, in Belgium, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil on UAN. We've opened up Colombia recently. And so when we're focused on products, today, it's predominantly a UAN play. And then next step, we've had some ammonia exports. We work with various people in that market, as well as destination consumers. But urea is coming. As we bring up -- we brought up the new plant and as we move to the spring, we believe it will be active more in the world urea market. And so I think you'll just see our export participation continue to grow and to be an integral part of our business."

As China has outsourced their soybean production to Brazil, Argentina and the United States, and has continued to grow, and with that, grow their end demand for corn and wheat -- and the stockpiles of corn aren't high. That has created some perverse incentives. And so you see a store of them in DDGs and things -- and those substitute products coming into the greater level into China. So I think with this release on pricing on corn, you're probably going to see -- you could see maybe a lower level of planting. But again, it's at a pretty high price today with that subsidy. And -- but they also have a fairly low yield. So several things are changing in China. The move to acquire Syngenta, which we believe, with the seed technology and the germplasm associated with that, and the change possibly to GMO products in China, I think we have an evolving situation, coupled with the change in the economy, this currency devaluation. All these things together, I think, it's a little early to predict what that result will be to nitrogen. But we see each of these steps as positive opening steps and greater participation in the global market, which sustains the price of corn, soybeans and wheat going forward."

But I think when we're talking about a stronger second half of the fertilizer year, as opposed to a stronger half of -- the second half of the calendar year. Because what happened was with the low level of application of ammonia in the fall, a relatively lighter application, we still see total nitrogen aggregate demand in North America being roughly equivalent to where it was last year. So corn acres are off a bit. Wheat acres, we think, are down a bit. Overall, kind of the same amount of nitrogen. But with less going down in the fall, that means more has got to go down in the spring in order to get the same kind of yield. So that's why we're pretty bullish here on the spring application season. I think everyone says the second half of the year, once you get past July 1, that's a complete reset and you start all over again. I don't know that we're taking a strong position on that one. Relative to Europe, yes, we are completely unhedged, both on the U.K. production, as well as anything on the continent. And our view historically has been that we hedge in order to take out price volatility typically associated with weather-related events. And recently here, as we got into last year, we took some longer positions in North America. Obviously those positions are upside down. And as we have kind of stepped back and evaluated our thinking on this, I think you'll see us head more towards our traditional approach, which is the hedging is really not to try to lock in any particular cost base over a long period of time, but it's really to take out the small volatility and possibly get rid of some basis risk."

New capacity will continue to be added until the next marginal plant only reaches its kind of cost of capital return. And that's the price at which we say kind of long-term mid-cycle price is. What -- even though feedstock costs have declined, as you've said, one of the things that's helpful in that equation is the fact that capital cost continues to increase. And the lowest-cost gas region right now, in terms of adding new facilities, is North America. And if you look at what the cost to bring new production on in North America, it is very high, as we know all too well. And the results of that is, we have not seen a dramatic shift in our long-term view of where pricing has to be in order to support a healthy marketplace. It's moved a little bit, but not dramatically. And it's really, the vast majority of the cost is in the ammonia making step from a variable cost perspective. And so we believe that you'll continue to have to have sort of traditional increases in relative values the more upgrade you do because you've got to pay for new capital. Even though there's not very much variable cost there, you have to pay for the new capital to put in each new step in the upgrade process. And the functionality of UAN, as Bert was talking about earlier, is greater than urea or UAN and whatnot. So each step in the process has to return appropriate capital, and also, farmer gets more utility out of UAN, so they pay a premium for it. So we don't see that there being a radical change in terms of the underlying margin or pricing structure between products. And in fact, over the long term, we don't see a radical change in terms of where we expect product pricing to trend."

When we look at the cost curve and dial ahead 2018, 2019, Chinese anthracite coal production remains the marginal producer. So from a cost curve perspective, although there will be additions in between and subtractions, puts and takes, at the far right-hand side of the cost curve remains Chinese producers, and at the far left-hand side of the cost curve, we believe, maintains North American production, which is where we sit.

So in our case, for our one plant joint venture, it's indexed off of ammonia pricing. Some of them are off of methanol price, some of them are off of ammonia price and so forth. And so what happens is as product pricing has come down, that means the gas priced into the Point Lisas estate has also correspondingly come down. And it means there's less money going to NGC, National Gas Company.  It's in a situation where at the price that's currently being paid for the gas that's below what we believe replacement cost of gas in Trinidad is. And so one of the things that is different today than maybe 1 year or 2 ago was we believe that curtailments may have been more temporary in the past and that new production was coming online. As we sit here today, gas price doesn't justify the new investment needed to bring on additional production and at the lower product price in the marketplace, you can't make out for the loss production that we're losing.

Last night, we posted CF Industries 2016 first quarter results in which we generated an EBITDA of $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million after taking into account net foreign currency losses, mark-to-mark",757,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted CF Industries 2016 first quarter results in which we generated an EBITDA of $207 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million after taking into account net foreign currency losses, mark-to-market hedge losses, transaction costs related to CHS and OCI and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects. 
The difficult market conditions in North America from late last year persisted into the early part of this year. However, as demand developed with the onset of spring, prices quickly moved up into the range we believe represents sustainable prices for the industry. 
Although industry publications reported January and February year repricing in NOLA well below $200, our realized price for the quarter was $256 a ton. 
Our reported gross margin was $217 million or 22% of approximately $1 billion of net sales. What I want to focus on is the strength and the underlying fundamentals of our business. To really understand those fundamentals, it is necessary to strip away the noise and short-term timing issues and look at just the core business. Excluding the impact of our natural gas hedges, consolidated gross margin would have been $294 million or around 30%. The unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss was $21 million and the realized natural gas derivative loss was $56 million for a full impact of $77 million associated with natural gas hedges. 
Over time, as the hedge position roles off, that noise will disappear and the core business will shine through. 
As we talked about in our last call and as shown on Slide 12 of our materials, even at our urea price of $200 per ton, a typical U.S. Gulf producer generates roughly 50% cash margins on each incremental ton and into this attractive environment that we are bringing on our new capacity additions. 
Our newly reappointed Donaldsonville is placed into service last November and is reliably operating 10% to 15% above nameplate capacity. Our new Donaldsonville in and UAN in plants where placed into service in March and are reliably operating 15% to 20% above nameplate capacity and we haven't even pushed them to the limit yet. 
We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant, and I'm in the process of recommissioning and commissioning activities. So the burn rate spend there has wound back considerably. And we expect to be fully completed Port Neal by the end of the second quarter, meaning our spending on the new projects will largely be wrapped up in the next 2 months. 
Finally, during the first quarter, our strategic venture with the CHS commenced. We received $2.8 billion in cash and began selling urea and UAN to them at market prices. 
On a global basis, capacity additions, along with lower feedstock cost and cheaper ocean freight, have led to a widening and flattening of the global cost curve over the last year. However, due to sustained annual growth in nitrogen demand, even with all of the additional capacity, during periods with more robust demand, higher cost tons must be bid into the market. We believe the Chinese anthracite coal-based facilities will continue to be the marginal cost producers for the foreseeable future, setting the global cost forward. 
In fact, Burt and I recently spent a week in China and met with about 10 different industry participants at their plans, the ports and their offices to gain additional insights into the evolving dynamics in China. 
Over the course of several days and over 1,000 miles travel, we came away with a few key themes: one, there are broad-based expectations that the nitrogen fertilizer industry will continue to rationalize, closing high cost inefficient plants. It is estimated that between 50% and 60% of the installed industry capacity in China is still side based coproductions and these facilities, along with certain gas plans, are the ones most at risk. 
Subsidies are being dramatically reduced or eliminated all together, including rail, electricity and feedstock. One producer we spoke with suggested that met roughly $25 to $30 per ton cost increase for them.
And there's a heightened awareness and significant pressure being applied both at the central and local government levels regarding the significant environmental impact caused by these facilities. All of these points to just, in fact, almost every group we met with expects that significant capacity will be removed from China over the next several years.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, then I'll ramp up made a few final thoughts. Bert?"

Entering the quarter, pricing and demand were low and the industry outlook wasn't very positive. As Tony mentioned, in North America, urea traded at less than $200 per ton in U.S. Gulf at the beginning of the quarter, which we considered unsustainable. As such, we decided to position the company for unimproved forward market. As spring weather broke early in many parts of the country, we began selling into the market as prices quickly rebounded. 
prices began to rise in mid-February and continued pricing through March, with urea and the Gulf topping out at $270 a ton and prices in the corn belt trading above $300 per ton. 
In addition to the earlier arrival of spring weather, low prices of the begin of the quarter did not attract a high level of imports of factory and UAN to North America, which also aided the rebound and led to nitrogen Q1 supply being short in the corn belt.
Shipment and application activities were strong in March for ammonia, UAN -- and UAN, but especially for ammonia. Warm dry weather came early and farmers in the Southern Plains and Midwest were prepared and ammonia sales in those regions marked one of our best starts to a spring season. To put this into perspective, the previous record shipment for March out of our Blair, Nebraska terminal was 38,000 tons. In March, we surpassed 62,000 tons. That means that the terminal had to, on average, load 4 trucks an hour, 24 hours a day every day of the month. 
Our consolidated sales volume for the quarter was very strong, up approximately 39% year-over-year, aided by the addition of CF fertilizers U.K. and our capacity expansions. We also load direct quarter for the production of urea at approximately 819 tons. 
Looking to the global markets, reduction in feedstock costs continue to have a big impact in the first quarter of 2016, along with currency devaluations. However, global cost appear to have hit floor levels in the first quarter of 2016. The coal supply is low. Coal prices found the bottom in December and have remained stable since. Similarly, the global oil situation is still low on supply, but prices have begun to recover from the lows in January.
Ocean freight rates have declined substantially due to oversupply of both vessels and lower fuel prices, but it appears that after 2 years of decline, these costs has hit the floor as well. 
Export activity from China was down almost 38% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016 as the global prices continued to fall, high-cost Chinese after site called-based producers began to curtail production and limited ton ship to the ports for export. 
In addition, Chinese fertilizer industry publications recently stated that several urea producers in China were permanently shut down in 2015, which was the first time ever in that reductions have exceeded new production coming online.
Additionally, the Chinese Nitrogen Fertilizer Associations 2016 to 2020 Development Plan culture more of the smaller old plants to be faced out by the end of the decade, reducing the country's ammonia capacity by an estimated 10 million metric tons per year and the urea capacity by 13 million metric tons per year. All of these data points lead us to believe that our view of the global cost curve is reasonably accurate. 
Moving onto North American natural gas. The market began the first quarter with unexpectedly cold January that changed in the gas market's focus from how good prices could potentially fall to high quickly prices could climb. Henry Hub, Gas Daily, was trading at $1.54 on December 28, 2015, and reached prices as high as $2.53 only 15 days later on January 12. 
This rally was short-lived as prices decline due to the latter half of January and into the beginning of March. The declining price was due to a collapse of gas weighted heating degree days that far exceed even the mildest projections, underperforming industrial demand and slower-than-anticipated LNG exports. The combination of these factors led to an end of March storage balance just under 2.5 TCF, 54% higher than the 5-year average and more than 1 TCF higher than last year.
We believe this abundant resource will continue to provide CF with a competitive advantage over other global producers for the foreseeable future.
The outlook for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 remains positive. But with did capacity coming online globally over the next 12 months, we expect nitrogen pricing to remain under pressure. We expect urea demand at the U.S. Gulf to be continued to be relatively from through the spring application season. 
On the agriculture front, economics continue to support planting corn over soybeans, and our planted corn forecast is 92 million acres with further upside possible given a favorable USDA's survey for spring planting intentions. Corn growth is forecasted at 2% for the fertilizer year 2016 and '17 as demand is expected to rebound near 2014 levels. And December corn is currently trading near $3.90 per bushel, all positive signs for the farmer and for our business.
Now let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the first quarter of 2016, we generated $217 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were on a pretax basis, approximately $42 million of net foreign currency losses, $21 unrealized mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives, $16 million in expansion cost for our Donaldsonville important new facilities and $14 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture. 
When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $300 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.40. 
Included in these results, the realized loss of $56 million or $0.79 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2016. This compares to realized loss of $32  million or $0.52 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges in the first quarter of 2015. 
During the first quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2016, the company placed into service the new UAN plant at Donaldsonville. This expect to place into service the new ammonia at Donaldsonville and the new ammonia and urea plant at Port Neal later this year. 
As we mentioned in our last call, most of these assets will qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the passage of the Pact Act by Congress last year. 
As a result of these additional assets being placed into service, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year. 
I'd like to take a brief moment to describe the mechanics of the CHS strategic venture. On February 1, 2016, we received $2.8 billion in our cash account related to this investment. Each quarter, we recognized a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which for the first quarter was $17 million. However, the cash distribution payables semiannually to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period based on the terms of the agreement, which, in effect, provides reduced economics to CHS. The estimate of this distribution pertaining to the first quarter is approximately $30 million.
Moving on. For 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, of which, $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion will be used to the capacity expansion of private and the other $500 million to $600 million for sustaining improvement of other projects. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

I want to summarize why we continue to be so excited and optimistic about our business. The fundamentals of our business remains strong. There is a growing demand for our products, and we benefit from low-cost North American gas.
Our consolidated gross margin was 30%, x the impact of gas hedges and our cash margins for incremental production are 50% or better. Our plants are running well. We had record production for urea in the first quarter and one of the top 3 quarters for ammonia production as well. 
We fully expect to hit an all-time record for UAN production here in Q2 with the new diesel plant online. The expansion projects are almost done. We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plants and within 2 months of being mechanically complete at Port Neal, so the spending is quickly coming to an end. When those plants are online, they will increase our productive capacity by more than 25% and, along with it, our corresponding cash flow generation as well.
Our balanced sheet credit metrics and liquidity are all strong. We have a solid investment grade rating, we have a $2 billion undrawn revolver and we have $2.7 billion of cash on the balanced sheet at quarter end. 
Finally, bonus depreciation will provide a significant cash flow benefit this year and next.
So although the pricing environment is weaker than we'd like, nonetheless, we are extremely excited about the bright future ahead and what the next few months hold for us.

And we decided at that point it was more appropriate for us to utilize our storage capabilities and our terminus system and that is one is our plant space and prepare for a market that we believe would come later in Q1, which was then materialized or start to materialize in February as prices started to be going into spring. So you've seen us over the years take different tactics at the market. Sometimes we had sold forward in previous year. We don't do it as much of that anymore. And we're playing on a global market where we've looked at opportunities, both inside North America and outside their markets. We have relationships around the world, and we intend to utilize those capabilities as well as flexible production options because that's how we built these plants for new plants that coming online to be tremendously flexible for us in terms of going full UAN, full urea or even full ammonia as we have it during this Q1 period satisfied the high ammonia demand we had."

So we about the forward curve through that period, as that forward curve rise and different tax rises, it may fall as well.  We don't know. So if you think about where that forward curve is, when we valued it at quarter's end at March 31 versus where it may move through time in the quarter, that will have a change on sort of the mark-to-market. Because the mark-to-market stuff that you're seeing is in relation to hedges that have not been realized yet as they've not closed out. So if you go through times, few things are happening. More of those things are being realized sort of effectively falling off the forward map. And at the same time, the curve is rising and falling versus the price on those curves. You saw the add up on the MMBtus and then the difference between where any given point is on the curve and where we are on the hedge curve, which we've disclosed.

You have to understand that Q1 is not necessarily an ammonia application period, although as we stated in our prepared remarks, we had record pull out of our player terminal. And that was a phenomenal. In Q1, it was predominantly in that Nebraska region. However, just as prices were very low in January for urea, there also a very low for ammonia. We have not only on the import market, which is Tampa-driven, which is a 3 10 a metric ton or about $280 a short ton. That number got pulled into the United States in several regions and prices were low. And we took the same tactic that we did with urea, we decided not to sell into the market. The industrial percentage of our business in Q1 is higher and that most industrial contractors are gas based during that 3 $2 [ph] gas. And again, Tampa base, so I already gave you the Tampa number. We also had an export vessel, 25,000 tons that we exported at Tampa equivalents or a little bit below that. All that to say that the weight of that -- of the Q1 number was pushed more towards the industrial side of our business. You'll see that revert back to more of a traditional strip for Q2 as that's more of an  base quarter."

So as Tony said in his remarks, we spent a week, a little over 10 days in Asia. We went to some other places. And the consistent message coming out of China for us was one of they're going through a change. And as we've said, in the past, each year seems to be a different economic year coming out of China. And centers are different, subsidies are different, taxes are different, production levels are different. And today, they're really struggling to try to find their way and trying different steps in order to maintain profitability. Last year, that step was record export. We just don't see that going forward. It's unsustainable. And what they were doing last year was just sending products of the ports. The entire we visited last year, there was probably 2 million, 2.5 million tons sitting in bags at the port ready for export unsold. What we're seeing transit has a transition to a more market-based decisions as we've heard from several traders and participants that until they sell those tons, they're not going to move them to the port. A great economic decision, which we think will present some of the low prices that were coming in last year. So economics are driving a lot of decisions on how they look at efficiencies, how they look at investments, how they are looking at shipments. And this year, first quarter and into the second quarter, the domestic market was much more profitable than the export market and you saw a lot of produces pull away from the export market. So I think it's a maturing. They're understanding what their options are. In 2011, '12 and '13 when urea was over $400, everybody made money. It was an easy decision to participate in produce. That's no longer going to be the case of the several high-cost producers those at the site coal produces. And we think rationalization will continue. On environmental front, all I can tell you is it's dirty. And we drove to several places in several cities in both Tommy and I were amazed. You see the pictures in the newspapers, it's a different in real life. And you almost could cut through it and you can see every half a mile away. you drive by rivers, you drive by piles of garbage.

So what you see today is there are 2 price levels in NOLA for Chinese and non-Chinese. But we are an important market. And an import market will draw tons from everywhere, Middle East, Russia, Asia. And today, chinese product trades at a discount. And I think as long as it trades with a differential low enough, people will buy it. That being said, Chinese participation -- Chinese product participation in the North America market looks to be declining. You have a few to bring it and blended. And so what we see going forward, I think the story, the broad story where we're communicating today is that a part of these changes is probably Chinese product will remain more and more in Asia, maybe go into South America a little bit.

And so we've heard this noise about it's going to become a balanced market, but the people who say that include Trinidad tons as part of the North American balance. And the last time I looked on the map, Trinidad wasn't part of North America. my geography teacher thought. So there's notion somehow that the end market premium is going away. I'd say show me where the production is that's going to make that happen. Someone still has to bid those tons into the marketplace in order for there to be enough nitrogen to hit the ground in the corn belt. And that's not happening organically from new steel in the ground in that region. So we don't see that happening.

One  of which as we announced relative to the PMH business we had and unscheduled downtime in Verdigris for one of our ammonia plants and that also carried on to one of the UAN plants there was well. And so as a result of unscheduled downtime, we ended up with a fair bit of fixed overhead absorption into that business without the corresponding production plants that go along with it. On the distribution side, Bert has really led some investments that we've made at the distribution terminals to allow them to both receive inbound and also export outbound ammonium market quickly, which allows us to have a kind of results we did at Blair in the first quarter leading into the second quarter. And so as some of the initiatives like the 4 hours some that Bert talked about means that we'll see likely less ammonia going down in the fall being able to really pump it out hard in the spring as a critical thing. And that's part of the reason why we've made the investments that we've had is to really shifts and be able to move those tons quickly. Of the other thing that you got to look at, I'd say, Matthew, is we do have now both the urea and UAN plants that the Donaldsonville operating, and so we do have quite a bit more depreciation expense that's going to be rolling through the P&L than what we've had in the past. And as we bring on the ammonia plant and then Port Neal, you're going to see those depreciation numbers continue to climb.  So while that is an important to look at, can be really focused on cash flow generation, and so our focus, the thing that we would point you to has really take a hard look at how much operating cash flow we're generating going forward as a much better metric ton the distortion of what the new depreciation is going to be in terms of the underlying health and economics of the business."

The huge domestic market estimates or when you include industrial demand as well as agricultural demand for urea and ammonium sulfate. It is large, and I do think it's going to grow. But change in crop subsidies for corn and how that's going to impact probably will have some changes, but I don't think as much as people are anticipating. So relative to the rest of the role of their domestic demand period and enter Q2 into Q3, we think exports we've said are going to be around 10 million tons for the year. We're still with that number, so off about 4 million tons from last year. I think there's going to be some prolonged downtimes at several plants. I don't think we do see the push to stop the ports for exports. We have to see this develop and see if our hypothesis holds true."

I think it's a really good one, which is everyone we spoke with, in fact the general manager of the port operations and all the as well is that, that the producers are not just blindly shipping product into the port and then have that available for the traders to kind of cover short positions in the tenders the way they used to do. They're being much more rational about only taking product to port, and a they've made some investments on railroad out and load in infrastructure, and so forth, in order to be able to move quickly. And so they're waiting until they actually see business that they want to take before they start moving product to port. And that's one of the reasons that they claim anyway that they've had some better discipline in terms of pricing into some of these tenders this year than they have in the past, which is its fundamentally different behavior on the part of the producers. And they're getting away from letting the traders just short these tenders like crazy and then going to the overflowing ports to cover. And so we think not only is the rationalization of capacity improving kind of the overall market dynamics, but the behavioral aspect of it is really important as well."

It did vary quite a bit from $100 to $150 a ton. And we did have tons available to sell, and we anticipate that we have captured a pretty good part of that. You're correct. There is capacity coming online in UAN for us, urea with CS and some others as well as ammonia. The price protection is not in the mix. What we have seen happen is flat potash and phosphate on price protection is really a short-term gain, long-term loss. And as you put product in the inventory for periods like this spring when you could have had price appreciation, you do not get that and it creates a negative dynamic in the market that the risk stays with the producer, and you continue to push their product out from logistical basis and it just doesn't help the market at all. We believe that we need to price our products appropriately for our retail and wholesale customers. And at the risk then stays with them, then they get a reward when they sell and they provide services, they provide different products. It's part of their product portfolio.

Last night, we posted CF Industries' 2016 first quarter results in which we generated EBITDA of $207 million.

Last night, we posted CF Industries' 2016 first quarter results in which we generated EBITDA of $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million after taking into account net foreign currency losses, mark-to-market hedge losses, transaction costs related to CHS and OCI and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.
The difficult market conditions in North America from late last year persisted into the early part of this year. However, as demand developed with the onset of spring, prices quickly moved up into the range we believe represents sustainable prices for the industry. Although industry publications reported January and February we're repricing NOLA well below $200, our realized price for the quarter was $256 a ton.
Our reported gross margin was $217 million or 22% of approximately $1 billion of net sales. What I want to focus on is the strength in the underlying fundamentals of our business. To really understand those fundamentals, it is necessary to strip away the noise in short-term timing issues and look at just the core business. Excluding the impact of our natural gas hedges, consolidated gross margin would have been $294 million or around 30%. The unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss was $21 million, and the realized natural gas derivative loss was $56 million for a total impact of $77 million associated with natural gas hedges. Over time, as the hedge position roles off, that noise will disappear and the core business will shine through.
As we talked about on our last call and as shown on Slide 12 of our materials, even at our urea price of $200 per ton, a typical U.S. Gulf producer generates roughly 50% cash margins on each incremental ton, and into this attractive environment that we are bringing on our new capacity additions.
Our new urea plant at Donaldsonville was placed into service last November and is reliably operating 10% to 15% above nameplate capacity. Our new Donaldsonville nitric acid and UAN plants were placed into service in March and are reliably operating 15% to 20% above nameplate capacity, and we haven't even pushed them to the limit yet.
We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant and are in the process of precommissioning and commissioning activities. So the burn rate spend there has wound back considerably. And we expect to be fully mechanically complete at Port Neal by the end of the second quarter, meaning our spending on the new projects will largely be wrapped up in the next 2 months.
Finally, during the first quarter, our strategic venture with the CHS commenced. We received $2.8 billion in cash and began selling urea and UAN to them at market prices.
On a global basis, capacity additions, along with lower feedstock cost and cheaper ocean freight, have led to a widening and flattening of the global cost curve over the last year. However, due to sustained annual growth in nitrogen demand, even with all of the additional capacity, during periods with more robust demand, higher cost tons must be bid into the market. We believe the Chinese anthracite coal-based facilities will continue to be the marginal cost producers for the foreseeable future, setting the global cost forth.
In fact, Bert and I recently spent a week in China and met with about 10 different industry participants at their plants, the ports and their offices to gain additional insights into the evolving dynamics in China. Over the course of several days and over 1,000 miles travel, we came away with a few key themes: one, there are broad-based expectations that the nitrogen fertilizer industry will continue to rationalize, closing high cost inefficient plants. It is estimated that between 50% and 60% of the installed industry capacity in China is still anthracite-based coal production, and these facilities, along with certain gas plants, are the ones most at risk; subsidies are being dramatically reduced or eliminated all together, including rail, electricity and feedstock. One producer we spoke with suggested that meant roughly $25 to $30 per ton cost increase for them; and there's a heightened awareness and significant pressure being applied both at the central and local government levels regarding the significant environmental impact caused by these facilities. All of these points suggest that, in fact, almost every group we met with expects that significant capacity will be removed from China over the next several years.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, then I'll wrap up with a few final thoughts. Bert?"

The first quarter was definitely a tale of 2 very different time periods. Entering the quarter, pricing and demand were low and the industry outlook wasn't very positive.

Entering the quarter, pricing and demand were low and the industry outlook wasn't very positive. As Tony mentioned, in North America, urea traded at less than $200 per ton in the U.S. Gulf at the beginning of the quarter, which we considered unsustainable. As such, we decided to position the company for an improved forward market. As spring weather broke early in many parts of the country, we began selling into the market as prices quickly rebounded.
Prices began to rise in mid-February and continued rising through March with urea at the Gulf topping out at $270 a ton and prices in the corn belt trading above $300 per ton. In addition to the earlier arrival of spring weather, low prices at the beginning of the quarter did not attract a high level of imports of urea and UAN to North America, which also aided the rebound and led to nitrogen Q1 supply being short in the corn belt.
Shipment and application activities were strong in March for ammonia, urea and UAN, but especially for ammonia. Warm dry weather came early, and farmers in the Southern Plains and Midwest were prepared, and ammonia sales in those regions marked one of our best starts to a spring season. To put this into perspective, the previous record shipment for March out of our Blair, Nebraska terminal was 38,000 tons. In March, we surpassed 62,000 tons. That means that the terminal had to, on average, load 4 trucks an hour, 24 hours a day, every day of the month.
Our consolidated sales volume for the quarter was very strong, up approximately 39% year-over-year, aided by the addition of CF Fertilisers UK and our capacity expansions. We also logged directive [ph] quarter for the production of urea at approximately 819,000 tons.
Looking to the global markets, reduction in feedstock costs continued to have a big impact in the first quarter of 2016, along with currency devaluations. However, global costs appear to have hit floor levels in the first quarter of 2016. Though coal supply is long, coal prices found the bottom in December and have remained stable since. Similarly, the global oil situation is still long supply, but prices have begun to recover from the lows in January.
Ocean freight rates have declined substantially due to oversupply of both vessels and lower fuel prices, but it appears that after 2 years of decline, these costs had hit the floor as well.
Export activity from China was down almost 38% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016. As global prices continued to fall, high-cost Chinese anthracite coal-based producers began to curtail production and limited tons shipped to the ports for export. In addition, Chinese fertilizer industry publications recently stated that several urea producers in China were permanently shut down in 2015, which was the first time ever that reductions have exceeded new production coming online.
Additionally, the Chinese nitrogen fertilizer associations 2016 through 2020 development plan calls for more of the smaller old plants to be phased out by the end of the decade, reducing the country's ammonia capacity by an estimated 10 million metric tons per year and the urea capacity by 13 million metric tons per year. All of these data points lead us to believe that our view of the global cost curve is reasonably accurate.
Moving on to North America natural gas. The market began the first quarter with unexpectedly cold January that changed the gas market's focus from how low prices could potentially fall to how quickly prices could climb. Henry Hub gas daily was trading at $1.54 on December 28, 2015, and reached prices as high as $2.53 only 15 days later on January 12. This price rally was short-lived as prices decline through to latter half of January and into the beginning of March. The declining price was due to a collapse of gas-weighted heating degree days that far exceeded even the mildest projections, underperforming industrial demand and slower-than-anticipated LNG exports. The combination of these factors led to an end of March storage balance just under 2.5 Tcf, 54% higher than the 5-year average and more than 1 Tcf higher than last year. We believe this abundant resource will continue to provide CF with a competitive advantage over other global producers for the foreseeable future.
The nitrogen outlook for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 remains positive. But with new capacity coming online globally over the next 12 months, we expect nitrogen pricing to remain under pressure. We expect urea demand at the U.S. Gulf to continue to be relatively firm through the spring application season.
On the agricultural front, economics continue to support planting corn over soybeans, and our planted corn forecast is 92 million acres with further upside possible given a favorable USDA's survey for spring planting intentions. Corn use growth is forecasted at 2% for the fertilizer year 2016 and '17 as demand is expected to rebound near 2014 levels. And December corn is currently trading near $3.90 per bushel, all positive signs for the farmer and for our business.
Now let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the first quarter of 2016, we generated $217 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11.

In the first quarter of 2016, we generated $217 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were, on a pretax basis, approximately $42 million of net foreign currency losses, $21 unrealized mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives, $16 million in expansion cost for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities and $14 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $300 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.40.
Included in these results is a realized loss of $56 million or $0.79 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2016. This compares to realized loss of $32  million or $0.52 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2015.
During the first quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2016, the company placed into service the new UAN plant at Donaldsonville. We expect to place into service the new ammonia plant at Donaldsonville and the new ammonia and urea plants at Port Neal later this year.
As we mentioned on our last call, most of these assets will qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the passage of the PATH Act by Congress last year. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.
I want to take a brief moment to describe the mechanics of the CHS strategic venture. On February 1, 2016, we received $2.8 billion in our cash account related to this investment. Each quarter, we recognize a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which, for the first quarter, was $17 million. However, the cash distribution payables semiannually to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period based on the terms of the agreement, which, in effect, provides a producer economics to CHS. The estimate of this distribution pertaining to the first quarter is approximately $30 million.
Moving on, for 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, of which, $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion will be used for the capacity expansion projects and the other $500 million to $600 million for sustaining improvement at other projects.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

I want to summarize why we continue to be so excited and optimistic about our business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. There is a growing demand for our products, and we benefit from low-cost North American gas.
Our consolidated gross margin was 30%, ex the impact of gas hedges, and our cash margins for incremental production are 50% or better. Our plants are running well. We had record production for urea in the first quarter and one of the top 3 quarters for ammonia production as well.
We fully expect to hit an all-time record for UAN production here in Q2 with the new diesel plant online. The expansion projects are almost done. We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant and within 2 months of being mechanically complete at Port Neal, so the spending is quickly coming to an end. When those plants are online, they will increase our productive capacity by more than 25% and, along with it, our corresponding cash flow generation as well.
Our balanced sheet credit metrics and liquidity are all strong. We have a solid investment grade rating. We have a $2 billion undrawn revolver, and we have $2.7 billion of cash on the balanced sheet at the quarter end. Finally, bonus depreciation will provide a significant cash flow benefits this year and next.
So although the pricing environment is weaker than we'd like, nonetheless, we are extremely excited about the bright future ahead and what the next few months hold for us.

And we decided at that point it was more appropriate for us to utilize our storage capabilities and our terminal system and that -- as well as our plant space and prepare for a market that we believe would come later in Q1, which was then materialized or started to materialize in February as prices started to improve going into spring. So you've seen us over the years take different tactics into the market. Sometimes we have sold forward in previous years. We don't do as much of that anymore. And we're playing on a global market where we've looked at opportunities, both inside North America and outside different markets. We have relationships around the world, and we intend to utilize those capabilities as well as flexible production options because that's how we built these plants, the new plants that are coming online, to be tremendously flexible for us in terms of going full UAN, full urea or even full ammonia as we have it during this Q1 period to satisfy the high ammonia demand we had."

Why don't I start with the financial gas hedge and how to start to think about that? Without getting into specific numbers, I think it's really easy that if you think about the disclosures that we've made in the past, we've disclosed how many MMBtus we have hedged going forward, and there was a graph, I think, that we've put out in -- as part of the 4Q earnings release that basically mapped out exactly what those hedges are going through time and where they're priced. So as you think about the forward curve through that period, as that forward curve rises, if, in fact, it rises, it may fall as well. We don't know. So as we think about where that forward curve is when we valued it at quarter's end here at March 31 versus where it may move to through time in the quarter, that will have a change on sort of the mark-to-market because the mark-to-market stuff that you're seeing is in relation to hedges that have not been realized, that have been not closed out. So as they go through time, 2 things are happening: more of those things are being realized or effectively falling off the forward map; and at the same time, the curve is rising and falling versus the price on those curves. You sort of add up the MMBtus and then the difference between where any given point is on the curve and where we are on the hedge curve, which we've disclosed, you can kind of come out at that way mathematically."

It was predominantly in that Nebraska region. However, just as prices were very low in January for urea, they are also a very low for ammonia. We had not only on the import market, which is Tampa-driven, which is at $310 a metric ton or about $280 a short ton, that number got pulled into the United States in several regions, and prices were low. And we took the same tactic that we did with the urea. We decided not to sell into that market. The industrial percentage of our business in Q1 is higher, and that most industrial contracts are gas-based during that period at $2 gas. And again, Tampa base, so I already gave you the Tampa number. We also had an export vessel, 25,000 tons that we exported at Tampa. Equivalents were a little bit below that. All that to say that the weight of that -- of the Q1 number was pushed more towards the industrial side of our business. You'll see that revert back to more of a traditional strip for Q2 as that's more of an ag base quarter."

So Tony and I did -- as Tony said in his remarks, spent a week, a little over 10 days, in Asia. We went to some other places. And the consistent message coming out of China for us was one of they're going through a change. And as we've said in the past, each year seems to be a different economic year coming out of China. Incentives are different. Subsidies are different. Taxes are different. Production levels are different. And today, they're really struggling trying to find their way and trying different steps in order to maintain profitability. Last year, that step was record exports. We just don't see that going forward. It's unsustainable. And what they were doing last year was just sending products to the ports. The entire [ph] we visited last year, there was probably 2 million, 2.5 million tons sitting in bags at the port ready for export unsold. What we're seeing transit -- as a transition to more market-based decisions is we've heard from several traders and participants that until they sell those tons, they're not going to move them to the port. A great economic decision, which we think will present some of the low prices that were coming in last year. So economics are driving a lot of decisions on how they look at -- on efficiencies, how they look at investments, how they're looking at shipments. And this year, first quarter and into the second quarter, the domestic market was much more profitable than the export market, and you saw a lot of producers pull away from the export market. So I think it's a maturing, and they're understanding what their options are. In 2011, '12 and '13 when urea was over $400, everybody made money. It was an easy decision to participate and produce. That's no longer going to be the case for several of the high-cost producers, those anthracite coal producers. And we think rationalization will continue. On an environmental front, all I can tell you is it's dirty. And we drove to several places in several cities, and both Tony and I were amazed. You see the pictures in the newspapers, it's different in real life. And you almost could cut through it, and you could see maybe a half a mile away. You drive by rivers. You drive by piles of garbage. That can't continue. Just as we had rivers burn in the '60s and '70s in Wisconsin in Lake Erie, we had to make the same kind of changes that they're going to have to make. They're going to have to change their effluent streams. They're going to capture some of these gas streams, and that will all come in with investment, and environmental awareness will take place."

And I think as long as it trades at a differential low enough, people will buy it.

But from the North American perspective, it's mostly Arab Gulf, and the Chinese stuff is more around the French. So we see most of those tons being backed out. But North America is going to -- even after our projects come online and the other ones that are in construction today, North America will still import roughly 30% of its total nitrogen requirements. And so we've heard this noise about, oh, it's going to become a balanced market, but the people that say that include Trinidad tons as part of the North American balance. And the last time I looked on the map, Trinidad wasn't part of North America, used the way my geography teachers thought it. So there's notion, somehow, that the end market premium is going away. I'd say show me where the production is that's going to make that happen. Someone still has to bid those tons into the marketplace in order for there to be enough nitrogen to hit the ground into the corn belt. And that's not happening organically from new steel in the ground in that region. So we don't see that happening. Now yes, there is going to be a shifting trade balance as the new capacity comes online. We don't think Chinese tons make sense here anymore, but we're still pretty substantially an import marketplace."

One of which is as we announced relative to the TMH business we had and unscheduled downtime in Verdigris for one of our ammonia plants, and that also carried on to one of the UAN plants there was well. And so as a result of unscheduled downtime, we ended up with a fair bit of fixed overhead absorption into that business without the corresponding production tons that go along with it. On the distribution side, Bert has really led some investments that we've made at the distribution terminals to allow them to both receive inbound and also export outbound ammonium more quickly, which allows us to have a kind of results we did at Blair in the first quarter leading into the second quarter. And so as some of the initiatives like the 4Rs that Bert talked about means that we see likely less ammonia going down in the fall being able to really pump it out hard in the spring is a critical thing. And that's part of the reason why we've made the investments that we've had is to really shift and be able to move those tons quickly. The other thing that you got to look at, I'd say, Matthew, is we do have now both the urea and UAN plants at Donaldsonville operating, and so we do have quite a bit more depreciation expense that's going to be rolling through the P&L than what we've had in the past. And as we bring on the D'Ville ammonia plant and then Port Neal, you're going to see those depreciation numbers continue to climb. So while that's an important thing to look at, again, we really focus on cash flow generation. And so our focus, the thing that we would point you to is really take a hard look at how much operating cash flow we're generating going forward as a much better metric than the distortion of what the new depreciation is going to be in terms of the underlying health and economics of the business."

There's a huge domestic market estimates or when you include industrial demand as well as agricultural demand for urea and ammonium sulfate. It is large, and I do think it's going to grow. But change in crop subsidies for corn and how that's going to impact probably will have some change but I don't think as much as people are anticipating. So relative to as they roll off their domestic demand period and enter Q2 into Q3, we think exports, we've said, are going to be around 10 million tons for the year. We're still with that number, so off about 4 million tons from last year. I think there is going to be some prolonged downtimes at several plants.

I think it's a really good one, which is everyone we spoke with, in fact, the general manager of the port operations, and [indiscernible] called this out as well, which is that the producers are not just blindly shipping product into the port and then have it available for the traders to kind of cover short positions in the -- on tenders, the way they used to. They're being much more rational about only taking product to port, and they've made some investments on rail load-out and load-in infrastructure, and so forth, in order to be able to move quickly. And so they're waiting until they actually see business that they want to take before they start moving product to port. And that's one of the reasons that they claim anyway that they've had some better discipline in terms of pricing into some of these tenders this year than they have in the past, which is its fundamentally different behavior on the part of the producers.

So it was already the largest single-train UAN plant in the world. Even at nameplate, we're getting much, much better results on that already. And the way that we went about designing these plants was understanding from a process flow perspective where the bottlenecks were, what the things we needed to upsize where, and that's the same approach we've taken on the ammonia plant as well as at Port Neal. And so while it's a little early to claim victory on the ammonia production yet, our expectation is that we're going to be in a same kind of region, relative to production on the ammonia and also at Port Neal. And the important thing to also highlight, Adam, is that when we did the original investment thesis and justification, it was strictly based on nameplate production. So every incremental ton that we're getting off of these plants show up at that 50% to 60% cash margin number, and all of those are just sort of free cash into the equation on the economics of the plant. So we feel very good about where we are."

So I don't have exact numbers for you, but we're planning on a historical spring, 6-month period. We look at this as a 6-month cycle and -- for spring. And pricing, you're right. You're correct. It did rally quite a bit from $100 to $150 a ton. And we did have tons available to sell, and we anticipate that we have captured a pretty good part of that. You're correct, there is capacity coming online in UAN for us, urea with CF and some others as well as ammonia. The price protection is not in the mix. What we have seen happen with potash and phosphate on price protection is really a short-term gain, long-term loss. And as you put product in the inventory for periods like this spring when you could have had price appreciation, you do not get that, and it creates a negative dynamic in the market that the risk stays with the producer and you continue to push that product out from logistical basis, and it just doesn't help the market at all. We believe that we need to price our products appropriately for our retail and wholesale customers, and that the risk then stays with them. And they get a reward at -- when they sell and they provide services, they provide different products. It's part of their product portfolio. We're just 1 participant in that chain.

Last night, we posted CF Industries' 2016 first quarter results in which we generated EBITDA of $207 million.

Last night, we posted CF Industries' 2016 first quarter results in which we generated EBITDA of $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million after taking into account net foreign currency losses, mark-to-market hedge losses, transaction costs related to CHS and OCI and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.
The difficult market conditions in North America from late last year persisted into the early part of this year. However, as demand developed with the onset of spring, prices quickly moved up into the range we believe represents sustainable prices for the industry. Although industry publications reported January and February urea pricing in NOLA well below $200, our realized price for the quarter was $256 a ton.
Our reported gross margin was $217 million or 22% of approximately $1 billion of net sales. What I want to focus on is the strength in the underlying fundamentals of our business. To really understand those fundamentals, it is necessary to strip away the noise and short-term timing issues and look at just the core business. Excluding the impact of our natural gas hedges, consolidated gross margin would have been $294 million or around 30%. The unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss was $21 million, and the realized natural gas derivative loss was $56 million for a total impact of $77 million associated with natural gas hedges. Over time, as the hedge position rolls off, that noise will disappear and the core business will shine through.
As we talked about on our last call and is shown on Slide 12 of our materials, even at a urea price of $200 per ton, a typical U.S. Gulf producer generates roughly 50% cash margins on each incremental ton, and it is into this attractive environment that we are bringing on our new capacity additions.
Our new urea plant at Donaldsonville was placed into service last November and is reliably operating 10% to 15% above nameplate capacity. Our new Donaldsonville nitric acid and UAN plants were placed into service in March and are reliably operating 15% to 20% above nameplate capacity, and we haven't even pushed them to the limit yet.
We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant and are in the process of precommissioning and commissioning activities. So the burn rate spend there has wound back considerably. And we expect to be fully mechanically complete at Port Neal by the end of the second quarter, meaning our spending on the new projects will largely be wrapped up in the next 2 months.
Finally, during the first quarter, our strategic venture with the CHS commenced. We received $2.8 billion in cash and began selling urea and UAN to them at market prices.
On a global basis, capacity additions, along with lower feedstock cost and cheaper ocean freight, have led to a widening and flattening of the global cost curve over the last year. However, due to sustained annual growth in nitrogen demand, even with all of the additional capacity, during periods with more robust demand, higher cost tons must be bid  into the market. We believe the Chinese anthracite coal-based facilities will continue to be the marginal cost producers for the foreseeable future, setting the global cost form [ph].
In fact, Bert and I recently spent a week in China and met with about 10 different industry participants at their plants, the ports and their offices to gain additional insights into the evolving dynamics in China. Over the course of several days and over 1,000 miles traveled, we came away with a few key themes: one, there are broad-based expectations that the nitrogen fertilizer industry will continue to rationalize, closing high cost inefficient plants. It is estimated that between 50% and 60% of the installed industry capacity in China is still anthracite-based coal production, and these facilities, along with certain gas-fed plants, are the ones most at risk; subsidies are being dramatically reduced or eliminated all together, including rail, electricity and feedstock. One producer we spoke with suggested that meant roughly $25 to $30 per ton cost increase for them; and there's a heightened awareness and significant pressure being applied both at the central and local government levels regarding the significant environmental impact caused by these facilities. All of these points suggest that, in fact, almost every group we met with expects that significant capacity will be removed from China over the next several years.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, then I'll wrap up with a few final thoughts. Bert?"
22357184,331057102,974431,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. The first quarter was definitely a tale of 2 very different time periods. Entering the quarter, pricing and demand were low and the industry outlook wasn't very positive.

Entering the quarter, pricing and demand were low and the industry outlook wasn't very positive. As Tony mentioned, in North America, urea traded at less than $200 per ton in the U.S. Gulf at the beginning of the quarter, which we considered unsustainable. As such, we decided to position the company for an improved forward market. As spring weather broke early in many parts of the country, we began selling into the market as prices quickly rebounded.
Prices began to rise in mid-February and continued rising through March with urea at the Gulf topping out at $270 a ton and prices in the corn belt trading above $300 per ton. In addition to the early arrival of spring weather, low prices at the beginning of the quarter did not attract a high level of imports of urea and UAN to North America, which also aided the rebound and led to nitrogen Q1 supply being short in the corn belt.
Shipment and application activities were strong in March for ammonia, urea and UAN, but especially for ammonia. Warm dry weather came early, and farmers in the Southern Plains and Midwest were prepared, and ammonia sales in those regions marked one of our best starts to a spring season. To put this into perspective, the previous record shipment for March out of our Blair, Nebraska terminal was 38,000 tons. In March, we surpassed 62,000 tons. That means that the terminal had to, on average, load 4 trucks an hour, 24 hours a day, every day of the month.
Our consolidated sales volume for the quarter was very strong, up approximately 39% year-over-year, aided by the addition of CF Fertilisers UK and our capacity expansions. We also logged a record quarter for the production of urea at approximately 819,000 tons.
Looking to the global markets, reduction in feedstock costs continued to have a big impact in the first quarter of 2016, along with currency devaluations. However, global costs appear to have hit floor levels in the first quarter of 2016. Though coal supply is long, coal prices found the bottom in December and have remained stable since. Similarly, the global oil situation is still long supply, but prices have begun to recover from the lows in January.
Ocean freight rates have declined substantially due to oversupply of both vessels and lower fuel prices, but it appears that after 2 years of decline, these costs had hit a floor as well.
Export activity from China was down almost 38% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016. As global prices continued to fall, high-cost Chinese anthracite coal-based producers began to curtail production and limit the tons shipped to the ports for export. In addition, Chinese fertilizer industry publications recently stated that several urea producers in China were permanently shut down in 2015, which was the first time ever that reductions have exceeded new production coming online.
Additionally, the Chinese nitrogen fertilizer associations' 2016 through 2020 development plan calls for more of the smaller old plants to be phased out by the end of the decade, reducing the country's ammonia capacity by an estimated 10 million metric tons per year and the urea capacity by 13 million metric tons per year. All of these data points lead us to believe that our view of the global cost curve is reasonably accurate.
Moving on to North America natural gas. The market began the first quarter with unexpectedly cold January that changed the gas market's focus from how low prices could potentially fall to how quickly prices could climb. Henry Hub gas daily was trading at $1.54 on December 28, 2015, and reached prices as high as $2.53 only 15 days later on January 12. This price rally was short-lived as prices declined through to latter half of January and into the beginning of March. The declining price was due to a collapse of gas-weighted heating degree days that far exceeded even the mildest projections, underperforming industrial demand and slower-than-anticipated LNG exports. The combination of these factors led to an end of March storage balance just under 2.5 Tcf, 54% higher than the 5-year average and more than 1 Tcf higher than last year. We believe this abundant resource will continue to provide CF with a competitive advantage over other global producers for the foreseeable future.
The nitrogen outlook for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 remains positive. But with new capacity coming online globally over the next 12 months, we expect nitrogen pricing to remain under pressure. We expect urea demand at the U.S. Gulf to continue to be relatively firm through the spring application season.
On the agricultural front, economics continue to support planting corn over soybeans, and our planted corn forecast is 92 million acres with further upside possible given a favorable USDA survey for spring planting intentions. Corn use growth is forecasted at 2% for the fertilizer year 2016 and '17 as demand is expected to rebound near 2014 levels. And December corn is currently trading near $3.90 per bushel, all positive signs for the farmer and for our business.
Now let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the first quarter of 2016, we generated $217 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were, on a pretax basis, approximately $42 million of net foreign currency losses, $21 million unrealized mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives, $16 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities and $14 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $300 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.40.
Included in these results is a realized loss of $56 million or $0.79 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2016. This compares to realized loss of $32  million or $0.52 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2015.
During the first quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2016, the company placed into service the new UAN plant at Donaldsonville. We expect to place into service the new ammonia plant at Donaldsonville and the new ammonia and urea plants at Port Neal later this year.
As we mentioned on our last call, most of these assets will qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the passage of the PATH Act by Congress last year. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.
I want to take a brief moment to describe the mechanics of the CHS strategic venture. On February 1, 2016, we received $2.8 billion in our cash account related to this investment. Each quarter, we recognize a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which, for the first quarter, was $17 million. However, the cash distribution payable semiannually to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period based on the terms of the agreement, which, in effect, provides producer economics to CHS. The estimate of this distribution pertaining to the first quarter is approximately $30 million.
Moving on, for 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, of which, $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion will be used for the capacity expansion projects and the other $500 million to $600 million for sustaining improvement at other projects.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

I want to summarize why we continue to be so excited and optimistic about our business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. There is a growing demand for our products, and we benefit from low-cost North American gas.
Our consolidated gross margin was 30%, ex the impact of gas hedges, and our cash margins for incremental production are 50% or better. Our plants are running well. We had record production for urea in the first quarter and one of the top 3 quarters for ammonia production as well.
We fully expect to hit an all-time record for UAN production here in Q2 with the new diesel plant online. The expansion projects are almost done. We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant and within 2 months of being mechanically complete at Port Neal, so the spending is quickly coming to an end. When those plants are online, they will increase our productive capacity by more than 25% and, along with it, our corresponding cash flow generation as well.
Our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity are all strong. We have a solid investment grade rating. We have a $2 billion undrawn revolver, and we have $2.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the quarter end. Finally, bonus depreciation will provide us significant cash flow benefits this year and next.
So although the pricing environment is weaker than we'd like, nonetheless, we are extremely excited about the bright future ahead and what the next few months hold for us.
With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Operator?"

Looking at Q1 and the start of Q1 and at the low level of customer advances was a direct reflection of our view of the market that, at that time, going out of Q4 and into Q1, that prices that were at that point available to us in the North American market just were not attractive, and we're a bit -- probably levels even below that. And we decided at that point it was more appropriate for us to utilize our storage capabilities and our terminal system and that -- as well as our plant space and prepare for a market that we believed would come later in Q1, which was then materialized or started to materialize in February as prices started to improve going into spring. So you've seen us over the years take different tactics into the market. Sometimes we have sold forward in previous years. We don't do as much of that anymore. And we're playing on a global market where we've looked at opportunities, both inside North America and outside to different markets. We have relationships around the world, and we intend to utilize those capabilities as well as flexible production options because that's how we've built these plants, the new plants that are coming online, to be tremendously flexible for us in terms of going full UAN, full urea or even full ammonia as we have it during this Q1 period to satisfy the high ammonia demand we had."

Why don't I start with the natural gas hedge and how to sort of think about that? Without getting into specific numbers, I think it's really easy that if you think about the disclosures about what we've made in the past. We've disclosed how many MMBtus we have hedged going forward, and there was a graph, I think, that we've put out in -- as part of the 4Q earnings release that basically mapped out exactly what those hedges are going through time and where they're priced. So as you think about the forward curve through that period, as that forward curve rises, if, in fact, it rises, it may fall as well. We don't know. So as we think about where that forward curve is when we valued it at quarter's end here at March 31 versus where it may move to through time in the quarter, that will have a change on sort of the mark-to-market because the mark-to-market stuff that you're seeing is in relation to hedges that have not been realized, that have been not closed out. So as they go through time, 2 things are happening: more of those things are being realized, so they're effectively falling off the forward map; and at the same time, the curve is rising and falling versus the price on those curves. You sort of add up the MMBtus and then the difference between where any given point is on the curve and where we are on the hedge curve, which we've disclosed, you can kind of come at it that way mathematically."

However, just as prices were very low in January for urea, they were also a very low for ammonia. We had not only on the import market, which is Tampa-driven, which is at $310 a metric ton or about $280 a short ton, that number got pulled into the United States in several regions, and prices were low. And we took the same tactic that we did with the urea. We decided not to sell into that market. The industrial percentage of our business in Q1 is higher, and that -- most industrial contracts are gas-based,during that period, you had $2 gas. And again, Tampa based, so I already gave you the Tampa number. We also had an export vessel, 25,000 tons that we exported at Tampa equivalents or a little bit below that. All that to say that the weight of that -- of the Q1 number was pushed more towards the industrial side of our business. You'll see that revert back to more of a traditional strip for Q2 as that's more of an ag base quarter."

So Tony and I did -- as Tony said in his remarks, spent a week, a little over 10 days, in Asia. We went to some other places. And the consistent message coming out of China for us was one of they're going through a change. And as we've said in the past, each year seems to be a different economic year coming out of China. Incentives are different. Subsidies are different. Taxes are different. Production levels are different. And today, they're really struggling trying to find their way and trying different steps in order to maintain profitability. Last year, that step was record exports. We just don't see that going forward. It's unsustainable. And what they were doing last year was just sending product to the ports. Yantai, where we visited last year, there was probably 2 million, 2.5 million tons sitting in bags at the port ready for export unsold. What we're seeing transit -- as a transition to more market-based decisions is we've heard from several traders and participants that until they sell those tons, they're not going to move them to the port. A great economic decision, which we think will prevent some of the low prices that were coming in last year. So economics are driving a lot of decisions on how they look at -- on efficiencies, how they look at investments, how they're looking at shipments. And this year, first quarter and into the second quarter, the domestic market was much more profitable than the export market, and you saw a lot of producers pull away from the export market. So I think it's a maturing, and they're understanding what their options are. In 2011, '12 and '13 when urea was over $400, everybody made money. It was an easy decision to participate and produce. That's no longer going to be the case for several of the high-cost producers, those anthracite coal producers. And we think rationalization will continue. On an environmental front, all I can tell you is it's dirty. And we drove through several places in several cities, and both Tony and I were amazed. You see the pictures in the newspapers, it's different in real life. And you almost could cut through it, and you could see maybe a half a mile away. You drive by rivers. You drive by piles of garbage. That can't continue. Just as we had rivers burn in the '60s and '70s in Wisconsin and Lake Erie, we had to make the same kind of changes that they're going to have to make. They're going to have to change their effluent streams. They're going to have to capture some of these gas streams, and that will all come in with investment, and environmental awareness will take place."

There are good partners down there. We desire to monetize our position immediately and not take the risks that Tony mentioned. I do think there are changes to Petrobras's asset base that are coming.

And a lot of the comments we get back from our customers is they prefer not to buy it. So what you see today is there are 2 price levels in NOLA, for Chinese and non-Chinese. But we are an import market. And an import market will draw tons from everywhere, Middle East, Russia, Asia. And today, Chinese product trades at a discount. And I think as long as it trades at a differential low enough, people will buy it. That being said, Chinese participation and Chinese product participation in the North America market looks to be declining. You have a few that bring it in and blend it. And so what we see going forward, I think, the story, the broad story we're communicating today is that a part of these changes is probably Chinese product will remain more and more in Asia, maybe go into South America a little bit.

But from the North American perspective, it's mostly Arab Gulf, and the Chinese stuff is more around the fringe. So we see most of those tons being backed out. But North America is going to -- even after our projects come online and the other ones that are in construction today, North America will still import roughly 30% of its total nitrogen requirements. And so we've heard this noise about, oh, it's going to become a balanced market, but the people that say that include Trinidad tons as part of the North American balance. And the last time I looked on the map, Trinidad wasn't part of North America, at least the way my geography teachers taught it. So this notion, somehow, that the end market premium is going away, I'd say show me where the production is that's going to make that happen. Someone still has to bid those tons into the marketplace in order for there to be enough nitrogen to hit the ground in the corn belt. And that's not happening organically from new steel in the ground in that region. So we don't see that happening. Now yes, there is going to be a shifting trade balance as the new capacity comes online.

One of which is as we announced relative to the TNH business we had an unscheduled downtime in Verdigris for one of our ammonia plants, and that also carried on to one of the UAN plants there was well. And so as a result of unscheduled downtime, we ended up with a fair bit of fixed overhead absorption into that business without the corresponding production tons that go along with it. On the distribution side, Bert has really led some investments that we've made at the distribution terminals to allow them to both receive inbound and also export outbound ammonium more quickly, which allows us to have the kind of results we did at Blair in the first quarter leading into the second quarter. And so as some of the initiatives like the 4Rs that Bert talked about means that we see likely less ammonia going down in the fall being able to really pump it out hard in the spring is a critical thing. And that's part of the reason why we've made the investments that we've had is to really shift and be able to move those tons quickly. The other thing that you got to look at, I'd say, Matthew, is we do have now both the urea and UAN plants at Donaldsonville operating, and so we do have quite a bit more depreciation expense that's going to be rolling through the P&L than what we've had in the past. And as we bring on the D'Ville ammonia plant and then Port Neal, you're going to see those depreciation numbers continue to climb. So while that's an important thing to look at, again, we really focus on cash flow generation. And so our focus, the thing that we would point you to is really take a hard look at how much operating cash flow we're generating going forward, that's a much better metric than the distortion of what the new depreciation is going to be in terms of the underlying health and economics of the business."

And you've been reading about these and seeing pictures. We still have a lot of smaller operations in the South.

There's a huge domestic market estimates or when you include industrial demand as well as agricultural demand for urea and ammonium sulfate. It is large, and I do think it's going to grow. But a change in crop subsidies for corn and how that's going to impact probably will have some change but I don't think as much as people are anticipating. So relative to as they roll off their domestic demand period and enter Q2 into Q3, we think exports, we've said, are going to be around 10 million tons for the year. We're still with that number, so off about 4 million tons from last year. I think there is going to be some prolonged downtimes at several plants.

I think it's a really good one, which is everyone we spoke with, in fact, the general manager of the port operations at Yantai called this out as well, which is that the producers are not just blindly shipping product into the port and then have it available for the traders to kind of cover short positions in the -- on tenders, the way they used to. They're being much more rational about only taking product to port, and they've made some investments on rail load-out and load-in infrastructure, and so forth, in order to be able to move quickly. And so they're waiting until they actually see business that they want to take before they start moving product to port. And that's one of the reasons that they claim anyway that they've had some better discipline in terms of pricing into some of these tenders this year than they have in the past, which is it's fundamentally different behavior on the part of the producers. And they're getting away from letting the traders just short these tenders like crazy and then go into the overflowing ports to cover.

And again, as I've said, we haven't even really even pushed it to max rates yet, and so we think 20% is likely achievable at D'Ville UAN. So it was already the largest single-train UAN plant in the world even at nameplate. We're getting much, much better results on that already. And the way that we went about designing these plants was understanding from a process flow perspective where the bottlenecks were, what the things we needed to upsize where, and that's the same approach we've taken on the ammonia plant as well as at Port Neal. And so while it's a little early to claim victory on the ammonia production yet, our expectation is that we're going to be in a same kind of region, relative to production on the ammonia and also at Port Neal. And the important thing to also highlight, Adam, is that when we did the original investment thesis and justification, it was strictly based on nameplate production. So every incremental ton that we're getting off of these plants show up at that 50% to 60% cash margin number, and all of those are just sort of free cash into the equation on the economics of the plant. So we feel very good about where we are."

You're correct, there is capacity coming online in UAN for us, urea with CF and some others as well as ammonia. The price protection is not in the mix. What we have seen happen with potash and phosphate on price protection is it's really a short-term gain, long-term loss. And as you put product in the inventory for periods like this spring when you could have had price appreciation, you do not get that, and it creates a negative dynamic in the market that the risk stays with the producer and you continue to push that product out from logistical basis, and it just doesn't help the market at all. We believe that we need to price our products appropriately for our retail and wholesale customers, and that the risk then stays with them. And they get a reward at -- when they sell and they provide services, they provide different products. It's part of their product portfolio. We're just 1 participant in that chain.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the second quarter of 2016 in which we generated EBITDA of $329 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million after taking into account unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains, cost related to determination of the OCI transaction; net foreign currency losses on intercompany loans and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.
Included in these results and not adjusted for is a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $61 million. 
For the first half 2016, EBITDA was $536 million, while adjusted EBITDA was $642 million after taking into account the same factors as for the second quarter. The first half results included realized loss on natural gas hedges of $117 million, which was not adjusted for. 
So even with the challenging conditions in the gold fertilizer market, our underlying business performance remained strong. 
Before turning the call over to Bert and Dennis to give details on the quarter, I want to provide some observations and thoughts about the nitrogen market and our response to current industry conditions. There are some industry elements that are more structural and permanent in nature, while others tend to be more temporal. Fortunately, the elements that are structural tend to be strengthen and benefit CF. These include the global nitrogen demand continues to grow at roughly 2% per year, so there is strength underpinning our industry. Natural gas represents about 2/3 to 3/4 of the cash cost of producing nitrogen and North America has a long-term natural gas cost advantage.
North America is one of the largest nitrogen consumption regions where demand far exceeds domestic supply and, therefore, is heavily dependent upon imported products. 
CF is the world's low-cost nitrogen leader with the largest North American interior production and distribution system. CF's nitrogen ton production will increase by more than 25% in the next few months, and as a result, CF has the enviable position of being structural advantaged and one of the most profitable nitrogen manufacturers in the world with significant growth imminent. 
However, the industry is under pressure facing several significant challenges. Fortunately, these issues tend to be more transitory in nature and include the nitrogen industry as a state of significant overcapacity with additional new capacity yet to still come on stream through 2017. However, there is little-to-no new capacity additions currently in sight beyond 2017, and with underlying demand growth in nitrogen, the global supply-demand balance should start to resolve beginning in 2018. 
The combination of access nitrogen capacity with lower global energy cost, coupled with the valuation of certain key currencies and assisted by low freight have led to the dramatic fall in nitrogen product prices. We expect this situation to persist in the near term with prices under continued pressure in 2017.
However, even in these conditions, CF enjoys greater than 30% gross margins. I want to pause for a moment and reemphasize this last point. We operate in a commodity business, and even in the face of significant industry overcapacity with prices that have cratered, CF Industries was able to deliver first half 2016 gross margin of 35%. How was that possible in a commodity industry, you might ask? The answer is though although the global cost curve has widened with new capacity additions and has flattened because of lower global energy cost, it is certainly not flat, far from it. 
North America producers still enjoy a very significant advantage. With our realized price of urea roughly $250 per ton in the second quarter and with gas around $3 per MMBtu, the typical North American producer earns approximately 50% cash margin on incremental production. The take away here is not all commodities are created equally, and we occupy a very advantaged position within the nitrogen industry. 
Current industry conditions are at the level that we believe is unsustainable over the medium-term. Pricing is below cash cost for a significant amount of total global production, and industry profitability in many regions is too low to support normal maintenance and turnaround activity let alone equity returns and certainly well below that's required investments for new capacity. 
This situation is leading to curtailment or permanent closure of high-cost production. China alone has announced closure of over 4 million tons of urea since the first quarter and over 7.5 million tons year-to-date, with utilization rates currently around 60%. 
Similarly, producers in countries with relatively high cost, such as Lithuania, Hungary and the Ukraine have utilization rates under 60% as well. The net result is that although we expect difficult industry pricing conditions to persist through next year, the lack of meaningful new construction activity after 2017, coupled with expected capacity closures, is expected to lead to price recovery beginning in 2018. 
Against this backdrop, CF's long-term strategy remains unchanged, which is to focus on operational excellence by being the safe, efficient, reliable operator of our assets, while maximizing returns by leveraging our world-leading production distribution network.  Grow our cash flow per share by delivering accretive initiatives with returns well above our cost of capital and maintain investment grade ratings and a strong balanced sheet after which, excess cash is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Our plan over the next 18 months is consistent with our long-standing strategy and addresses the current challenging industry environment. Specifically, we will complete and start up our major expansion projects at Donaldsonville in Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have fired up the reformer and expect ammonia production to begin during this quarter. 
At Port Neal, off sites and utilities are complete and operational, and ammonia production is expected to begin late third quarter or early fourth quarter with the urea plant to follow closely thereafter.
We will reduce annual CapEx to less than $450 million starting next year. This level of spend allows for continued safe, reliable and compliant operations, while reducing discretionary spending and conserving cash. We will reduce our controllable expenses and we'll maintain a strong balanced sheet by preserving cash. To do this, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we'll be in a position to deliver in 2018 when $800 million of debt matures.
Now, let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis, who will discuss our performance for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Bert?"

A lowe",1188,"Thanks, Tony. Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales outlook for the quarter as it demonstrates the active role we take in responding the shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. A lower pricing environment of the second quarter were driven global oversupply with an excess of tons targeted to the U.S. despite NOLA and Tampa trading below international parity. 
In North America, the quarter began with solid demand at the beginning of April that helped to support selling prices. The strong run we witnessed in March for ammonium applications resulted in a portion of seasonal demand being pulled forward into the first quarter, which had a negative impact on the volume of second quarter ammonia shipments. 
The positive pricing position during the first quarter lasted  for approximately 3 weeks into the second quarter after which, pricing moved steadily lower for all products.
In early April, there was a tale of 2 Corn Belts in U.S. with Western farms planting on time, while the Eastern States were hampered by several weeks of wet and cold weather that delayed fertilizer applications in the middle of the season. This delays allows wholesalers and traders a window to import additional product and supply eventually exceeded demand. 
As a result, pricing fell throughout the quarter and hit levels that did not appear to make economic sense. By the middle of the quarter, wholesale liquidation took place, pushing prices even lower with importers struggling to generate cash positive returns.
The combination of additional imported product and subsequent liquidation pressured the urea barge market down below $200 per short ton FOB NOLA by early May. By the end of the quarter, the NOLA value for urea had fallen to just below $175 a short ton. 
Against this backdrop, the company's realized price for urea during the second quarter was $247 per short ton, a significant premium to prices reported at the U.S. Gulf. 
CF also responded to changing conditions by actively leveraging our scale, efficiency and expertise in distribution, targeting new alternative destinations and logistical options. Our fleet over 5,500 railcars and 32 barges is complemented by over 2.5 million tons of North American storage and access to both the new Star and Magellan ammonia pipelines. 
The recent completion of our urea injection terminal at Garner, Iowa affords us new flexibility in how we move ammonia throughout the pipeline. By gaining the ability to reinject ammonia at this site, it allows our teams to instantaneously transport products from the Western Corn Belt to the Eastern Corn Belt, which is a tremendous benefit to have as Port Neal comes on later this year. 
In rail, we are identifying new approaches in how we can better transport additional volume. In the prior year, our teams did not have a single unit train departed Donaldsonville site. In 2016, however, we have loaded 19 unit trains to date. For those who may not be familiar with shipping, unit trains become increasingly economical as the volume transport increases and with the capacity expansion projects coming online, we have leveraged that additional volume to our benefit.
Additionally, the recent draft with the Service Transportation Board's language on competitor switching are encouraging and present additional opportunities to streamline rail distribution routes and reduce costs. 
Our team also responded to changes in the domestic fertilizer business through our ability to switch production quickly and safely from one product to another. As I described earlier, imports continue to pressure NOLA urea prices late in the quarter. However, during this time, UAM was trading at a premium to urea on a nitrogen equivalent basis. We responded this opportunity by pivoting our capacity to maximize our UAN production at the expense of urea. As a result, we're able to better capture the nutrient basis differential that was priced into the market at that time. 
This up to improve our average price per ton for UAN, which is $202 per short ton for the second quarter of 2016. Many of our investors have heard us describe this capability that's built into our system before, and the second quarter was a prime example of our production and distribution flexibility and action. 
In aggregate, the combined result of an increased focus on system-wide maximization with healthy price realizations across the 3 major products, ammonia, urea and UAN. They were notably higher when compared to the reference published prices at NOLA and Tampa. We believe the  2016 denotes the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, and we do not expect any new capacity to be added to the global system beyond 2017 and into the foreseeable future. 
As we said many times, farmers must apply nitrogen every year to feed the world. As such, global demand for nitrogen continues to grow at an approximate rate of between 1.5% and 2.5% per year, or the [indiscernible] at 2.7 million to 4.6 million metric tons of gross urea capacity. While this continued demand growth will absorb excess supply in the coming years, as Tony said, we see tangible evidence today that suggest that additional rationalization should continue to occur throughout the global system. 
In the current pricing environment, estimates indicate that despite the decrease in the cost curve, many global nitrogen producers are estimated to be operating at or near their variable costs. The result thus far has been more than 8 million short tons of globally urea capacity that has been shut down in 2016 with the vast majority of that capacity located in China. 
The steady decrease in Chinese operating rates to the lowest point in more than 4 years support this observation. Compared to decreased domestic pricing, Chinese producers have historically looked to the export market. However, the trailing 12-month average of their exports have declined steadily since its peak in July of 2015 and prices globally were notably higher than they are today. 
Accordingly, Chinese exports are expected to reach full year volume of approximately 9 million to 10 million metric tons in 2016 compared to more than 14 million metric tons exported in 2015. 
Domestic prices in China are down approximately 30% year-over-year and at a price of $195 per metric ton FOB China for an export, we estimate that up to half of the urea industry in China is unprofitable. 
Moving on to the North American natural gas market. April Henry Hub prices cash prices began the second quarter below $2 per MMBtu, aided by a warmer normal first quarter. Cash prices traded as well as  $1.71 per MMBtu in mid--April, primarily due to a healthy storage balance and reduced demand coming out of winter. After any of withdrawal season with nearly 2.5 Tcf  in storage, strong demand and production declines contributed to a slower-than-normal start to the injection season. Throughout the quarter, natural gas prices have trended upward with smaller-than-average storage injections and forecast for a warm summer contributing to the increases. 
On June 30, natural gas traded at $2.93 in the cash market, an increase of $1.22 per MMBtu from the quarter ago. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20. Included in these results were, on a pretax basis, approximately $211 million in unrealized net mark-to-market gains on our natural gas derivatives; $165 million in transaction cost, mainly comprised of the termination fee of $150 million paid to OCI; $38 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $19 million expansion cost for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities. 
When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $342 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.33.
Included in these results is a realized loss of $61 million or $0.75 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the company did that enter into an additional natural gas hedges. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $690 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior tax years associated with the bonus depreciation provision of the [indiscernible] half. The amount of this refund is dependent upon the timing and completion for certain capital projects. 
As of June 30 2016, our prepaid income taxes were $855 million, including approximately the $690 million related to the carryback of these U.S. tax losses.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 53.2% and was impacted by the following items: first, we recaptured the manufacturing profits deduction we took in 2014 when we decide to carryback current tax losses to that year; second, we established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax asset related to our foreign operations. These were partially offset by the deduction of previously capitalized OCI transaction cost. The net effect of these 3 items is about a 20% increase in our tax rate. Excluding these items, our tax rate for the second quarter would have been closer to the statutory rate of 35%. Interest expense for the second quarter was $61 million and include the following: $76 million in interest on our outstanding debt plus $32 million in amortization of loan fees, which is included amounts related to the terminated bridge Alona associated with the OCI transaction less $47 million in capitalizing interest. 
The first distribution from CF nitrogen to CHS under our strategic venture with them occurred on August 1, 2016, for $75 million. This total is comprised of approximately $30 million related to the partial first quarter of 2016 during which, the strategic venture commenced and approximately  $45 million related to the second quarter of 2016. 
If you recall, each quarter, we recognize a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which for the first quarter was $17 million and for the second quarter was $23 million. 
However, the cash distribution payables to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period based on the terms of our agreement, which in effect, provide producer economics to CHS. 
For 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, of which, $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $450 million to $500 million for sustaining improvement and other projects. The increase I project spend is mainly related to labor productivity issues with third party contractors. 
For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. This will focus on sustaining capital to ensure our plants and facilities operate in a safe, compliant and reliable fashion. As Tony mentioned, we are reducing capital expenditures, sustaining a strong liquidity position and maintaining and defending our investment grade credit ratings. 
On July 29, 2016, the company amended its senior unsecured revolving credit agreement to reduce the size of the facility from $2 billion back to the $1.5 billion in place prior to the announcement of the OCI transaction and to increase the maximum total net leverage covenant from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. 
We have provided a scheduled in the press release that goes over the details. This will provide us with additional liquidity and flexibility should we need it. 
We're also in the process of seeking a similar amendment to mark private placement of note holders. As of June 30, 2016, we were well in compliance with all covenants and indebtedness. 
The amendment we have made to our revolver and the amendment we are seeking to make to our private placement notes reflect the prudent and proactive manner in which we manage our capital structure. Additionally, we have been making reductions in our controllable caused by managing down activity and M&A and Information Technology, along with a reduction in third party plant level contractor expenses. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

We have been following and talking with our retailer and customer friends and realized that the desire to take on additional product late in Q2 was just not there. And we have the capability to manage our system, like I said early in my prepared remarks, with different production levels of the plants as well as inventory in exports, and that's what we did. And so we ended up launching the program late in July when normally it's been a June launch, and it afforded us an opportunity to participate more in the end market tail end of the application season in a higher net back position was the result. But it also allowed our customers not to take maybe a month to 1.5 months of additional product into their inventory when they weren't prepared to do so. So looking at this year and where we are on volume for the full program, our program at first was a receivable Cooley, our prices broadly were higher than what the market had anticipated. But as we've rolled it out and had conversations with our customers, it has been received better and we had it taken on orders and we're already shipping against some of those. And so what we looked towards the program was not designed to be as big as it had been in the past. We expect that there will be an improved market, and we want to participate in that market as we roll forward. And so we have taken on an acceptable amount of volume and we will continue to do so as we go. And regarding the competitors and other people, I think there were some competitors who just weren't able to wait as long as we did or they maybe saw a different market than we did and probably received a lower net back to we are. And some of that is also driven by imports. There are imports that come into this market where it continue to be an improved market and I think we'll be into the for all of the end products, and I think some of the other producers outside of the United States decided to target some of their shipments probably at lower prices. And so we'll see that, the end values mature. You'll see those come into closer to their historical range and the market will move forward."

As we think about kind of aggregate price over the year with all the new capacity coming on and until you see some significant shutdowns and allow that new capacity the absorbed based on underlying demand growth, we think that continues to put a sort of a ceiling on where pricing trades for the products over the next 18 months. Now the things that can change that are if we see more rationalization sooner relative to the production base that's out there, you'll start seeing recovery more quickly. Or if you start seeing some more historical delta in terms of energy prices around the globe that are reintroduced, that can also kind of accelerate the rate of price recovery. But I think our view is at the end of the day, kind of given the status quo assumption about ocean freight and where energy prices are trading, with the net amount of new production that's still coming online over the next 18 months, it's going to be tough sliding here for a number of competitors. We don't see really a catalyst driving prices that we are."

And I anticipate that, that type of spread will continue as we see retailer activity on resisting taking inventory, that opportunity to expand it even further the price spread happens. And so what you see us doing is managing our production, managing our exports, managing our distribution assets, working our customers we have contractile commitments as well as spot commitments to make sure that we're producing at a high level moving our product and anticipating some of these swings and capturing some of those. So I do -- I don't think you can strip out the lows and then factor those in for 1.5 years because I do think it's going to be a dynamic market. But as we steadily move into it, and as Tony mentioned, some of these catalysts that are driving some of these changes currency, freight, gas, petroleum and an overall demand, which we see increasing, I think they'll improve over time.

I mean, it's moved by a couple hundred thousand tons here and there, but has not been a dramatic swing one direction or another. And even with all the new capacity coming online in North America, we will still be a substantial net importer of nitrogen. We'll need about 30% of our total nitrogen requirements to be met from the imports. And North American producers are among the lowest cost producers globally. So anyone that's got assets that are producing here in North America are going to run those plants flat out. And if there is trending to be down on the global scene from a production standpoint, it's going to be in the high-cost regions. So it will be the Chinese and people will continue to shut down some of the high cost. eastern European gas countries, like as we mentioned, Ukraine, Lithuania, Hungary, and so forth. And then there are other regions where there's either sort of gas availability problems and you see curtailment like in Trinidad, for example, or in other regions where there's political stability likely Libya for example where you'll also see some production coming off line. So as we look forward, one of the reasons we believe that pricing continues to be under pressure next year is the fact that there is this new capacity that you talked about coming online, but we don't really believe it's fundamentally going to move pricing dramatically lower than where it sits today because we already think that there's a number of -- a substantial volume of capacity as already operating below cash cost. So it really can't go substantially lower than where we are, and it's certainly not going to affect the operating rates of North American producers."

We think over time, it's about $3 or $4 to get any sort of reasonable capital recovery on LNG contracts. And so if you say Henry Hub trades at kind of $3, that means LNG importing regions should trade somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 or maybe a little bit above by the time you re-gas and distribute from there into the production plant.

Changes around a little bit the sort of the application, intensity away from the fall and into spring and over course of the spring. Just one big dump. But one of the benefits of the targeted precision is higher crop densities. And so if you're going to get the same kind if yield with identity, you actually need to get an increase of nitrogen application per acre in order to accomplish anything at the grower level. So we do see those trends kind of moving in a direction that is, I would say, net debt positive for us over the long run. It might change the form a little bit on the timing of when that happens from fall more into the spring, but that's one of the benefits that Bert talked about with our extensive flexible distribution network that we're willing to inventory product and kind of take that risk off of the hands of the retailer and then capitalize when the opportunity when the application season does come. So for us, we look at all of those trends as being kind of a net positive for our business."

If you look at the base model of China, we have unsustainable coal prices, unsustainable logistics, unsustainable issues in terms of pollution and just areas surrounding what's being produced and exported. And so they are going to have to rationalize. When we see that taking place with 8 million tons coming off and we expect additional rationalization and the pricing remains at its current level, possibly permanent shutdowns. The export tariff is about $12 per ton. So today, and this numbers has been moving, the Chinese urea is quoted in the $195 to $200 range FOB for granular. And so you cut that price down to let say, $185, you're still one quality is poor or less -- it's not received as well as our products or some of the products coming out of the Gulf. And so is that enough for them to compete? I don't think $12 is going to get them over the hump to allow them to compete on a consistent basis for the current market. So we expect to see they need to have rationalization. Their domestic industry cannot support the total capacity they have. So like Tony said, they are operating in the 60% to 65% operating rate and their exports are trending down. All of those are trends that in the lowest cost probably the position that they will have again called in low currency around 6 65. And so the only thing probably going forward, I'd say moderating is moderating up on all those issues. So you can get $12 on your expert, you're probably not going to lose that to raw material costs and freight cost over time."

Looking at how farmers should be looking at nutrients for fall applications and even spring applications. Yes corn is down at, let's say, $3.40 for a forward harvest position of corn.

So I think you'll see us continuing to grow those opportunities, but it is weighted against, obviously, net back options and what's best for the company.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, in which we generated EBITDA of $329 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million after taking into account unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains, costs related to determination of the OCI transaction, net foreign currency losses on intercompany loans and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.
Included in these results, and not adjusted for, is a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $61 million. 
For the first half 2016, EBITDA was $536 million, while adjusted EBITDA was $642 million after taking into account the same factors as for the second quarter. The first half results included realized loss on natural gas hedges of $117 million, which was not adjusted for. 
So even with the challenging conditions in the global fertilizer market, our underlying business performance remained strong. 
Before turning the call over to Bert and Dennis to give details on the quarter, I want to provide some observations and thoughts about the nitrogen market and our response to current industry conditions. There are some industry elements that are more structural and permanent in nature, while others tend to be more temporal. Fortunately, the elements that are structural tend to be strengths and benefit CF. These include the global nitrogen demand continues to grow at roughly 2% per year, so there is strength underpinning our industry. Natural gas represents about 2/3 to 3/4 of the cash cost of producing nitrogen, and North America has a long-term natural gas cost advantage.
North America is one of the largest nitrogen consumption regions, where demand far exceeds domestic supply and, therefore, is heavily dependent upon imported products. 
CF is the world's low-cost nitrogen leader with the largest North American interior production and distribution system. CF's nutrient ton production will increase by more than 25% in the next few months, and as a result, CF has the enviable position of being structurally advantaged and one of the most profitable nitrogen manufacturers in the world, with significant growth imminent. 
However, the industry is under pressure, facing several significant challenges. Fortunately, these issues tend to be more transitory in nature and include the nitrogen industry as in a state of significant overcapacity, with additional new capacity yet to still come on stream through 2017. However, there is little-to-no new capacity additions currently in flight beyond 2017, and with underlying demand growth in nitrogen, the global supply-demand balance should start to resolve beginning in 2018. 
The combination of excess nitrogen capacity with lower global energy costs, coupled with devaluation of certain key currencies and assisted by low transoceanic freight, have led to the dramatic fall in nitrogen product prices. We expect this situation to persist in the near term, with prices under continued pressure for 2017.
However, even in these conditions, CF enjoys greater than 30% gross margins. I want to pause for a moment and reemphasize this last point. We operate in a commodity business, and even in the face of significant industry overcapacity, with prices that have cratered, CF Industries was able to deliver first half 2016 gross margin of 35%. How was that possible in a commodity industry, you might ask. The answer is that although the global cost curve has widened with new capacity additions and has flattened because of lower global energy costs, it is certainly not flat, far from it. 
North America producers still enjoy a very significant advantage. With our realized price of urea at roughly $250 per ton in the second quarter, and with gas around $3 per MMBtu, the typical North American producer earns approximately 50% cash margin on incremental production. The takeaway here is that not all commodities are created equally, and we occupy a very advantaged position within the nitrogen industry. 
Current industry conditions are at a level that we believe is unsustainable over the medium term. Pricing is below cash cost for a significant amount of total global production, and industry profitability in many regions is too low to support normal maintenance and turnaround activity, let alone equity returns, and certainly well below that required for investments in new capacity. 
This situation is leading to curtailment or permanent closure of high-cost production. China alone has announced closure of over 4 million tons of urea since the first quarter and over 7.5 million tons year-to-date, with utilization rates currently around 60%. 
Similarly, producers in countries with relatively high costs, such as Lithuania, Hungary and Ukraine, have utilization rates under 60% as well. The net result is that although we expect difficult industry pricing conditions to persist through next year, the lack of meaningful new construction activity after 2017, coupled with expected capacity closures, is expected to lead to price recovery beginning in 2018. 
Against this backdrop, CF's long-term strategy remains unchanged, which is to focus on operational excellence by being the safe, efficient, reliable operator of our assets, while maximizing returns by leveraging our world-beating production and distribution network; grow our cash flow per share by delivering accretive initiatives, with returns well above our cost to capital; and maintain investment grade ratings and a strong balance sheet, after which excess cash is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Our plan over the next 18 months is consistent with our long-standing strategy and addresses the current challenging industry environment. Specifically, we will complete and start up our major expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have fired up the reformer and expect ammonia production to begin during this quarter. 
At Port Neal, off-sites and utilities are complete and operational, and ammonia production is expected to begin late third quarter or early fourth quarter, with the urea plant to follow closely thereafter.
We will reduce annual CapEx to less than $450 million starting next year. This level of spend allows for continued safe, reliable and compliant operations, while reducing discretionary spending and conserving cash. We will reduce our controllable expenses and we'll maintain a strong balance sheet by preserving cash. To do this, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will be in a position to delever in 2018, when $800 million of debt matures.
Now let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis, who will discuss our performance for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Bert?"

Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as it demonstrates the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The l",1191,"Thanks, Tony. Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as it demonstrates the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The lower pricing environment of the second quarter was driven by global oversupply, with an excess of tons targeted to the U.S., despite NOLA and Tampa trading below international parity. 
In North America, the quarter began with solid demand at the beginning of April that helped to support selling prices. The strong run we witnessed in March for ammonium applications resulted in a portion of seasonal demand being pulled forward into the first quarter, which had a negative impact on the volume of second quarter ammonia shipments. 
The positive pricing position during the first quarter lasted  for approximately 3 weeks into the second quarter, after which pricing moved steadily lower for all products.
In early April, there was a tale of 2 Corn Belts in the U.S., with Western farms planting on time, while the Eastern states were hampered by several weeks of wet and cold weather that delayed fertilizer applications in the middle of the season. This delay allowed wholesalers and traders a window to import additional product and supply eventually exceeded demand. 
As a result, pricing fell throughout the quarter and hit levels that did not appear to make economic sense. By the middle of the quarter, wholesale liquidation took place, pushing prices even lower with importers struggling to generate cash-positive returns.
The combination of additional imported product and subsequent liquidation pressured the urea barge market down below $200 per short ton FOB NOLA by early May. By the end of the quarter, the NOLA value for urea had fallen to just below $175 a short ton. 
Against this backdrop, the company's realized price for urea during the second quarter was $247 per short ton, a significant premium to prices reported at the U.S. Gulf. 
CF also responded to changing conditions by actively leveraging our scale, efficiency and expertise in distribution, targeting new alternative destinations and logistical options. Our fleet of over 5,500 railcars and 32 barges is complemented by over 2.5 million tons of North American storage and access to both the NuStar and Magellan ammonia pipelines. 
The recent completion of our reinjection terminal at Garner, Iowa, affords us new flexibility in how we move ammonia throughout the pipeline. By gaining the ability to reinject ammonia at this site, it allows our teams to instantaneously transport product from the Western Corn Belt to the Eastern Corn Belt, which is a tremendous benefit to have as Port Neal comes on later this year. 
In rail, we are identifying new approaches in how we can better transport additional volume. In the prior year, our teams did not have a single unit train depart at the Donaldsonville site. In 2016, however, we have loaded 19 unit trains to date. For those who may not be familiar with shipping, unit trains become increasingly economical as the volume transported increases, and with the capacity expansion projects coming online, we have leveraged that additional volume to our benefit.
Additionally, the recent drafts of the Service Transportation Board's language on competitor switching are encouraging and present additional opportunities to streamline rail distribution routes and reduce costs. 
Our team also responded to changes in the domestic fertilizer business through our ability to switch production quickly and safely from one product to another. As I described earlier, imports continue to pressure NOLA urea prices late in the quarter. However, during this time, UAN was trading at a premium to urea on a nitrogen equivalent basis. We responded this opportunity by pivoting our capacity to maximize our UAN production at the expense of urea. As a result, we're able to better capture the nutrient basis differential that was priced into the market at that time. This helped to improve our average price per ton for UAN, which was $202 per short ton for the second quarter of 2016. Many of our investors have heard us describe this capability that's built into our system before, and the second quarter was a prime example of our production and distribution flexibility and action. 
In aggregate, the combined result of an increased focus on system-wide maximization with healthy price realizations across the 3 major products: ammonia, urea and UAN. They were notably higher when compared to the referenced published prices at NOLA and Tampa. We believe the  2016 denotes the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, and we do not expect any new capacity to be added to the global system beyond 2017 and into the foreseeable future. 
As we have said many times, farmers must apply nitrogen every year to feed the world. As such, global demand for nitrogen continues to grow at an approximate rate of between 1.5% and 2.5% per year, or the equivalent of 2.7 to 4.6 million metric tons of gross urea capacity. While this continued demand growth will absorb excess supply in the coming years, as Tony said, we see tangible evidence today that suggests that additional rationalization should continue to occur throughout the global system. 
In the current pricing environment, estimates indicate that despite the decrease in the cost curve, many global nitrogen producers are estimated to be operating at or near their variable costs. The result thus far has been more than 8 million short tons of globally urea capacity that has been shut down in 2016, with the vast majority of that capacity located in China. 
A steady decrease in Chinese operating rates to the lowest point in more than 4 years supports this observation. In periods of decreased domestic pricing, Chinese producers have historically looked to the export market. However, the trailing 12-month average of their exports has declined steadily since its peak in July of 2015, when prices globally were notably higher than they are today. 
Accordingly, Chinese exports are expected to reach full year volume of approximately 9 to 10 million metric tons in 2016 compared to more than 14 million metric tons exported in 2015. 
Domestic prices in China are down approximately 30% year-over-year and at a price of $195 per metric ton FOB China for export, we estimate that up to half of the urea industry in China is unprofitable. 
Moving on to the North American natural gas market. April Henry Hub prices -- cash prices began this second quarter below $2 per MMBtu, aided by a warmer than normal first quarter. Cash prices traded as low as $1.71 per MMBtu in mid-April, primarily due to a healthy storage balance and reduced demand coming out of winter. After ending the withdrawal season with nearly 2.5 Tcf  in storage, strong demand and production declines contributed to a slower-than-normal start to the injection season. Throughout the quarter, natural gas prices have trended upward, with smaller-than-average storage injections and forecast for a warm summer contributing to the increases. 
On June 30, natural gas traded at $2.93 in the cash market, an increase of $1.22 per MMBtu from the quarter low. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20.

In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20. Included in these results were, on a pretax basis, approximately $211 million in unrealized net mark-to-market gains on our natural gas derivatives; $165 million in transaction costs, mainly comprising of the termination fee of $150 million paid to OCI; $38 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $19 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities. 
When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $342 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.33.
Included in these results is a realized loss of $61 million or $0.75 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $690 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior tax years associated with the bonus depreciation provision of the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent upon the timing and completion for certain capital projects. 
As of June 30 2016, our prepaid income taxes were $855 million, including approximately the $690 million related to the carryback of these U.S. tax losses.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 53.2% and was impacted by the following items: first, we recaptured the manufacturing profits deduction we took in 2014, when we decided to carryback current tax losses to that year; second, we established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets related to our foreign operations. These were partially offset by the deduction of previously capitalized OCI transaction costs. The net effect of these 3 items is about a 20% increase in our tax rate. Excluding these items, our tax rate for the second quarter would have been closer to the statutory rate of 35%. Interest expense for the second quarter was $61 million and include the following: $76 million in interest on our outstanding debt plus $32 million in amortization of loan fees, which included amounts related to the terminated bridge loan associated with the OCI transaction, less $47 million in capitalizing interest. 
The first distribution from CF nitrogen to CHS under our strategic venture with them occurred on August 1, 2016, for $75 million. This total is comprised of approximately $30 million related to the partial first quarter of 2016, during which the strategic venture commenced and approximately $45 million related to the second quarter of 2016. 
If you recall, each quarter, we recognized a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which for the first quarter was $17 million and for the second quarter was $23 million. 
However, the cash distribution payable semiannually to CHS, may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period, based on the terms of our agreement, which in effect provide producer economics to CHS. 
For 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, of which, $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $450 million to $500 million for sustaining improvement and other projects. The increase in project spend is mainly related to labor productivity issues with third party contractors. 
For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. This will focus on sustaining capital to ensure our plants and facilities operate in a safe, compliant and reliable fashion. As Tony mentioned, we are reducing discretionary capital expenditures, sustaining a strong liquidity position and maintaining and defending our investment grade credit ratings. 
On July 29, 2016, the company amended its senior unsecured revolving credit agreement to reduce the size of the facility from $2 billion back to the $1.5 billion in place prior to the announcement of the OCI transaction and to increase the maximum total net leverage covenant from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. 
We have provided a schedule in the press release that goes over the details. This will provide us with additional liquidity and flexibility should we need it. 
We're also in the process of seeking a similar amendment to mark private placement note holders. As of June 30, 2016, we were well in compliance with all covenants and our indebtedness. 
The amendment we have made to our revolver and the amendment we are seeking to make to our private placement notes reflect the prudent and proactive manner in which we manage our capital structure. Additionally, we have been making reductions in our controllable costs by managing down activity in M&A and Information Technology, along with a reduction in third party plant level contractor expenses. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

We have been following and talking with our retailer and customer friends and realized that the desire to take on additional product late in Q2 was just not there. And we have the capability to manage our system, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, with different production levels of the plants as well as inventory in exports, and that's what we did. And so we ended up launching the program late in July when normally it's been a June launch. And that afforded us the opportunity to participate more in the end market tail end of the application season and a higher netback position was the result. But it also allowed our customers not to take maybe a month to 1.5 months of additional products into their inventory when they weren't prepared to do so. So looking at this year and where we are on volume for the fill program, our program at first was Receivable Cooley [ph], our prices probably were higher than what the market had anticipated. But as we've rolled it out and had conversations with our customers, it has been received better, and we have been taking on orders, and we're already shipping against some of those. And so what we looked towards the program was not designed to be as big as it had been in the past. We expect that there will be an improved market, and we want to participate in that market as we roll forward. And so we have taken on an acceptable amount of volume, and we will continue to do so as we go. Regarding the competitors and other people, I think there were some competitors, who just weren't able to wait as long as we did or they maybe saw a different market than we did and probably received a lower netback than we are. And some of that is also driven by imports. There are imports that come into this market, where it'll continue to be an import market and I think will be into the foreseeable future for all of the end products, and I think some of the other producers outside of United States decided to target some of their shipments probably at lower prices. And so we'll see that as the end values mature. You'll see those come back closer to their historical range and the market will move forward."

As we think about kind of aggregate price over the year with all the new capacity coming on and until you see some significant shutdowns and allow that new capacity to be absorbed based on underlying demand growth, we think that continues to put a sort of a ceiling on where pricing trades for the products over the next 18 months. Now the things that can change that are if we see more rationalization sooner relative to the production base that's out there, you'll start seeing recovery more quickly. Or if you start seeing some more historical delta in terms of energy prices around the globe that are reintroduced, that can also kind of accelerate the rate of price recovery. But I think our view is at the end of the day, kind of given the status quo assumption about ocean freight and where energy prices are trading, with the net amount of new production that's still coming online over the next 18 months, it's going to be tough sliding here for a number of competitors.

I mean, it's moved by a couple hundred thousand tons here and there, but has not been a dramatic swing one direction or another. And even with all the new capacity coming online in North America, we will still be a substantial net importer of nitrogen. We'll need about 30% of our total nitrogen requirement to be met from the imports. And North American producers are among the lowest cost producers globally. So anyone that's got assets that are producing here in North America are going to run those plants flat out. And if there is trending to be done on the global scene from a production standpoint, it's going to be in the high-cost regions. So it'll be -- the Chinese, the anthracite people will continue to shut down, some of the high costs eastern European gas countries, like, as we mentioned, Ukraine, Lithuania, Hungary and so forth. And then there are other regions where there's either sort of gas availability problems and you see curtailment like in Trinidad, for example, or in other regions where there's political instability like Libya, for example, where you'll also see some production coming off line. So as we look forward, one of the reasons we believe that pricing continues to be under pressure next year is the fact that there is this new capacity that you talked about coming online, but we don't really believe it's fundamentally going to move pricing dramatically lower than where it sits today, because we already think that there's a number of -- a substantial volume of capacity is already operating below cash cost. So it really can't go substantially lower than where we are, and it's certainly not going to affect the operating rates of North American producers."

I mean, as we look at the factors, Matthew, that could affect that, one of the big ones is just where Russia Gazprom prices, their exports to places like the Ukraine and so forth. There's another one that is kind of how LNG continues to evolve and how much of the new production ends up moving off of kind of oil link-based contracts more on to a spot basis. We think over time it's about $3 or $4 to get any sort of reasonable capital recovery on LNG contracts. And so if you say henry Hub trades at kind of $3, that means LNG importing regions should trade somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 or maybe a little bit above by the time you re-gas and distribute from there into production plants. So as we look forward, our view is we're likely to be able to do away, call it, $4 plus or minus advantage over most of the rest of the kind of the importing or gas-deficient regions."

They're not putting the kind of money into the deep water and the Arctic and these more country regions that they used to be in terms of exploration development. In addition to that, we've also seen development activity in North America with respect to Anch [ph] oil production come off as well. So eventually, the problem solves itself. The stuff that sounds continues to decline. The declines don't get replaced with new projects. And eventually, the oil market straightens out. The question is how far off are we from that happening?

But one of the benefits of the targeted precision ag is higher crop densities. And so if you're going to get the same kind if yield with higher density, you actually need to get an increase of nitrogen application per acre in order to accomplish anything at the grower level. So we do see those trends kind of moving in a direction, that is, I would say, net-net positive for us over the long run. It might change the form a little bit over the the timing of when that happens from the fall more into the spring, but that's one of the benefits that Bert talked about with our extensive flexible distribution network that we're willing to inventory product and kind of take that risk off of the hands of the retailer and then capitalize on the opportunity when the application season does come.

If you look at the base model of China, we have unsustainable coal prices, unsustainable logistics, unsustainable issues in terms of pollution and just areas surrounding what's being produced and exported. And so they are going to have to rationalize, and we see that taking place with 8 million tons coming off. And we expect additional rationalization, and if pricing remains at its current level, possibly permanent shutdowns. The export tariff is about $12 per ton. So if today and this number has been moving, but Chinese urea is quoted in the $195 to $200 range FOB for granular. And so you cut that price down to, let's say, $185, you're still -- one, quality is poor or less -- it's not received as well as our products or some of the products coming out of the Europe Gulf. And so is that enough for them to compete? I don't think $12 is going to get them over the hump to allow them to compete on a consistent basis at the current market. So we expect to see -- they need to have rationalization. Their domestic industry cannot support the total capacity they have. So like Tony said, they're operating in the 60% to 65% operating rate and their exports are trending down. All those are trends that in the lowest cost probability position that they will have with, again, coal being low, currency around 6 65 [ph] . And so the only thing probably going forward, I'd say, moderating is moderating up on all those issues.

So prices are slowly moving up. I think that's in recognition of when you look at the UAN and urea comparison. Both those products are trading at a very good value. Anyway, actually moving forward with maybe another question, looking at how farmers should be looking at nutrients for fall applications and even spring applications, yes, corn is down at, let's say, $3.40 for a forward harvest position of corn.

We would expect to run the urea plant absolutely full out with the excess being some incremental anhydrous that shows up in Port Neal. But generally speaking, we're going to want to run that urea plant flat out, and there isn't a lot of ability to move the mix in Port Neal. There's a couple hundred thousand tons that we can flex back and forth between urea and UAN, but generally speaking, the new plants are just going to come on and kind of run at capacity."

And we're excited about the opportunities in South America because we do believe in the benefits of UAN and that's being received well, and so the growth is there. So I think you'll see us continue to grow those opportunities, but it is weighted against, obviously, netback options and what's best for the company. And so I think urea will grow as we bring the capacity online. If we have a differential again like we've had in -- for 6 months of this year, the U.S. traded at discount to the international market, then we have a pretty good incentive to export the products out of United States.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, in which we generated EBITDA of $329 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million after taking into account unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains, costs related to the termination of the OCI transaction, net foreign currency losses on intercompany loans, and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.
Included in these results, and not adjusted for, is a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $61 million. 
For the first half 2016, EBITDA was $536 million while adjusted EBITDA was $642 million after taking into account the same factors as for the second quarter. The first half results included realized loss on natural gas hedges of $117 million, which was not adjusted for. 
So even with the challenging conditions in the global fertilizer market, our underlying business performance remained strong. 
Before turning the call over to Bert and Dennis to give details on the quarter, I want to provide some observations and thoughts about the nitrogen market and our response to current industry conditions. There are some industry elements that are more structural and permanent in nature, while others tend to be more temporal. Fortunately, the elements that are structural tend to be strengths and benefit CF. These include: the global nitrogen demand continues to grow at roughly 2% per year, so there is strength underpinning our industry; natural gas represents about 2/3 to 3/4 of the cash cost of producing nitrogen, and North America has a long-term natural gas cost advantage; North America is one of the largest nitrogen consumption regions, where demand far exceeds domestic supply and, therefore, is heavily dependent upon imported products. 
CF is the world's low-cost nitrogen leader with the largest North American interior production and distribution system. CF's nutrient ton production will increase by more than 25% in the next few months, and as a result, CF has the enviable position of being structurally advantaged and one of the most profitable nitrogen manufacturers in the world, with significant growth imminent. 
However, the industry is under pressure, facing several significant challenges. Fortunately, these issues tend to be more transitory in nature and include: the nitrogen industry is in a state of significant overcapacity, with additional new capacity yet to still come on stream through 2017. However, there is little to no new capacity additions currently in flight beyond 2017, and with underlying demand growth in nitrogen, the global supply-demand balance should start to resolve beginning in 2018. 
The combination of excess nitrogen capacity with lower global energy costs, coupled with devaluation of certain key currencies and assisted by low transoceanic freight, have led to the dramatic fall in nitrogen product prices. We expect this situation to persist in the near term, with prices under continued pressure for 2017.
However, even in these conditions, CF enjoys greater than 30% gross margins. I want to pause for a moment and reemphasize this last point. We operate in a commodity business, and even in the face of significant industry overcapacity, with prices that have cratered, CF Industries was able to deliver first half 2016 gross margin of 35%. How was that possible in a commodity industry, you might ask. The answer is that although the global cost curve has widened with new capacity additions and has flattened because of lower global energy costs, it is certainly not flat, far from it. 
North America producers still enjoy a very significant advantage. With our realized price of urea at roughly $250 per ton in the second quarter, and with gas around $3 per MMBtu, the typical North American producer earns approximately 50% cash margin on incremental production. The takeaway here is that not all commodities are created equally, and we occupy a very advantaged position within the nitrogen industry. 
Current industry conditions are at a level that we believe is unsustainable over the medium term. Pricing is below cash cost for a significant amount of total global production, and industry profitability in many regions is too low to support normal maintenance and turnaround activity, let alone equity returns, and certainly well below that required for investments in new capacity. 
This situation is leading to curtailment or permanent closure of high-cost production. China alone has announced closure of over 4 million tons of urea since the first quarter and over 7.5 million tons year-to-date, with utilization rates currently around 60%. 
Similarly, producers in countries with relatively high costs, such as Lithuania, Hungary and Ukraine, have utilization rates under 60% as well. The net result is that although we expect difficult industry pricing conditions to persist through next year, the lack of meaningful new construction activity after 2017, coupled with expected capacity closures, is expected to lead to price recovery beginning in 2018. 
Against this backdrop, CF's long-term strategy remains unchanged, which is to focus on operational excellence by being a safe, efficient, reliable operator of our assets, while maximizing returns by leveraging our world-leading production and distribution network; grow our cash flow per share by delivering accretive initiatives, with returns well above our cost of capital; and maintain investment-grade ratings and a strong balance sheet, after which excess cash is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Our plan over the next 18 months is consistent with our long-standing strategy and addresses the current challenging industry environment. Specifically, we will complete and start up our major expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have fired up the reformer and expect ammonia production to begin during this quarter. 
At Port Neal, off-sites and utilities are complete and operational, and ammonia production is expected to begin late third quarter or early fourth quarter, with the urea plant to follow closely thereafter.
We will reduce annual CapEx to less than $450 million starting next year. This level of spend allows for continued safe, reliable and compliant operations, while reducing discretionary spending and conserving cash. We will reduce our controllable expenses and we'll maintain a strong balance sheet by preserving cash. To do this, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will be in a position to delever in 2018, when $800 million of debt matures.
Now let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis, who will discuss our performance for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Bert?"

Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as they demonstrate the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The",1190,"Thanks, Tony. Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as they demonstrate the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The lower pricing environment of the second quarter was driven by global oversupply, with an excess of tons targeted to the U.S., despite NOLA and Tampa trading below international parity. 
In North America, the quarter began with solid demand at the beginning of April that helped to support selling prices. The strong run we witnessed in March for ammonia applications resulted in a portion of seasonal demand being pulled forward into the first quarter, which had a negative impact on the volume of second quarter ammonia shipments. 
The positive pricing position during the first quarter lasted for approximately 3 weeks into the second quarter, after which pricing moved steadily lower for all products.
In early April, there was a tale of 2 Corn Belts in the U.S., with Western farms planting on time, while the Eastern states were hampered by several weeks of wet and cold weather that delayed fertilizer applications in the middle of the season. This delay allowed wholesalers and traders a window to import additional product, and supply eventually exceeded demand. 
As a result, pricing fell throughout the quarter and hit levels that did not appear to make economic sense. By the middle of the quarter, wholesale liquidation took place, pushing prices even lower, with importers struggling to generate cash-positive returns.
The combination of additional imported product and subsequent liquidation pressured the urea barge market down below $200 per short ton FOB NOLA by early May. By the end of the quarter, the NOLA value for urea had fallen to just below $175 a short ton. 
Against this backdrop, the company's realized price for urea during the second quarter was $247 per short ton, a significant premium to prices reported at the U.S. Gulf. 
CF also responded to changing conditions by actively leveraging our scale, efficiency and expertise in distribution, targeting new alternative destinations and logistical options. Our fleet of over 5,500 railcars and 32 barges is complemented by over 2.5 million tons of North American storage and access to both the NuStar and Magellan ammonia pipelines. 
The recent completion of our reinjection terminal at Garner, Iowa, affords us new flexibility in how we move ammonia throughout the pipeline. By gaining the ability to reinject ammonia at this site, it allows our teams to instantaneously transport product from the Western Corn Belt to the Eastern Corn Belt, which is a tremendous benefit to have as Port Neal comes on later this year. 
In rail, we are identifying new approaches in how we can better transport additional volume. In the prior year, our teams did not have a single unit train depart the Donaldsonville site. In 2016, however, we have loaded 19 unit trains to date. For those who may not be familiar with shipping, unit trains become increasingly economical as the volume transported increases. And with the capacity expansion projects coming online, we have leveraged that additional volume to our benefit.
Additionally, the recent drafts of the Surface Transportation Board's language on competitive switching are encouraging and present additional opportunities to streamline rail distribution routes and reduce costs. 
Our team also responded to changes in the domestic fertilizer business through our ability to switch production quickly and safely from one product to another. As I described earlier, imports continued to pressure NOLA urea prices late in the quarter. However, during this time, UAN was trading at a premium to urea on a nitrogen-equivalent basis. We responded to this opportunity by pivoting our capacity to maximize our UAN production at the expense of urea. As a result, we're able to better capture the nutrient basis differential that was priced into the market at that time. This helped to improve our average price per ton for UAN, which was $202 per short ton for the second quarter of 2016. Many of our investors have heard us describe this capability that's built into our system before, and the second quarter was a prime example of our production and distribution flexibility and action. 
In aggregate, the combined result of an increased focus on system-wide maximization was healthy price realizations across the 3 major products: ammonia, urea and UAN, that were notably higher when compared to the referenced published prices at NOLA and Tampa. We believe that 2016 denotes the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, and we do not expect any new capacity to be added to the global system beyond 2017 and into the foreseeable future. 
As we have said many times, farmers must apply nitrogen every year to feed the world. As such, global demand for nitrogen continues to grow at an approximate rate of between 1.5% and 2.5% per year, or the equivalent of 2.7 million to 4.6 million metric tons of gross urea capacity. While this continued demand growth will absorb excess supply in the coming years, as Tony said, we see tangible evidence today that suggests that additional rationalization should continue to occur throughout the global system. 
In the current pricing environment, estimates indicate that despite the decrease in the cost curve, many global nitrogen producers are estimated to be operating at or near their variable costs. The result thus far has been more than 8 million short tons of globally urea capacity that has been shut down in 2016, with the vast majority of that capacity located in China. 
A steady decrease in Chinese operating rates to the lowest point in more than 4 years supports this observation. In periods of decreased domestic pricing, Chinese producers have historically looked to the export market. However, the trailing 12-month average of their exports has declined steadily since its peak in July of 2015, when prices globally were notably higher than they are today. 
Accordingly, Chinese exports are expected to reach full year volume of approximately 9 million to 10 million metric tons in 2016 compared to more than 14 million metric tons exported in 2015. 
Domestic prices in China are down approximately 30% year-over-year, and at a price of $195 per metric ton FOB China for export, we estimate that up to half of the urea industry in China is unprofitable. 
Moving on to the North American natural gas market. April Henry Hub prices -- cash prices began this second quarter below $2 per MMBtu, aided by a warmer-than-normal first quarter. Cash prices traded as low as $1.71 per MMBtu in mid-April, primarily due to a healthy storage balance and reduced demand coming out of winter. After ending the withdrawal season with nearly 2.5 Tcf in storage, strong demand and production declines contributed to a slower-than-normal start to the injection season. Throughout the quarter, natural gas prices have trended upward, with smaller-than-average storage injections and forecasts for a warm summer contributing to the increases. 
On June 30, natural gas traded at $2.93 in the cash market, an increase of $1.22 per MMBtu from the quarter low. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20.

In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20. Included in these results were, on a pretax basis, approximately $211 million in unrealized net mark-to-market gains on our natural gas derivatives; $165 million in transaction costs, mainly comprising of the termination fee of $150 million paid to OCI; $38 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $19 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities. 
When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $342 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.33.
Included in these results is a realized loss of $61 million or $0.75 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $690 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior tax years associated with the bonus depreciation provision of the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent upon the timing and completion for certain capital projects. 
As of June 30, 2016, our prepaid income taxes were $855 million, including approximately the $690 million related to the carryback of these U.S. tax losses.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 53.2% and was impacted by the following items: first, we recaptured the manufacturing profits deduction we took in 2014, when we decided to carryback current tax losses to that year; second, we established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets related to our foreign operations. These were partially offset by the deduction of previously capitalized OCI transaction costs. The net effect of these 3 items is about a 20% increase in our tax rate. Excluding these items, our tax rate for the second quarter would have been closer to the statutory rate of 35%. Interest expense for the second quarter was $61 million and include the following: $76 million in interest on our outstanding debt plus $32 million in amortization of loan fees, which included amounts related to the terminated bridge loan associated with the OCI transaction, less $47 million in capitalized interest. 
The first distribution from CF Nitrogen to CHS under our strategic venture with them occurred on August 1, 2016, for $75 million. This total is comprised of approximately $30 million related to the partial first quarter of 2016, during which the strategic venture commenced, and approximately $45 million related to the second quarter of 2016. 
If you recall, each quarter, we recognize a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which for the first quarter was $17 million and for the second quarter was $23 million. 
However, the cash distribution payable semiannually to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period, based on the terms of our agreements, which in effect provide producer economics to CHS. 
For 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, of which, $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $450 million to $500 million for sustaining, improvement and other projects. The increase in project spend is mainly related to labor productivity issues with third-party contractors. 
For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. This will focus on sustaining capital to ensure our plants and facilities operate in a safe, compliant and reliable fashion. As Tony mentioned, we are reducing discretionary capital expenditures, sustaining a strong liquidity position and maintaining and defending our investment-grade credit ratings. 
On July 29, 2016, the company amended its senior unsecured revolving credit agreement to reduce the size of the facility from $2 billion back to the $1.5 billion in place prior to the announcement of the OCI transaction and to increase the maximum total net leverage covenant from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. 
We have provided a schedule in the press release that goes over the details. This will provide us with additional liquidity and flexibility should we need it. 
We're also in the process of seeking a similar amendment from our private placement note holders. As of June 30, 2016, we were well in compliance with all covenants on our indebtedness. 
The amendment we have made to our revolver and the amendment we are seeking to make to our private placement notes reflect the prudent and proactive manner in which we manage our capital structure. Additionally, we have been making reductions in our controllable costs by managing down activity in M&A and information technology, along with a reduction in third-party plant level contractor expenses. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

We have been following and talking with our retailer and customer friends and realized that the desire to take on additional product late in Q2 was just not there. And we have the capability to manage our system, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, with different production levels at the plants as well as inventory and exports, and that's what we did. And so we ended up launching the program late in July, when normally it's been a June launch. And that afforded us the opportunity to participate more in the end market tail end of the application season, and a higher netback position was the result. But it also allowed our customers not to take maybe a month to 1.5 months of additional product into their inventory when they weren't prepared to do so. So looking at this year and where we are on volume for the fill program, our program at first was received a little coolly. Our prices probably were higher than what the market had anticipated. But as we've rolled it out and had conversations with our customers, it has been received better, and we have been taking on orders, and we're already shipping against some of those. And so what we look towards, the program was not designed to be as big as it had been in the past. We expect that there will be an improved market, and we want to participate in that market as we roll forward. And so we have taken on an acceptable amount of volume, and we will continue to do so as we go. Regarding the competitors and other people, I think there were some competitors who just weren't able to wait as long as we did or they maybe saw a different market than we did and probably received a lower netback than we are. And some of that is also driven by imports. There are imports that come into this market. We're going to continue to be an import market and I think will be into the foreseeable future for all of the end products, and I think some of the other producers outside of United States decided to target some of their shipments probably at lower prices. And so we'll see that as the end values mature, you'll see those come back closer to their historical range and the market will move forward."

As we think about kind of aggregate price over the year with all the new capacity coming on and until you see some significant shutdowns and allow that new capacity to be absorbed based on underlying demand growth, we think that continues to put a sort of a ceiling on where pricing trades for the products over the next 18 months. Now the things that can change that are if we see more rationalization sooner relative to the production base that's out there, you'll start seeing recovery more quickly. Or if you start seeing some more historical deltas in terms of energy prices around the globe that are reintroduced, that can also kind of accelerate the rate of price recovery. But I think our view is at the end of the day, kind of given the status quo assumption about ocean freight and where energy prices are trading, with the net amount of new production that's still coming online over the next 18 months, it's going to be tough sledding here for a number of competitors. We don't see really a catalyst driving prices substantively higher."

And I anticipate that, that type of spread will continue as we see retailer activity on resisting taking inventory, that opportunity to expand even further the price spread happens. And so what you see us doing is managing our production, managing our exports, managing our distribution assets, working with our customers, we have contractual commitments as well as spot commitments, to make sure that we're producing at a high level, moving our product and anticipating some of these swings and capturing some of those. So I do -- I don't think you can strip out the lows and then factor those in for another 1.5 years, because I do think it's going to be a dynamic market. But as we steadily move into it, and as Tony mentioned, some of these catalysts that are driving some of these changes, currency, freight, gas, petroleum and an overall demand, which we see increasing, I think they'll improve over time.

I mean, it's moved by a couple hundred thousand tons here and there, but it has not been a dramatic swing one direction or another. And even with all the new capacity coming online in North America, we will still be a substantial net importer of nitrogen. We'll need about 30% of our total nitrogen requirements to be met from imports. And North American producers are among the lowest-cost producers globally. So anyone that's got assets that are producing here in North America are going to run those plants flat out. And if there is trimming to be done on the global scene from a production standpoint, it's going to be in the high-cost regions. So it'll be -- the Chinese anthracite people will continue to shut down, some of the high-cost Eastern European gas countries, like, as we mentioned, Ukraine, Lithuania, Hungary and so forth. And then there are other regions where there's either sort of gas availability problems and you see curtailment like in Trinidad, for example, or in other regions where there's political instability like Libya, for example, where you'll also see some production coming off line. So as we look forward, one of the reasons we believe that pricing continues to be under pressure next year is the fact that there is this new capacity that you talked about coming online, but we don't really believe it's fundamentally going to move pricing dramatically lower than where it sits today, because we already think that there's a number of -- a substantial volume of capacity is already operating below cash cost. So it really can't go substantially lower than where we are, and it's certainly not going to affect the operating rates of North American producers."

There's another one that is kind of how LNG continues to evolve and how much of the new production ends up moving off of kind of oil-linked-based contracts more on to a spot basis. We think over time it's about $3 or $4 to get any sort of reasonable capital recovery on LNG contracts. And so if you say Henry Hub trades at kind of $3, that means LNG importing regions should trade somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 or maybe a little bit above by the time you re-gas and distribute from there into production plants. So as we look forward, our view is we're likely to be able to enjoy, call it, $4 plus or minus of advantage over most of the rest of the kind of the importing or gas-deficient regions."

They're not putting the kind of money into the deepwater and the Arctic and these more frontier regions that they used to be in terms of exploration development. In addition to that, we've also seen development activity in North America with respect to onshore oil production come off as well. So eventually, the problem solves itself. The stuff that's on continues to decline. The declines don't get replaced with new projects. And eventually, the oil market straightens out. The question is how far off are we from that happening? Today, it doesn't look like it's near, but certainly, at some point, the piper has to be paid, because if the investment hasn't gone into the exploration and development, eventually the supply dries up and the demand -- while the demand is growing."

But one of the benefits of the targeted precision ag is higher crop densities. And so if you're going to get the same kind of yield with higher density, you actually need to get an increase of nitrogen application per acre in order to accomplish anything at the grower level. So we do see those trends kind of moving in a direction that is, I would say, net-net positive for us over the long run. It might change the form a little bit or the timing of when that happens from the fall more into the spring, but that's one of the benefits that Bert talked about with our extensive flexible distribution network, that we're willing to inventory product and kind of take that risk off of the hands of the retailer and then capitalize on the opportunity when the application season does come. So for us, we look at all of those trends as being kind of a net positive for our business."

If you look at the base model of China, we have unsustainable coal prices, unsustainable logistics, unsustainable issues in terms of pollution and just areas surrounding what's being produced and exported. And so they are going to have to rationalize, and we see that taking place with 8 million tons coming off. And we expect additional rationalization, and if pricing remains at its current level, possibly permanent shutdowns. The export tariff is about $12 per ton. So if -- today, and this number has been moving, but Chinese urea is quoted in the $195 to $200 range FOB for granular. And so you cut that price down to, let's say, $185, you're still -- one, quality is poor or less -- it's not received as well as our products or some of the products coming out of the Arab Gulf. And so is that enough for them to compete? I don't think $12 is going to get them over the hump to allow them to compete on a consistent basis at the current market. So we expect to see -- they need to have rationalization. Their domestic industry cannot support the total capacity they have. So like Tony said, they're operating in the 60% to 65% operating rate and their exports are trending down. All those are trends that -- in the lowest-cost position that they will have with, again, coal being low, currency around CNY 6.65. And so the only thing probably going forward, I'd say, moderating is moderating up on all those issues. So you can get $12 on your export tariff, you're probably not going to lose that to raw material costs and freight costs over time."

So prices are slowly moving up. I think that's in recognition of when you look at the UAN and urea comparison. Both those products are trading at a very good value. And actually moving forward with maybe another question, looking at how farmers should be looking at nutrients for fall applications and even spring applications, yes, corn is down at, let's say, $3.40 for a forward harvest position of corn. But ammonia has moderated equally down, and all the nutrients are down. So on a nutrient basis, it's still profitable to plant, and we see consumption to be fairly strong."

We would expect to run the urea plant absolutely full out, with the excess being some incremental anhydrous that shows up in Port Neal.

And we're excited about the opportunities in South America because we do believe in the benefits of UAN and that's being received well, and so the growth is there. So I think you'll see us continue to grow those opportunities, but it is weighted against, obviously, netback options and what's best for the company. And so I think urea will grow as we bring the capacity online. If we have a differential again like we've had in -- for 6 months of this year, where the U.S. traded at discount to the international market, then we have a pretty good incentive to export the products out of the United States.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, in which we generated EBITDA of $329 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million after taking into account unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains, costs related to the termination of the OCI transaction, net foreign currency losses on intercompany loans, and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.
Included in these results, and not adjusted for, is a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $61 million. 
For the first half 2016, EBITDA was $536 million while adjusted EBITDA was $642 million after taking into account the same factors as for the second quarter. The first half results included realized loss on natural gas hedges of $117 million, which was not adjusted for. 
So even with the challenging conditions in the global fertilizer market, our underlying business performance remained strong. 
Before turning the call over to Bert and Dennis to give details on the quarter, I want to provide some observations and thoughts about the nitrogen market and our response to current industry conditions. There are some industry elements that are more structural and permanent in nature, while others tend to be more temporal. Fortunately, the elements that are structural tend to be strengths and benefit CF. These include: the global nitrogen demand continues to grow at roughly 2% per year, so there is strength underpinning our industry; natural gas represents about 2/3 to 3/4 of the cash cost of producing nitrogen, and North America has a long-term natural gas cost advantage; North America is one of the largest nitrogen consumption regions, where demand far exceeds domestic supply and, therefore, is heavily dependent upon imported products. 
CF is the world's low-cost nitrogen leader with the largest North American interior production and distribution system. CF's nutrient ton production will increase by more than 25% in the next few months, and as a result, CF has the enviable position of being structurally advantaged and one of the most profitable nitrogen manufacturers in the world, with significant growth imminent. 
However, the industry is under pressure, facing several significant challenges. Fortunately, these issues tend to be more transitory in nature and include: the nitrogen industry is in a state of significant overcapacity, with additional new capacity yet to still come on stream through 2017. However, there is little to no new capacity additions currently in flight beyond 2017, and with underlying demand growth in nitrogen, the global supply-demand balance should start to resolve beginning in 2018. 
The combination of excess nitrogen capacity with lower global energy costs, coupled with devaluation of certain key currencies and assisted by low transoceanic freight, have led to the dramatic fall in nitrogen product prices. We expect this situation to persist in the near term, with prices under continued pressure for 2017.
However, even in these conditions, CF enjoys greater than 30% gross margins. I want to pause for a moment and reemphasize this last point. We operate in a commodity business, and even in the face of significant industry overcapacity, with prices that have cratered, CF Industries was able to deliver first half 2016 gross margin of 35%. How was that possible in a commodity industry, you might ask. The answer is that although the global cost curve has widened with new capacity additions and has flattened because of lower global energy costs, it is certainly not flat, far from it. 
North America producers still enjoy a very significant advantage. With our realized price of urea at roughly $250 per ton in the second quarter, and with gas around $3 per MMBtu, the typical North American producer earns approximately 50% cash margin on incremental production. The takeaway here is that not all commodities are created equally, and we occupy a very advantaged position within the nitrogen industry. 
Current industry conditions are at a level that we believe is unsustainable over the medium term. Pricing is below cash cost for a significant amount of total global production, and industry profitability in many regions is too low to support normal maintenance and turnaround activity, let alone equity returns, and certainly well below that required for investments in new capacity. 
This situation is leading to curtailment or permanent closure of high-cost production. China alone has announced closure of over 4 million tons of urea since the first quarter and over 7.5 million tons year-to-date, with utilization rates currently around 60%. 
Similarly, producers in countries with relatively high costs, such as Lithuania, Hungary and Ukraine, have utilization rates under 60% as well. The net result is that although we expect difficult industry pricing conditions to persist through next year, the lack of meaningful new construction activity after 2017, coupled with expected capacity closures, is expected to lead to price recovery beginning in 2018. 
Against this backdrop, CF's long-term strategy remains unchanged, which is to focus on operational excellence by being a safe, efficient, reliable operator of our assets, while maximizing returns by leveraging our world-leading production and distribution network; grow our cash flow per share by delivering accretive initiatives, with returns well above our cost of capital; and maintain investment-grade ratings and a strong balance sheet, after which excess cash is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Our plan over the next 18 months is consistent with our long-standing strategy and addresses the current challenging industry environment. Specifically, we will complete and start up our major expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have fired up the reformer and expect ammonia production to begin during this quarter. 
At Port Neal, off-sites and utilities are complete and operational, and ammonia production is expected to begin late third quarter or early fourth quarter, with the urea plant to follow closely thereafter.
We will reduce annual CapEx to less than $450 million starting next year. This level of spend allows for continued safe, reliable and compliant operations, while reducing discretionary spending and conserving cash. We will reduce our controllable expenses and we'll maintain a strong balance sheet by preserving cash. To do this, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will be in a position to delever in 2018, when $800 million of debt matures.
Now let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis, who will discuss our performance for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Bert?"
22357184,377346580,1026037,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as they demonstrate the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The",1190,"Thanks, Tony. Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as they demonstrate the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The lower pricing environment of the second quarter was driven by global oversupply, with an excess of tons targeted to the U.S., despite NOLA and Tampa trading below international parity. 
In North America, the quarter began with solid demand at the beginning of April that helped to support selling prices. The strong run we witnessed in March for ammonia applications resulted in a portion of seasonal demand being pulled forward into the first quarter, which had a negative impact on the volume of second quarter ammonia shipments. 
The positive pricing position during the first quarter lasted for approximately 3 weeks into the second quarter, after which pricing moved steadily lower for all products.
In early April, there was a tale of 2 Corn Belts in the U.S., with Western farms planting on time, while the Eastern states were hampered by several weeks of wet and cold weather that delayed fertilizer applications in the middle of the season. This delay allowed wholesalers and traders a window to import additional product, and supply eventually exceeded demand. 
As a result, pricing fell throughout the quarter and hit levels that did not appear to make economic sense. By the middle of the quarter, wholesale liquidation took place, pushing prices even lower, with importers struggling to generate cash-positive returns.
The combination of additional imported product and subsequent liquidation pressured the urea barge market down below $200 per short ton FOB NOLA by early May. By the end of the quarter, the NOLA value for urea had fallen to just below $175 a short ton. 
Against this backdrop, the company's realized price for urea during the second quarter was $247 per short ton, a significant premium to prices reported at the U.S. Gulf. 
CF also responded to changing conditions by actively leveraging our scale, efficiency and expertise in distribution, targeting new alternative destinations and logistical options. Our fleet of over 5,500 railcars and 32 barges is complemented by over 2.5 million tons of North American storage and access to both the NuStar and Magellan ammonia pipelines. 
The recent completion of our reinjection terminal at Garner, Iowa, affords us new flexibility in how we move ammonia throughout the pipeline. By gaining the ability to reinject ammonia at this site, it allows our teams to instantaneously transport product from the Western Corn Belt to the Eastern Corn Belt, which is a tremendous benefit to have as Port Neal comes on later this year. 
In rail, we are identifying new approaches in how we can better transport additional volume. In the prior year, our teams did not have a single unit train depart the Donaldsonville site. In 2016, however, we have loaded 19 unit trains to date. For those who may not be familiar with shipping, unit trains become increasingly economical as the volume transported increases. And with the capacity expansion projects coming online, we have leveraged that additional volume to our benefit.
Additionally, the recent drafts of the Surface Transportation Board's language on competitive switching are encouraging and present additional opportunities to streamline rail distribution routes and reduce costs. 
Our team also responded to changes in the domestic fertilizer business through our ability to switch production quickly and safely from one product to another. As I described earlier, imports continued to pressure NOLA urea prices late in the quarter. However, during this time, UAN was trading at a premium to urea on a nitrogen-equivalent basis. We responded to this opportunity by pivoting our capacity to maximize our UAN production at the expense of urea. As a result, we're able to better capture the nutrient basis differential that was priced into the market at that time. This helped to improve our average price per ton for UAN, which was $202 per short ton for the second quarter of 2016. Many of our investors have heard us describe this capability that's built into our system before, and the second quarter was a prime example of our production and distribution flexibility and action. 
In aggregate, the combined result of an increased focus on system-wide maximization was healthy price realizations across the 3 major products: ammonia, urea and UAN, that were notably higher when compared to the referenced published prices at NOLA and Tampa. We believe that 2016 denotes the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, and we do not expect any new capacity to be added to the global system beyond 2017 and into the foreseeable future. 
As we have said many times, farmers must apply nitrogen every year to feed the world. As such, global demand for nitrogen continues to grow at an approximate rate of between 1.5% and 2.5% per year, or the equivalent of 2.7 million to 4.6 million metric tons of gross urea capacity. While this continued demand growth will absorb excess supply in the coming years, as Tony said, we see tangible evidence today that suggests that additional rationalization should continue to occur throughout the global system. 
In the current pricing environment, estimates indicate that despite the decrease in the cost curve, many global nitrogen producers are estimated to be operating at or near their variable costs. The result thus far has been more than 8 million short tons of globally urea capacity that has been shut down in 2016, with the vast majority of that capacity located in China. 
A steady decrease in Chinese operating rates to the lowest point in more than 4 years supports this observation. In periods of decreased domestic pricing, Chinese producers have historically looked to the export market. However, the trailing 12-month average of their exports has declined steadily since its peak in July of 2015, when prices globally were notably higher than they are today. 
Accordingly, Chinese exports are expected to reach full year volume of approximately 9 million to 10 million metric tons in 2016 compared to more than 14 million metric tons exported in 2015. 
Domestic prices in China are down approximately 30% year-over-year, and at a price of $195 per metric ton FOB China for export, we estimate that up to half of the urea industry in China is unprofitable. 
Moving on to the North American natural gas market. April Henry Hub prices -- cash prices began this second quarter below $2 per MMBtu, aided by a warmer-than-normal first quarter. Cash prices traded as low as $1.71 per MMBtu in mid-April, primarily due to a healthy storage balance and reduced demand coming out of winter. After ending the withdrawal season with nearly 2.5 Tcf in storage, strong demand and production declines contributed to a slower-than-normal start to the injection season. Throughout the quarter, natural gas prices have trended upward, with smaller-than-average storage injections and forecasts for a warm summer contributing to the increases. 
On June 30, natural gas traded at $2.93 in the cash market, an increase of $1.22 per MMBtu from the quarter low. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."
22357184,377346580,1026037,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert. In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20.

In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20. Included in these results were, on a pretax basis, approximately $211 million in unrealized net mark-to-market gains on our natural gas derivatives; $165 million in transaction costs, mainly comprising of the termination fee of $150 million paid to OCI; $38 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $19 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities. 
When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $342 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.33.
Included in these results is a realized loss of $61 million or $0.75 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $690 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior tax years associated with the bonus depreciation provision of the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent upon the timing and completion for certain capital projects. 
As of June 30, 2016, our prepaid income taxes were $855 million, including approximately the $690 million related to the carryback of these U.S. tax losses.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 53.2% and was impacted by the following items: first, we recaptured the manufacturing profits deduction we took in 2014, when we decided to carryback current tax losses to that year; second, we established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets related to our foreign operations. These were partially offset by the deduction of previously capitalized OCI transaction costs. The net effect of these 3 items is about a 20% increase in our tax rate. Excluding these items, our tax rate for the second quarter would have been closer to the statutory rate of 35%. Interest expense for the second quarter was $61 million and include the following: $76 million in interest on our outstanding debt plus $32 million in amortization of loan fees, which included amounts related to the terminated bridge loan associated with the OCI transaction, less $47 million in capitalized interest. 
The first distribution from CF Nitrogen to CHS under our strategic venture with them occurred on August 1, 2016, for $75 million. This total is comprised of approximately $30 million related to the partial first quarter of 2016, during which the strategic venture commenced, and approximately $45 million related to the second quarter of 2016. 
If you recall, each quarter, we recognize a noncontrolling interest amount related to this investment, which for the first quarter was $17 million and for the second quarter was $23 million. 
However, the cash distribution payable semiannually to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest in any given period, based on the terms of our agreements, which in effect provide producer economics to CHS. 
For 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, of which, $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $450 million to $500 million for sustaining, improvement and other projects. The increase in project spend is mainly related to labor productivity issues with third-party contractors. 
For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. This will focus on sustaining capital to ensure our plants and facilities operate in a safe, compliant and reliable fashion. As Tony mentioned, we are reducing discretionary capital expenditures, sustaining a strong liquidity position and maintaining and defending our investment-grade credit ratings. 
On July 29, 2016, the company amended its senior unsecured revolving credit agreement to reduce the size of the facility from $2 billion back to the $1.5 billion in place prior to the announcement of the OCI transaction and to increase the maximum total net leverage covenant from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. 
We have provided a schedule in the press release that goes over the details. This will provide us with additional liquidity and flexibility should we need it. 
We're also in the process of seeking a similar amendment from our private placement note holders. As of June 30, 2016, we were well in compliance with all covenants on our indebtedness. 
The amendment we have made to our revolver and the amendment we are seeking to make to our private placement notes reflect the prudent and proactive manner in which we manage our capital structure. Additionally, we have been making reductions in our controllable costs by managing down activity in M&A and information technology, along with a reduction in third-party plant level contractor expenses. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

We have been following and talking with our retailer and customer friends and realized that the desire to take on additional product late in Q2 was just not there. And we have the capability to manage our system, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, with different production levels at the plants as well as inventory and exports, and that's what we did. And so we ended up launching the program late in July, when normally it's been a June launch. And that afforded us the opportunity to participate more in the end market tail end of the application season, and a higher netback position was the result. But it also allowed our customers not to take maybe a month to 1.5 months of additional product into their inventory when they weren't prepared to do so. So looking at this year and where we are on volume for the fill program, our program at first was received a little coolly. Our prices probably were higher than what the market had anticipated. But as we've rolled it out and had conversations with our customers, it has been received better, and we have been taking on orders, and we're already shipping against some of those. And so what we look towards, the program was not designed to be as big as it had been in the past. We expect that there will be an improved market, and we want to participate in that market as we roll forward. And so we have taken on an acceptable amount of volume, and we will continue to do so as we go. Regarding the competitors and other people, I think there were some competitors who just weren't able to wait as long as we did or they may be saw a different market than we did and probably received a lower netback than we are. And some of that is also driven by imports. There are imports that come into this market. We're going to continue to be an import market and I think will be into the foreseeable future for all of the end products, and I think some of the other producers outside of United States decided to target some of their shipments probably at lower prices. And so we'll see that as the end values mature, you'll see those come back closer to their historical range and the market will move forward."

Now the things that can change that are if we see more rationalization sooner relative to the production base that's out there, you'll start seeing recovery more quickly. Or if you start seeing some more historical deltas in terms of energy prices around the globe that are reintroduced, that can also kind of accelerate the rate of price recovery. But I think our view is at the end of the day, kind of given the status quo assumption about ocean freight and where energy prices are trading, with the net amount of new production that's still coming online over the next 18 months, it's going to be tough sledding here for a number of competitors.

I mean, it's moved by a couple hundred thousand tons here and there, but it has not been a dramatic swing one direction or another. And even with all the new capacity coming online in North America, we will still be a substantial net importer of nitrogen. We'll need about 30% of our total nitrogen requirements to be met from imports. And North American producers are among the lowest-cost producers globally. So anyone that's got assets that are producing here in North America are going to run those plants flat out. And if there is trimming to be done on the global scene from a production standpoint, it's going to be in the high-cost regions. So it'll be -- the Chinese anthracite people will continue to shut down, some of the high-cost Eastern European gas countries, like, as we mentioned, Ukraine, Lithuania, Hungary and so forth. And then there are other regions where there's either sort of gas availability problems and you see curtailment like in Trinidad, for example, or in other regions where there's political instability like Libya, for example, where you'll also see some production coming off line. So as we look forward, one of the reasons we believe that pricing continues to be under pressure next year is the fact that there is this new capacity that you talked about coming online, but we don't really believe it's fundamentally going to move pricing dramatically lower than where it sits today, because we already think that there's a number of -- a substantial volume of capacity is already operating below cash cost. So it really can't go substantially lower than where we are, and it's certainly not going to affect the operating rates of North American producers."

There's another one that is kind of how LNG continues to evolve and how much of the new production ends up moving off of kind of oil-linked-based contracts more on to a spot basis. We think over time it's about $3 or $4 to get any sort of reasonable capital recovery on LNG contracts. And so if you say Henry Hub trades at kind of $3, that means LNG importing regions should trade somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 or maybe a little bit above by the time you re-gas and distribute from there into production plants. So as we look forward, our view is we're likely to be able to enjoy, call it, $4 plus or minus of advantage over most of the rest of the kind of the importing or gas-deficient regions."

They're not putting the kind of money into the deepwater and the Arctic and these more frontier regions that they used to be in terms of exploration development. In addition to that, we've also seen development activity in North America with respect to onshore oil production come off as well. So eventually, the problem solves itself. The stuff that's on continues to decline. The declines don't get replaced with new projects. And eventually, the oil market straightens out. The question is how far off are we from that happening? Today, it doesn't look like it's near, but certainly, at some point, the piper has to be paid, because if the investment hasn't gone into the exploration and development, eventually the supply dries up and the demand -- while the demand is growing."

But one of the benefits of the targeted precision ag is higher crop densities. And so if you're going to get the same kind of yield with higher density, you actually need to get an increase of nitrogen application per acre in order to accomplish anything at the grower level. So we do see those trends kind of moving in a direction that is, I would say, net-net positive for us over the long run. It might change the form a little bit or the timing of when that happens from the fall more into the spring, but that's one of the benefits that Bert talked about with our extensive flexible distribution network, that we're willing to inventory product and kind of take that risk off of the hands of the retailer and then capitalize on the opportunity when the application season does come.

If you look at the base model of China, we have unsustainable coal prices, unsustainable logistics, unsustainable issues in terms of pollution and just areas surrounding what's being produced and exported. And so they are going to have to rationalize, and we see that taking place with 8 million tons coming off. And we expect additional rationalization, and if pricing remains at its current level, possibly permanent shutdowns. The export tariff is about $12 per ton. So if -- today, and this number has been moving, but Chinese urea is quoted in the $195 to $200 range FOB for granular. And so you cut that price down to, let's say, $185, you're still -- one, quality is poor or less -- it's not received as well as our products or some of the products coming out of the Arab Gulf. And so is that enough for them to compete? I don't think $12 is going to get them over the hump to allow them to compete on a consistent basis at the current market. So we expect to see -- they need to have rationalization. Their domestic industry cannot support the total capacity they have. So like Tony said, they're operating in the 60% to 65% operating rate and their exports are trending down. All those are trends that -- in the lowest-cost position that they will have with, again, coal being low, currency around CNY 6.65.

And actually moving forward with maybe another question, looking at how farmers should be looking at nutrients for fall applications and even spring applications, yes, corn is down at, let's say, $3.40 for a forward harvest position of corn.

And we're excited about the opportunities in South America because we do believe in the benefits of UAN and that's being received well, and so the growth is there. So I think you'll see us continue to grow those opportunities, but it is weighted against, obviously, netback options and what's best for the company. And so I think urea will grow as we bring the capacity online. If we have a differential again like we've had in -- for 6 months of this year, where the U.S. traded at discount to the international market, then we have a pretty good incentive to export the products out of the United States.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account t",907,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release. The third quarter typically has our lowest volumes and lowest realized prices of the year, and this year was no different. 
The nitrogen cost curve has widened and flattened, pressuring product prices, as a significant amount of new capacity has come online globally. As capacity was increasing, the cost to produce and move nitrogen into market was decreasing due to lower feedstock and ocean freight costs and currency devaluations in certain production regions. 
In addition to low product prices and already seasonally low volume, the situation was exacerbated by a change in buyer behavior. The North American value chain delayed purchasing products, given the reluctance to take inventory risk as the application season was still several months away, and additional new capacity, including our own, will soon be online. As such, the channel largely took a wait-and-see approach to the quarter.  The net result was sluggish demand in North America and nitrogen product prices that fell to multiyear lows and were often trading below international parity. Bert will discuss this in more detail, including the moves we made in response to these conditions. 
The business generated $83 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter despite the challenging market conditions. A welcome new development has been the strengthening market conditions of late. Both sales volume and product prices have increased since the end of the quarter as buyers are finally moving off the sidelines and beginning to prepare for the application season. 
On our last call, we detailed plans to deal with difficult market conditions that are expected to persist through next year. Our continuing focus is safe, reliable operations; reducing our costs and capital expenditures; and maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $1.5 billion in cash in [ph] an undrawn revolver. Additionally, we expect to receive roughly $800 million in cash via tax refund in the third quarter next year, which is almost $3.50 per share. So we have the strong liquidity position we desire.
We have also made great progress in reducing both SG&A and direct manufacturing costs. In addition to our efforts to reduce costs and conserve cash, we highlighted our focus to complete the major capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have done just that. As we announced in October, the new ammonia plant is online and producing. With the new ammonia, urea and UAN plants all running at or above nameplate capacity, the expansion project at Donaldsonville has been officially completed. 
At Port Neal, we are in the process of starting up the plant. We had a successful test run of the urea granulation plant in September, and gas and steam have been introduced into the ammonia plant, and we're proceeding with the urea plant start-up in parallel.  As a result, we expect both ammonia and urea production at Port Neal to begin soon. 
To help make this happen, we have brought a seasoned team from Donaldsonville up to assist the Port Neal final commissioning and start-up of the plants, allowing us to leverage what we've learned from our experiences. With the completion of Donaldsonville and with Port Neal starting up, now is a good time to take a step back and assess the good and bad of the capacity expansion projects. 
I want to start by referring to Slide 11 of the materials posted to our website. The total capital cost to build the new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal was $5.2 billion. Those plants are expected to produce roughly 4 million product tons per year. However, CHS paid $2.8 billion and have the rights to 1.7 million tons of that production. So that leaves $2.4 billion of capital and roughly 2.3 million product tons for CF's account. Therefore, our resulting net capital cost was roughly $1,050 per product ton of new capacity. 
As Page 13 suggests, while our costs have greatly exceeded our initial estimate and we're certainly not happy about that, it is an all too common occurrence in the industry as every major North American project we could find reliable data on has similarly experienced significant cost overruns as well. What is ultimately important, though, is the capital cost per ton of new production capacity. 
As shown on Page 13, our new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal have an effective capital cost per ton of production that is among the lowest of all the observable plants built recently in North America. And what is really important, as detailed on Page 14, is that the effective IRR for the projects remains significantly above our cost of capital despite the increased costs and lower product price environment. The net result of all of this is that we remain pretty happy with our decision to do these capacity expansion projects and the fact that we sold an equity interest to CHS. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bert who will talk more about the market and our outlook in more detail, and then Dennis will discuss our performance and our work on reshaping part of our debt capital structure, after which I will offer some closing remarks. Bert?"
22357184,404826550,1071758,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. The [ph] supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrog",1074,"Thanks, Tony. The [ph] supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen prices of the U.S. Gulf remain below international parity for most of the third quarter, as Tony mentioned. Even as of late last week, lowly [ph] urea is trading at approximately $10 per short ton below the rest of the world. 
The global oversupply of nitrogen and its pressure on prices is not a new story. As we have said before, we believe 2016 represents the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, with capacity additions projected to  drop off sharply after mid-2017. As an industry, we have yet to see the full impact of the new North American production capacity, but that which has come online has begun to displace imports.
The low global prices have challenged the ability of high-cost producers to operate. The marginal producer, which remains [ph] Chinese anthracite coal plants, have also seen production and transportation costs rise. Rail and trucking costs in China have increased, and electricity  subsidies for smaller urea producers were eliminated in April. Additionally, coal prices have increased due to government-imposed mining restrictions. 
Anthracite lump coal prices in China have been flat for most of the third quarter, but recent published reports suggest that prices have increased 20% to 30%. This has translated to additional plants in China shutting down and fewer Chinese product being offered in the international marketplace via exports. Through the end of the quarter, approximately 8 million metric tons of annual urea capacity has been shut down in China, and we anticipate that number to continue to increase. 
This fundamental economic pressure is affecting pricing. The Chinese port price per metric ton for urea had risen to about $220 as we entered November, up from $194 per metric ton at the end of September. Also, the average U.S. Gulf price for urea barge product was approximately $180 [ph] per short ton for the third quarter, and today, it is $30 to $40 higher.  We anticipate that prices in the coming quarters will also be supported by stronger demand. 
During the low price environment of the third quarter, customers took a new approach to purchases. While the third quarter typically has the lowest prices and lowest volumes in North America, demand was pressured more than normal. The trend of lower prices over the last 18 months has increased inventory risk in the mind of the purchaser. Over the last 10 years, customers have purchased forward, received the product out of season as inventory and then delivered the product to their customers for [ph] either fall or spring applications. 
Today, this is much less the case. Many domestic customers told us they did not want to purchase product in the third quarter, preferring instead to take a wait-and-see approach to understand how the market will develop, particularly with new capacity expected to come online in North America. This approach was a deviation from historical purchasing patterns, but we responded to this environment in a few specific ways. 
First, we delayed the launch of our UAN fill program, and we capitalized on our flexibility export [ph] from Donaldsonville, particularly for UAN. Our sales team has put in a great deal of work in recent years to open up new markets for our product, and that effort is benefiting the company now. In the third quarter, we exported a record amount of UAN for the first 9 months of the year.  The UAN exports have increased 143% over the same period last year and have risen from under 100,000 tons in 2012 to more than 700,000 tons year-to-date in 2016 .
We have also increased shipments of UAN to the East and Gulf Coasts by way of a new vessel commissioned earlier this year, allowing CF to compete with imports. In the past, we have not participated in these regions in a significant way as farmers in the Cornbelt  consumed the vast majority of our UAN, and cost-effective grade options were limited. 
We also have a significant amount of in-market storage for our products, with over 1.2 million tons of ammonia storage, 1.3 million tons of UAN and over 500,000 tons of urea storage across our network. Even if buyers stop [ph] for a while on the sideline, historically, we have been able to fully operate our plants and position product for when demand materializes. 
As I've said many times, nitrogen is a necessary nutrient. It has to be applied every year. Additionally, despite the record or near-record corn and soybean crops expected this year, 2017 futures prices suggest continued profitability at the farm level for corn and soybeans. We are forecasting 88 million acres of corn and for wheat to acres [ph] to remain flat at 50 million acres. Assuming that the weather cooperates, when demand for fall application season begins, we expect to be strong. 
At the same time, we believe that North American downstream inventory of ammonia, urea and UAN is low following the spring application season. Urea imports were down 55% year-over-year in the third quarter as well, suggesting that purchasing activity will have to accelerate to be ready for spring. With buyers holding off purchases, we expect there to be robust, just-in-time demand during the application season, which, as I've outlined, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
We've also seen tremendous progress in our U.K. operations. Since CF purchased the plants at Ince and Billingham, the manufacturing teams have set a number of production records. The team there also delivered a record amount of fertilizer to U.K. farmers in July as their season began, and they continue to move all of their product. We've also benefited from a continued decline in U.K. natural gas prices, which had an average price in the third quarter of 2016 at [ph] $4.08 per MMBtu compared to $6.44 per MMBtu in the same quarter of 2015.
For the North American natural gas market, the December NYMEX contracts started the quarter near $3.36 per MMBtu and is currently trading at around $2.79 per MMBtu. During the third quarter of 2016, we did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for low-cost North American natural gas. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13. Included in these results on a pretax basis were approximately $21 million in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives; a $22 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative associated with the CHF strategic venture; $24 million of expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities; $18 million of stand-up costs for the Donaldsonville ammonia plant; $3 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $2 million of fees associated with the amendment of the private placement notes, partially offset by a $1 million gain on foreign currency derivatives. When [ph] taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $83 million, and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.13. 
Included in these results is a realized loss of $11 million or $0.17 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the third quarter of 2016. Our gross margin per ton of urea and UAN was affected by the commencement of depreciation of our capacity additions at Donaldsonville, which increased depreciation expense in the quarter by $19 million. Including this amount, total depreciation for the quarter amounted to about $83 million for the 2 segments and about $30 per ton and $43 per ton for urea and UAN, respectively. As we bring up the remaining plants, our depreciation will again increase. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $800 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior [ph] years, primarily related to the bonus depreciation provision in the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent in part on the timing of the completion of the expansion project at Port Neal. 
The company now projects a 2016 pretax loss, excluding noncontrolling interest. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $131 million on a pretax loss of $131 million. The amount recognized represents the reversal of tax provisions that we recorded in prior periods this year.
Interest expense for the third quarter was $31 million, with another $53 million of interest being capitalized in the quarter. As the capacity expansions are completed, interest capitalization will decrease dramatically, increasing reported interest expense on the income statement.
As you know, CHS is entitled to semiannual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC. The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS but not yet declared for the third quarter of 2016 is approximately $22 million. 
For the full year, the company expects to have total capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.8 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects, and $450 million to $475 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects. The total completed capital cost of all capacity expansion projects, both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, is estimated to be approximately $5.2 billion.
For 2017, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, returning CapEx to maintenance levels that continue our commitment to safe, compliant and reliable operations.
Let's turn now to our liquidity profile and capital structure. As we indicated in the release, due to the uncertain duration of the current low price environment, our company is taking steps to maintain strong liquidity and has made -- and is making certain changes to part of the debt capital structure to put in place financing more appropriate for the current business and operating environment. As of September 30, 2016, the company had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1.6 billion in and [ph] undrawn revolver and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements on all debt instruments. 
In addition to maintaining strong liquidity, our intention is to put in place a capital structure for the business we are as opposed to the business we thought we would be a year ago. We recently obtained required lender consent for an amendment of our revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions that would, among other things, change and add natural [ph] covenants, reduce the facility size from $1.5 billion to $750 million and add security interest to provide credit enhancement to the lenders. We believe this security enhancement gave the lenders confidence to give us the appropriate flexibility to continue paying our dividend.
We expect to assume [ph] the prepayment of the senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 and the related make-whole amount with the issuance of new long-term secured debt, borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, cash on hand or a combination of any of the foregoing.
As many of you recall, we issued the private placement notes when we were in the middle of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Because of that, we were unable to issue traditional registered investment-grade debt. Instead, we opted to issue private placement notes with longer maturities that were spread out over time to meet our capital needs. However, the private placement covenant package is not appropriate for a stand-alone CF in the current operating environment. The intent of prepaying the private placement notes is to replace them with financing that has a long-term covenant structure more consistent with traditional debt capital for a cyclical industry. 
Before I hand the call back to Tony,  I would like to end by discussing our capital allocation philosophy, which has not changed. While the current pricing environment has impacted our ratings in the near term, we remain committed to investment grade over the long term. We will continue our proven approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018 and again in 2020. If you look at our Slide 19, what you will see is that we have returned to shareholders more than twice as much as we have net [ph] invested in large projects and assets. 
Looking at Slide 20, you can see that since 2010, our approach has resulted in our shareholders having greatly increased exposure to our underlying business as measured by nitrogen nutrient tons per 1,000 shares. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

As we have tried to lay out in our slides on Pages 22 through 26, we believe that CF is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from recovery in the nitrogen sector. Although there is currently oversupply in the industry, global nitrogen demand is expected to continue to grow at roughly 2% per year. There is a lack of new plants scheduled to come online post-2017, and a result, the global supply-demand balance should tighten, leading to an increase in product prices.  As this price recovery begins in 2018 and continues thereafter, CF should benefit disproportionately.
As Page 26 indicates, a $25 per ton urea equivalent increase translates roughly to $350 million of additional EBITDA on an annual basis. Bert indicated that average published Q3 urea prices at NOLA was $180 per ton. However, prices are already $30 to $40 higher than that today.  With our new plants starting up and improving market conditions, we are very excited about the future. 
With that, operator, we'll open the call to questions."

And we have met with the railroads, and we continue to do, whether it's spot situations or looking at the complex as a whole. One of the things we did last year was we opened up Stolthaven, which allowed us to get on the NS [ph] and bypass some of the blocked activity we believe we're experiencing in Donaldsonville. We've also leveraged and moved up our barge participation on UAN, increasing the level. And then like I mentioned earlier, the exports.

And we've been -- we've moved to France for less than $15, $14 a ton. We can't move to St. Louis for that on UAN.

So we can produce ammonia, urea, UAN and some of the other products. We'll continue to do that and leverage those options up and down as the market necessitates. Then you go into loading options, and so -- where we have pipe, barge, truck, rail, vessel. Then you go next to terminal opportunities and where those terminals are. We have taken on some additional terminaling space, which we believe is in our long-term interest, in markets that we have not necessarily participated as much in the past, and we can effectively serve now with our logistical options. But you're right, exports are a great opportunity because you can immediately put 40,000 tons out and load it in a day. And so that's a great leverage point when you're looking at inventory at the plant and how you're moving it out incrementally into the interior. Buying patterns have changed, and we anticipate that they'll probably be this way for another year or so. But at the end of the day, you do have to have your product in place to serve the farmer customer. You can only move so many rail cars per day, and railcars can only make so many trip and then to return empty and load out and get in line. And so we believe that window closes and everyday is another loss shipment day that will challenge the delivery system. And this is more of a UAN story than it is for urea because I think you can move that up by barge up to the various terminals.  So we're fairly positive looking forward into 2017. We're -- if you really look at it, it protects us in Oklahoma. That will start applications in February Midwest, March and then April. So you're not much more than 4, 5 months away from applications.

Basically, those things were taken out in September as part of finance in the deal. At that time we did that, we weren't in a position to issue registered debt or even 1 44 a debt because we wouldn't have had the requisite financial information we needed to issue that. So what we did is we looked at the couple of options. We looked at potentially taking out 3 [ph] 5-year term loan to provide the financing. And the reason we rejected that option was because effectively if you look at the post closing of the OCI deal, there wouldn't have been, had we done that, around $4 billion worth of maturities occurring this between sort of 2016 and 2021, and that was a concentration of maturities that really wasn't was a bit high risk to us. So we didn't set, as we went to the private placement market where we could basically throw a lot of those maturities further out to 2025 and also to 2027 so that we would have a more laddered effect. Now with the business that we intended to have coming out of that deal, which would have included 3 new operated plants and through time significantly less debt and also the operating environment that we foresaw at that time, the covenants instruction in the private placement notes is not perceived to be problematic. But a couple of things happened since that point in time. A, we didn't do the CHS. We didn't do the OCI deal, so we never got the 3 additional operating plants. In addition to that, and certainly with respect to third quarter, things turned out a bit more adverse than we had anticipated. And so with that highlighted to us, what the need to make surer that with respect to our long-dated capital, that the long-dated capital that we had in place to finance the business should be long-dated in capital that is consistent with the business to the cyclical and goes through ups and downs and is robust to that from a covenant perspective. And the reason that, that's important to us is because having a more appropriate set of covenants gives us the flexibility, as I said, with respect to the revolving credit facility to continue to pay the dividend and do other things on the equity side that would be more difficult otherwise. And so -- but the actions that we're taking here are really around reducing the risk and uncertainty around that sort of stuff and putting our capital structure I na framework that's far more appropriate to the type of business that we are today in the environment we're in."

We're ready to put CO2 into the urea melt plant, the synthesis plant and kind of get that up and running. The off sites have all been sort of tested and are operational. And once we've got CO2 going over to the urea plant and the front end of the urea plant is operational, so, again, this isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing. We're putting sections of the plant in operation as we go. But again, our expectation here is based on our experience at Donaldsonville, the urea plants are sister plants from one another, and the one at D'Ville started up within a week. So we think we have plenty of time to get it up and operational. The Port Neal ammonia plant is a lot less complex than the Port Neal plant is -- or Port Neal's less complex than D'Ville because Port Neal is a 2,200-ton a day plant where D'Ville is a 3,300 and configuration of the thin loop in Donaldsonville is much more complex. There's a whole another section to it. So as we look at this, we feel very comfortable in terms of being able to get the plant online here by the end of the year, and that's why we continue to say $800 million in terms of the tax refund next year because we expect to get everything online."

And so that we would expect that spread to go up once Port Neal comes online because we're adding about 1.4 million tons in market that's going to have a $30, $40 a ton premium associated with it because that's a transportation costs from the Gulf. The work, that kinds of gives you a general sense of kind of the premium to the Gulf that we will expect. In addition, although ammonia is a little bit different animal because of the volume that's available out there in the deepwater market, we would expect UAN premium to come back in line with urea, and we can switch back and forth between granulating more or producing more solutions, depending upon where that premium sits to the extent that you don't get the corresponding bump that you would expect in UAN will ship the product mix. So I think over the medium to long term, those things have to come back into rough kind of equilibrium otherwise. The producers shift the mix and the end values have to trade sort of at a minimum on parity with very likely UAN continuing to command a premium the way it has."

So in the -- when we mentioned the weakness, it's more of the weakness in the ammonia price structure and why that was driven more in relation to the contractual structure of our industrial book of business, which is a gas based as well as Tampa based, and Tampa is very low. Demand has been a little bit lower in the Industrial segment due to some of the issues around capital and phosphate. I think this is just more of additional phosphates exports out of China has put a little pressure on some of the phosphate producers in terms of overall volumes and possible changes in mix as moving some to micronutrients, as Mosaic mentioned, away from possibly that. So weakness, it's just that I don't think it's anything we're concerned about and our volumes are, we think, it's going to hold steady. Regarding DEF, we're very more positive. What's going with the DEF market, continued demand. We're going to have a record year on DEF volume. Pricing is holding up. We're continuing to see the growth of the 30% to 40% that we have seen year-on-year. I do think that's due to this slight slowdown in shipments. You have probably seen the Class 8 truck volume, the new truck volume slowing down a little bit on that end, but you do have additional demand coming from off-road as well as different segments. So we're positive on the DEF front and continue to invest and grow and build the team and participate in that business."

In order to be able to get ammonia into the farmer's field, you have to have a place to move it to. And it's not like urea where you can just leave it on a rail car, put it on a shed kind of thing. In UAN, there's a lot of availability of tank space. With ammonia, you got -- you have to have a big cryogenic storage tanks and there's principally only 3 companies and they're the producers that own those. CF has got the largest network of the ammonia tank terminal system. Coke has got some and has got some. And then there's 1 to 2 Z tanks, given they are that owned by other people at Trammell, and so forth. But if you don't have the storage terminals, then you can't take Gulf ammonia up into the marketplace and get it in the hands of the farmers because you got no place to move it through. And so even though there is some impact in terms of agricultural demand or agricultural price [indiscernible] for ammonia, it's not directly tied to Tampa ammonia the way urea price in the Midwest is tied to NOLA urea price. So that's one of the reasons why [indiscernible] new terminal system that we've got in ammonia is so valuable because it allows us to capture a pretty sizable spread between the value of agricultural ammonia versus cheap -- relatively cheap deepwater ammonia."

And so, as I mentioned earlier, when you look at 10- to 30-day forecast, we see some positive developments in all of our terminal regions, even up in Canada which we received snow in October. In limited applications, we see that drying out and temperatures staying in the 50s in the afternoon, allowing applications to accelerate. And when you look at, as a farmer, for corn, you have a number of options for an application thereof. For ammonia, traditionally, the pass was 180 pounds per acre and you put it on the fall and you plant it in the spring and off you go. That has changed with the different economic prescriptions, and so we have seen a little bit less supply in the fall and then pick up an additional application in the spring. 2, 3 and 4 stage applications, a combination of ammonia, maybe Cyprus ammonia, or UAN, UAN top-dress or even flying over with urea. Each of those are positive for us. And so we do see ammonia in the fall as a component to good ergonomic corn practices and we see that continuing."

And so the problem is not from an investment-grade standpoint, the dividend or liquidity situation. We have plenty of cash. The issue is all around in the near term, the pricing environment and the EBITDA generation relative to the aggregate amount of debt that we've got outstanding on the business. And so change the dividend, don't change the dividend, it doesn't have a meaningful impact in terms of that particular metric. And that's why we've worked really hard on the credit facility to make sure that we've got the flexibility that allows us to continue paying the dividend going forward because that's an important element for the equity holders. And so our focus is to get back to investment grade, and we are planning, as Dennis articulated earlier, to retire the debt that comes due 2018. That's $800 million. And so we'll be delevering at that point. That will certainly help. And then as we move into price recovery and the factor about that time, we expect that will help as well.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account t",906,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release. The third quarter typically has our lowest volumes and lowest realized prices of the year, and this year was no different. 
The nitrogen cost curve has widened and flattened, pressuring product prices, as a significant amount of new capacity has come online globally. As capacity was increasing, the cost to produce and move nitrogen into market was decreasing due to lower feedstock and ocean freight costs and currency devaluations in certain production regions. 
In addition to low product prices and already seasonally low volume, the situation was exacerbated by a change in buyer behavior. The North American value chain delayed purchasing products, given the reluctance to take inventory risk as the application season was still several months away, and additional new capacity, including our own, will soon be online. As such, the channel largely took a wait-and-see approach to the quarter. The net result was sluggish demand in North America and nitrogen product prices that fell to multiyear lows and were often trading below international parity. Bert will discuss this in more detail, including the moves we made in response to these conditions. 
The business generated $83 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter despite the challenging market conditions. A welcome new development has been the strengthening market conditions of late. Both sales volume and product prices have increased since the end of the quarter as buyers are finally moving off the sidelines and beginning to prepare for the application season. 
On our last call, we detailed plans to deal with difficult market conditions that are expected to persist through next year. Our continuing focus is safe, reliable operations; reducing our costs and capital expenditures; and maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $1.5 billion in cash in an undrawn revolver. Additionally, we expect to receive roughly $800 million in cash via tax refund in the third quarter next year, which is almost $3.50 per share. So we have the strong liquidity position we desire.
We have also made great progress in reducing both SG&A and direct manufacturing costs. In addition to our efforts to reduce costs and conserve cash, we highlighted our focus to complete the major capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have done just that. As we announced in October, the new ammonia plant is online and producing. With the new ammonia, urea and UAN plants all running at or above nameplate capacity, the expansion project at Donaldsonville has been officially completed. 
At Port Neal, we are in the process of starting up the plant. We had a successful test run of the urea granulation plant in September, and gas and steam have been introduced into the ammonia plant, and we're proceeding with the urea plant start-up in parallel. As a result, we expect both ammonia and urea production at Port Neal to begin soon. 
To help make this happen, we have brought a seasoned team from Donaldsonville up to assist the Port Neal final commissioning and start-up of the plants, allowing us to leverage what we've learned from our experiences. With the completion of Donaldsonville and with Port Neal starting up, now is a good time to take a step back and assess the good and bad of the capacity expansion projects. 
I want to start by referring to Slide 11 of the materials posted to our website. The total capital cost to build the new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal was $5.2 billion. Those plants are expected to produce roughly 4 million product tons per year. However, CHS paid $2.8 billion and have the rights to 1.7 million tons of that production. So that leaves $2.4 billion of capital and roughly 2.3 million product tons for CF's account. Therefore, our resulting net capital cost was roughly $1,050 per product ton of new capacity. 
As Page 13 suggests, while our costs have greatly exceeded our initial estimate and we're certainly not happy about that, it is an all too common occurrence in the industry as every major North American project we could find reliable data on has similarly experienced significant cost overruns as well. What is ultimately important, though, is the capital cost per ton of new production capacity. 
As shown on Page 13, our new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal have an effective capital cost per ton of production that is among the lowest of all the observable plants built recently in North America. And what is really important, as detailed on Page 14, is that the effective IRR for the projects remains significantly above our cost of capital despite the increased costs and lower product price environment. The net result of all of this is that we remain pretty happy with our decision to do these capacity expansion projects and the fact that we sold an equity interest to CHS. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bert who will talk more about the market and our outlook in more detail, and then Dennis will discuss our performance and our work on reshaping part of our debt capital structure, after which I will offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

In fact, nitrogen pric",1065,"Thanks, Tony. A supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen prices of the U.S. Gulf remain below international parity for most of the third quarter, as Tony mentioned. Even as of late last week, NOLA urea is trading at approximately $10 per short ton below the rest of the world. 
The global oversupply of nitrogen and its pressure on prices is not a new story. As we have said before, we believe 2016 represents the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, with capacity additions projected to drop off sharply after mid-2017. As an industry, we have yet to see the full impact of the new North American production capacity, but that which has come online has begun to displace imports.
The low global prices have challenged the ability of high-cost producers to operate. The marginal producer, which remains Chinese anthracite coal plants, have also seen production and transportation costs rise. Rail and trucking costs in China have increased, and electricity subsidies for smaller urea producers were eliminated in April. Additionally, coal prices have increased due to government-imposed mining restrictions. 
Anthracite lump coal prices in China have been flat for most of the third quarter, but recent published reports suggest that prices have increased 20% to 30%. This has translated to additional plants in China shutting down and fewer Chinese product being offered in the international marketplace via exports. Through the end of the quarter, approximately 8 million metric tons of annual urea capacity has been shut down in China, and we anticipate that number to continue to increase. 
This fundamental economic pressure is affecting pricing. The Chinese port price per metric ton for urea had risen to about $220 as we entered November, up from $194 per metric ton at the end of September. Also, the average U.S. Gulf price for urea barge product was approximately $180 per short ton for the third quarter, and today, it is $30 to $40 higher. We anticipate that prices in the coming quarters will also be supported by stronger demand. 
During the low price environment of the third quarter, customers took a new approach to purchases. While the third quarter typically has the lowest prices and lowest volumes in North America, demand was pressured more than normal. The trend of lower prices over the last 18 months has increased inventory risk in the mind of the purchaser. Over the last 10 years, customers have purchased forward, received the product out of season as inventory and then delivered the product to their customers for either fall or spring applications. 
Today, this is much less the case. Many domestic customers told us they did not want to purchase product in the third quarter, preferring instead to take a wait-and-see approach to understand how the market will develop, particularly with new capacity expected to come online in North America. This approach was a deviation from historical purchasing patterns, but we responded to this environment in a few specific ways. 
First, we delayed the launch of our UAN fill program, and we capitalized on our flexibility export from Donaldsonville, particularly for UAN. Our sales team has put in a great deal of work in recent years to open up new markets for our product, and that effort is benefiting the company now. In the third quarter, we exported a record amount of UAN for the first 9 months of the year. The UAN exports have increased 143% over the same period last year and have risen from under 100,000 tons in 2012 to more than 700,000 tons year-to-date in 2016 .
We have also increased shipments of UAN to the East and Gulf Coasts by way of a new vessel commissioned earlier this year, allowing CF to compete with imports. In the past, we have not participated in these regions in a significant way as farmers in the Cornbelt consumed the vast majority of our UAN, and cost-effective grade options were limited. 
We also have a significant amount of in-market storage for our products, with over 1.2 million tons of ammonia storage, 1.3 million tons of UAN and over 500,000 tons of urea storage across our network. Even if buyers step for a while on the sideline, historically, we have been able to fully operate our plants and position product for when demand materializes. 
As I've said many times, nitrogen is a necessary nutrient. It has to be applied every year. Additionally, despite the record or near-record corn and soybean crops expected this year, 2017 futures prices suggest continued profitability at the farm level for corn and soybeans. We are forecasting 88 million acres of corn and for wheat to acres to remain flat at 50 million acres. Assuming that the weather cooperates, when demand for fall application season begins, we expect to be strong. 
At the same time, we believe that North American downstream inventory of ammonia, urea and UAN is low following the spring application season. Urea imports were down 55% year-over-year in the third quarter as well, suggesting that purchasing activity will have to accelerate to be ready for spring. With buyers holding off purchases, we expect there to be robust, just-in-time demand during the application season, which, as I've outlined, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
We've also seen tremendous progress in our U.K. operations. Since CF purchased the plants at Ince and Billingham, the manufacturing teams have set a number of production records. The team there also delivered a record amount of fertilizer to U.K. farmers in July as their season began, and they continue to move all of their product. We've also benefited from a continued decline in U.K. natural gas prices, which had an average price in the third quarter of 2016 at $4.08 per MMBtu compared to $6.44 per MMBtu in the same quarter of 2015.
For the North American natural gas market, the December NYMEX contracts started the quarter near $3.36 per MMBtu and is currently trading at around $2.79 per MMBtu. During the third quarter of 2016, we did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for low-cost North American natural gas. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."
22357184,404826550,1072057,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert.

Included in these results on a pretax basis were approximately $21 million in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on",1059,"Thanks, Bert. In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13. Included in these results on a pretax basis were approximately $21 million in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives; a $22 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative associated with the CHF strategic venture; $24 million of expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities; $18 million of stand-up costs for the Donaldsonville ammonia plant; $3 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $2 million of fees associated with the amendment of the private placement notes, partially offset by a $1 million gain on foreign currency derivatives. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $83 million, and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.13. 
Included in these results is a realized loss of $11 million or $0.17 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the third quarter of 2016. Our gross margin per ton of urea and UAN was affected by the commencement of depreciation of our capacity additions at Donaldsonville, which increased depreciation expense in the quarter by $19 million. Including this amount, total depreciation for the quarter amounted to about $83 million for the 2 segments and about $30 per ton and $43 per ton for urea and UAN, respectively. As we bring up the remaining plants, our depreciation will again increase. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $800 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior years, primarily related to the bonus depreciation provision in the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent in part on the timing of the completion of the expansion project at Port Neal. 
The company now projects a 2016 pretax loss, excluding noncontrolling interest. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $131 million on a pretax loss of $131 million. The amount recognized represents the reversal of tax provisions that we recorded in prior periods this year.
Interest expense for the third quarter was $31 million, with another $53 million of interest being capitalized in the quarter. As the capacity expansions are completed, interest capitalization will decrease dramatically, increasing reported interest expense on the income statement.
As you know, CHS is entitled to semiannual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC. The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS but not yet declared for the third quarter of 2016 is approximately $22 million. 
For the full year, the company expects to have total capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.8 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects, and $450 million to $475 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects. The total completed capital cost of all capacity expansion projects, both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, is estimated to be approximately $5.2 billion.
For 2017, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, returning CapEx to maintenance levels that continue our commitment to safe, compliant and reliable operations.
Let's turn now to our liquidity profile and capital structure. As we indicated in the release, due to the uncertain duration of the current low price environment, our company is taking steps to maintain strong liquidity and has made -- and is making certain changes to part of the debt capital structure to put in place financing more appropriate for the current business and operating environment. As of September 30, 2016, the company had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1.6 billion in undrawn revolver and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements on all debt instruments. 
In addition to maintaining strong liquidity, our intention is to put in place a capital structure for the business we are as opposed to the business we thought we would be a year ago. We recently obtained required lender consent for an amendment of our revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions that would, among other things, change and add natural covenants, reduce the facility size from $1.5 billion to $750 million and add security interest to provide credit enhancement to the lenders. We believe this security enhancement gave the lenders confidence to give us the appropriate flexibility to continue paying our dividend.
We expect to fund the prepayment of the senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 and the related make-whole amount with the issuance of new long-term secured debt, borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, cash on hand or a combination of any of the foregoing.
As many of you recall, we issued the private placement notes when we were in the middle of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Because of that, we were unable to issue traditional registered investment-grade debt. Instead, we opted to issue private placement notes with longer maturities that were spread out over time to meet our capital needs. However, the private placement covenant package is not appropriate for a stand-alone CF in the current operating environment. The intent of prepaying the private placement notes is to replace them with financing that has a long-term covenant structure more consistent with traditional debt capital for a cyclical industry. 
Before I hand the call back to Tony, I would like to end by discussing our capital allocation philosophy, which has not changed. While the current pricing environment has impacted our ratings in the near term, we remain committed to investment grade over the long term. We will continue our proven approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018 and again in 2020. If you look at our Slide 19, what you will see is that we have returned to shareholders more than twice as much as we have net invested in large projects and assets. 
Looking at Slide 20, you can see that since 2010, our approach has resulted in our shareholders having greatly increased exposure to our underlying business as measured by nitrogen nutrient tons per 1,000 shares. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

As we have tried to lay out in our slides on Pages 22 through 26, we believe that CF is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from recovery in the nitrogen sector. Although there is currently oversupply in the industry, global nitrogen demand is expected to continue to grow at roughly 2% per year. There is a lack of new plants scheduled to come online post-2017, and a result, the global supply-demand balance should tighten, leading to an increase in product prices. As this price recovery begins in 2018 and continues thereafter, CF should benefit disproportionately.
As Page 26 indicates, a $25 per ton urea equivalent increase translates roughly to $350 million of additional EBITDA on an annual basis. Bert indicated that average published Q3 urea prices at NOLA was $180 per ton. However, prices are already $30 to $40 higher than that today. With our new plants starting up and improving market conditions, we are very excited about the future.

Over the next year or 2, you're right, there is additional capacity coming online. We expect most of that North American capacity to be converted into upgraded products.

And what we have done, I'll tell you, the rail rates have gone up, and there's been an impact on UAN. And we have met with the railroads, and we continue to do, whether it's spot situations or looking at the complex as a whole. One of the things we did last year was we opened up Stolthaven, which allowed us to get on the NS and bypass some of the blocked activity we believe we're experiencing in Donaldsonville. We've also leveraged and moved up our barge participation on UAN, increasing the level. And then like I mentioned earlier, the exports. And so we're able to achieve a fairly attractive netback, moving our product to all over the globe but principally to Argentina, Uruguay, Europe and some new markets we're developing. And we've been -- we've moved to France for less than $15, $14 a ton. We can't move to St. Louis for that on UAN. And so as you see us develop and grow and mature, we're going to continue to leverage those options and to benefit us. There's other opportunities for what we're doing. We've met with the railroads on shipping out of Port Neal. We have UP and BN servicing that plant, but we've built that facility to fully load that product up by truck. And so you have to take defensive measures during these times to be able to position yourselves to pull in the attractive pricing for rail and other logistical options. And that's what we're doing."

And so that's what we're planning in terms of the parallel commissioning. So it's very likely that urea will actually be online before the ammonia plant is fully up. It's a simpler plant to commission, and granulations are already operational. But our expectation is it's a matter of a couple of weeks, maybe 3 or 4, depends upon the number of little issues that you find as you go through it.

So we can produce ammonia, urea, UAN and some of the other products. We'll continue to do that and leverage those options up and down as the market necessitates. Then you go into loading options, and so -- where we have pipe, barge, truck, rail, vessel. Then you go next to terminal opportunities and where those terminals are. We have taken on some additional terminaling space, which we believe is in our long-term interest, in markets that we have not necessarily participated as much in the past and we can effectively serve now with our logistical options. But you're right, exports are a great opportunity because you can immediately put 40,000 tons out and load it in a day. And so that's a great leverage point when you're looking at inventory at the plant and how you're moving it out incrementally into the interior. Buying patterns have changed, and we anticipate that they'll probably be this way for another year or so. But at the end of the day, you do have to have your product in place to serve the farmer customer. You can only move so many railcars per day. And the railcars can only make so many trips, and they have to return empty and load out and get in line. And so we believe that as that window closes and every day is another lost shipment day, that, that will challenge the delivery system. And this is more of a UAN story than it is for urea because I think you can move that up by barge and up to the various terminals. So we're fairly positive looking forward into 2017. We're -- if you really look at it, it protects us in Oklahoma. That'll start applications in February, Midwest, March and then April. So you're not much more than 4, 5 months away from applications. We're just starting winter. We're already looking into spring. So we're -- we think it's going to turn out pretty well for us."

The point, though, that I'd like to highlight just to remind everybody of, and we've got a slide to this effect in the appendix, but even after all of the new capacity that's in flight to North America comes online, North America is still going to be a very import-dependent region where there's about 30% of our total nitrogen demand has got to be met by imports. So when we're exporting here and there, it really is just around the edges and primarily during periods of time when there isn't a lot going to ground in North America and there's demand in other regions. So it's a way to maximize overall system netbacks, not a have-to-do kind of thing."

And we said that in the -- in our prepared remarks, that basically, those things were taken out in September as part of financing the OCI deal. At the time we did that, we weren't in a position to reissue registered debt or even 144 a debt because we wouldn't have had the requisite financial information we needed to issue that. And so what we did is we looked at a couple of options. We looked at potentially taking out a 3- or 5-year term loan to provide the financing. And the reason we rejected that option was because effectively, if you looked at the post-closing of the OCI deal, there would have been, had we done that, around $4 billion worth of maturities occurring between sort of 2016 and 2021. And that was a concentration of maturities that really wasn't -- that was a bit high risk for us. So we didn't. Instead, we went to the private placement market where we could basically throw a lot of those maturities further out to 2025 and also to 2027 so that we would have more -- a more laddered effect. Now with the business that we intended to have coming out of that deal, which would have included 3 new operating plants and through time, significantly less debt and also the operating environment that we foresaw at that time, the covenant instruction in the private placement notes was not perceived to be problematic. But a couple of things happened since that point in time: a, we didn't do the CHS -- we didn't do the OCI deal and so that we never got the 3 additional operating plants. In addition to that and certainly with respect to third quarter, things turned out a bit more adverse than we had anticipated. And so what that highlighted to us was the need to make sure that, with respect to our long-dated capital, that the long-dated capital that we had in place to finance the business should be long-dated capital that is consistent with a business that is cyclical and goes through ups and downs and is robust to that from a covenant perspective. And the reason that that's important to us is because having a more appropriate set of covenants gives us the flexibility, as I said, with respect to the revolving credit facility to continue to pay the dividend and do other things on the equity side that would be more difficult otherwise. And so -- but the actions that we're taking here are really around reducing the risk and uncertainty around that sort of stuff and putting our capital structure in a framework that's far more appropriate for the type of business that we are today and the environment we're in."

The off-sites have all been sort of tested and are operational and once we've got CO2 going over to the urea plant and the front end of the ammonia plant is operational. So again, this isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing. We're putting sections of the plant in operation as we go. But again, our expectation here is based on our experience at Donaldsonville, the urea plants are sister plants from one another, and the one at D'Ville started up within a week. So we think we got plenty of time to get it up and operational. The Port Neal ammonia plant is a lot less complex than the Port Neal plant is -- or Port Neal's less complex than D'Ville because Port Neal is a 2,200-ton a day plant where D'Ville is a 3,300. And the configuration of the syn-loop in Donaldsonville is much more complex. There's a whole another section to it. So as we look at this, we feel very comfortable in terms of being able to get the plant online here by the end of the year, and that's why we continue to say $800 million in terms of the tax refund next year because we expect to get everything online."

As Tony described to you, the Port Neal piece has to do with the amount because it's what drives ultimately for a portion of our depreciation, whether you have depreciation in your tax loss for '16 that you carry back or whether you don't and how much. And like Tony said, it's not an all-or-nothing type thing. There's a sort of a continuing lag that comes. But our strong expectation remains that we'll be fully depreciating those assets this year."

And so that -- we would expect that spread to go up once Port Neal comes online because we're adding about 1.4 million tons in market that's going to have a $30, $40 a ton premium associated with it because that's the transportation costs from the Gulf. And so we're -- that kind of gives you a general sense of kind of the premium to the Gulf that we would expect. In addition, although ammonia is a little bit different animal because of the volume that's available out there in the deepwater market, we would expect UAN premium to come back in line with urea, and we can switch back and forth between granulating more or producing more solutions, depending upon where that premium sits and to the extent that you don't get the corresponding bump that you would expect in UAN, we'll just shift the product mix. So I think over the medium to long term, those things have to come back into rough kind of equilibrium. Otherwise, the producers shift the mix, and the end values have to trade sort of at a minimum on parity, with very likely UAN continuing to command a premium the way it has."

So in the -- when we mentioned the weakness, it's more of the weakness in the ammonia price structure and why that was driven more in relation to the contractual structure of our industrial book of business, which is gas based as well as Tampa based, and Tampa is very low. Demand has been a little bit lower in the Industrial segment due to some of the issues around caprolactam and phosphate. I think this is just a bit more of additional phosphate exports out of China has put a little more pressure on some of the other phosphate producers in terms of overall volumes and possible changes in mix as moving some to micronutrients, as Mosaic has mentioned, away from possibly DAP. So weakness, it's just I don't think it's anything we're concerned about, and we're -- our volumes are, we think, going to hold steady. Regarding DEF, we're very -- more positive. What's going on in the DEF market, continued demand, we're going to have a record year on DEF volume. Pricing is holding up. We're continuing to see the growth of the 30% to 40% that we have seen year-on-year. I do think that just due to this slight slowdown in shipments, you have probably seen the Class 8 truck volume, the new truck volume slowing down a little bit on that end, but you do have additional demand coming from off-road as well as different segments.

In order to be able to get ammonia into the farmer's field, you have to have a place to move it to. And it's not like urea where you can just leave it on a railcar and put it in a shed kind of thing. In UAN, there's a lot of availability of tank space. With ammonia, you got -- you have to have the big cryogenic storage tanks. And there's principally only 3 companies, and they're the producers that own those. CF has got the largest network of the ammonia tank and terminal system. Coke has got some, and Agrium has got some. And then there's kind of onesie-twosie tanks here and there that are owned by other people at Trammo and so forth. But if you don't have the storage terminals, then you can't take Gulf ammonia up into the marketplace and get it in the hands of the farmers because you got no place to move it through. And so even though there is some impact in terms of agricultural demand or agricultural prices for ammonia, it's not directly tied to Tampa ammonia the way urea price in the Midwest is tied to NOLA urea price. So there -- that's one of the reasons why the discount usually in the terminal system that we have got in ammonia is so valuable because it allows us to capture a pretty sizable spread between the value of agricultural ammonia versus cheap -- relatively cheap deepwater ammonia."

In limited applications, we see that drying out and temperatures staying in the 50s in the afternoon, allowing probably applications to accelerate. And when you look at, as a farmer, for corn, you have a number of options for an application thereof. For ammonia, traditionally, in the past, it was 180 pounds per acre. You put it in the fall, and you plant it in the spring, and off you go. That has changed with the different agronomic prescriptions. And so we have seen a little bit less supplied in the fall and then pick up an additional application in the spring, 2, 3 and 4 stage applications, a combination of ammonia, maybe side-dress ammonia or UAN, UAN top-dress or even flying over with urea.

And so the problem is not from an investment-grade standpoint, the dividend or our liquidity situation. We've got plenty of cash. The issue is all around, in the near term, the pricing environment and the EBITDA generation relative to the aggregate amount of debt that we've got outstanding on the business. And so change the dividend, don't change the dividend, it doesn't have a meaningful impact in terms of that particular metric. And that's why we've worked really hard on the secured credit facility to make sure that we've got the flexibility that allows us to continue paying the dividend going forward because that's an important element for the equity holders. And so our focus is to get back to investment grade, and we are planning, as Dennis articulated earlier, to retire the debt that comes due 2018. That's $800 million. And so we'll be delevering at that point. That will certainly help. And then as we move into price recovery and the factor about that time, we expect that'll help as well.

22357184,404826550,1072340,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account t",906,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release. The third quarter typically has our lowest volumes and lowest realized prices of the year, and this year was no different. 
The nitrogen cost curve has widened and flattened, pressuring product prices, as a significant amount of new capacity has come online globally. As capacity was increasing, the cost to produce and move nitrogen into market was decreasing due to lower feedstock and ocean freight costs and currency devaluations in certain production regions. 
In addition to low product prices and already seasonally low volume, the situation was exacerbated by a change in buyer behavior. The North American value chain delayed purchasing products, given the reluctance to take inventory risk as the application season was still several months away, and additional new capacity, including our own, will soon be online. As such, the channel largely took a wait-and-see approach to the quarter. The net result was sluggish demand in North America and nitrogen product prices that fell to multiyear lows and were often trading below international parity. Bert will discuss this in more detail, including the moves we made in response to these conditions. 
The business generated $83 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter despite the challenging market conditions. A welcome new development has been the strengthening market conditions of late. Both sales volume and product prices have increased since the end of the quarter as buyers are finally moving off the sidelines and beginning to prepare for the application season. 
On our last call, we detailed plans to deal with difficult market conditions that are expected to persist through next year. Our continuing focus is safe, reliable operations; reducing our costs and capital expenditures; and maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $1.5 billion in cash and an undrawn revolver. Additionally, we expect to receive roughly $800 million in cash via tax refund in the third quarter next year, which is almost $3.50 per share. So we have the strong liquidity position we desire.
We have also made great progress in reducing both SG&A and direct manufacturing costs. In addition to our efforts to reduce costs and conserve cash, we highlighted our focus to complete the major capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have done just that. As we announced in October, the new ammonia plant is online and producing. With the new ammonia, urea and UAN plants all running at or above nameplate capacity, the expansion project at Donaldsonville has been officially completed. 
At Port Neal, we are in the process of starting up the plant. We had a successful test run of the urea granulation plant in September, and gas and steam have been introduced into the ammonia plant, and we're proceeding with the urea plant start-up in parallel. As a result, we expect both ammonia and urea production at Port Neal to begin soon. 
To help make this happen, we have brought a seasoned team from Donaldsonville up to assist the Port Neal final commissioning and start-up of the plants, allowing us to leverage what we've learned from our experiences. With the completion of Donaldsonville and with Port Neal starting up, now is a good time to take a step back and assess the good and bad of the capacity expansion projects. 
I want to start by referring to Slide 11 of the materials posted to our website. The total capital cost to build the new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal was $5.2 billion. Those plants are expected to produce roughly 4 million product tons per year. However, CHS paid $2.8 billion and have the rights to 1.7 million tons of that production. So that leaves $2.4 billion of capital and roughly 2.3 million product tons for CF's account. Therefore, our resulting net capital cost was roughly $1,050 per product ton of new capacity. 
As Page 13 suggests, while our costs have greatly exceeded our initial estimate and we're certainly not happy about that, it is an all too common occurrence in the industry as every major North American project we could find reliable data on has similarly experienced significant cost overruns as well. What is ultimately important, though, is the capital cost per ton of new production capacity. 
As shown on Page 13, our new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal have an effective capital cost per ton of production that is among the lowest of all the observable plants built recently in North America. And what is really important, as detailed on Page 14, is that the effective IRR for the projects remains significantly above our cost of capital despite the increased costs and lower product price environment. The net result of all of this is that we remain pretty happy with our decision to do the capacity expansion projects and the fact that we sold an equity interest to CHS. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bert who will talk more about the market and our outlook in more detail, and then Dennis will discuss our performance and our work on reshaping part of our debt capital structure, after which I will offer some closing remarks. Bert?"
22357184,404826550,1072340,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. The supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen pr",1066,"Thanks, Tony. The supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen prices at the U.S. Gulf remained below international parity for most of the third quarter, as Tony mentioned. Even as of late last week, NOLA urea is trading at approximately $10 per short ton below the rest of the world. 
The global oversupply of nitrogen and its pressure on prices is not a new story. As we have said before, we believe 2016 represents the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, with capacity additions projected to drop off sharply after mid-2017. As an industry, we have yet to see the full impact of the new North American production capacity, but that which has come online has begun to displace imports.
The low global prices have challenged the ability of high-cost producers to operate. The marginal producer, which remains Chinese anthracite coal plants, have also seen production and transportation costs rise. Rail and trucking costs in China have increased, and electricity subsidies for small urea producers were eliminated in April. Additionally, coal prices have increased due to government-imposed mining restrictions. 
Anthracite lump coal prices in China had been flat for most of the third quarter, but recent published reports suggest that prices have increased 20% to 30%. This has translated to additional plants in China shutting down and fewer Chinese product being offered in the international marketplace via exports. Through the end of the quarter, approximately 8 million metric tons of annual urea capacity has been shut down in China, and we anticipate that number to continue to increase. 
This fundamental economic pressure is affecting pricing. The Chinese port price per metric ton for urea had risen to about $220 as we enter November, up from $194 per metric ton at the end of September. Also, the average U.S. Gulf price for urea barged product was approximately $180 per short ton for the third quarter, and today, it is $30 to $40 higher. We anticipate that prices in the coming quarters will also be supported by stronger demand. 
During the low price environment of the third quarter, customers took a new approach to purchases. While the third quarter typically has the lowest prices and lowest volumes in North America, demand was pressured more than normal. The trend of lower prices over the last 18 months has increased inventory risk in the mind of the purchaser. Over the last 10 years, customers have purchased forward, received the product out of season as inventory and then delivered the product to their customers for either fall or spring applications. 
Today, this is much less the case. Many domestic customers told us they did not want to purchase product in the third quarter, preferring instead to take a wait-and-see approach to understand how the market will develop, particularly with new capacity expected to come online in North America. This approach was a deviation from historical purchasing patterns, but we responded to this environment in a few specific ways. 
First, we delayed the launch of our UAN fill program, and we capitalized on our flexibility to export from Donaldsonville, particularly for UAN. Our sales team has put in a great deal of work in recent years to open up new markets for our product, and that effort is benefiting the company now. In the third quarter, we exported a record amount of UAN for the first 9 months of the year. The UAN exports have increased 143% over the same period last year and have risen from under 100,000 tons in 2012 to more than 700,000 tons year-to-date in 2016.
We have also increased shipments of UAN to the East and Gulf Coasts by way of a new vessel commissioned earlier this year, allowing CF to compete with imports. In the past, we have not participated in these regions in a significant way as farmers in the Corn Belt consumed the vast majority of our UAN and cost-effective freight options were limited. 
We also have a significant amount of in-market storage for our products, with over 1.2 million tons of ammonia storage, 1.3 million tons of UAN and over 500,000 tons of urea storage across our network. Even if buyers sat for a while on the sideline, historically, we have been able to fully operate our plants and position product for when demand materializes. 
As I've said many times, nitrogen is a necessary nutrient. It has to be applied every year. Additionally, despite the record or near-record corn and soybean crops expected this year, 2017 futures prices suggest continued profitability at the farm level for corn and soybeans. We are forecasting 88 million acres of corn and for wheat acres to remain flat at 50 million acres. Assuming that the weather cooperates, when demand for fall application season begins, we expect it to be strong. 
At the same time, we believe that North American downstream inventory of ammonia, urea and UAN is low following the spring application season. Urea imports were down 55% year-over-year in the third quarter as well, suggesting that purchasing activity will have to accelerate to be ready for spring. With buyers holding off purchases, we expect there to be robust, just-in-time demand during the application season, which, as I've outlined, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
We've also seen tremendous progress in our U.K. operations. Since CF purchased the plants at Ince and Billingham, the manufacturing teams have set a number of production records. The team there also delivered a record amount of fertilizer to U.K. farmers in July as their season began, and they continue to move all of their product. We've also benefited from a continued decline in U.K. natural gas prices, which had an average price in the third quarter of 2016 of $4.08 per MMBtu compared to $6.44 per MMBtu in the same quarter of 2015.
For the North American natural gas market, the December NYMEX contracts started the quarter near $3.36 per MMBtu and is currently trading at around $2.79 per MMBtu. During the third quarter of 2016, we did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for low-cost North American natural gas. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13.

In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13. Included in these results, on a pretax basis, were approximately $21 million in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives; a $22 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative associated with the CHF strategic venture; $24 million of expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities; $18 million of start-up costs for the Donaldsonville ammonia plant; $3 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $2 million of fees associated with the amendment of the private placement notes, partially offset by a $1 million gain on foreign currency derivatives. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $83 million, and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.13. 
Included in these results is a realized loss of $11 million or $0.17 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the third quarter of 2016. Our gross margin per ton of urea and UAN was affected by the commencement of depreciation of our capacity additions at Donaldsonville, which increased depreciation expense in the quarter by $19 million. Including this amount, total depreciation for the quarter amounted to about $83 million for the 2 segments and about $30 per ton and $43 per ton for urea and UAN, respectively. As we bring up the remaining plants, our depreciation will again increase. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $800 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior years, primarily related to the bonus depreciation provision in the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent in part on the timing of the completion of the expansion project at Port Neal. 
The company now projects a 2016 pretax loss, excluding noncontrolling interests. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $131 million on a pretax loss of $131 million. The amount recognized represents the reversal of tax provisions that we recorded in prior periods this year.
Interest expense for the third quarter was $31 million, with another $53 million of interest being capitalized in the quarter. As the capacity expansions are completed, interest capitalization will decrease dramatically, increasing reported interest expense on the income statement.
As you know, CHS is entitled to semiannual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC. The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS but not yet declared for the third quarter of 2016 is approximately $22 million. 
For the full year, the company expects to have total capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.8 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects, and $450 million to $475 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects. The total completed capital cost of all capacity expansion projects, both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, is estimated to be approximately $5.2 billion.
For 2017, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, returning CapEx to maintenance levels that continue our commitment to safe, compliant and reliable operation.
Let's turn now to our liquidity profile and capital structure. As we indicated in the release, due to the uncertain duration of the current low price environment, our company is taking steps to maintain strong liquidity and has made -- and is making certain changes to part of the debt-capital structure to put in place financing more appropriate for the current business and operating environment. As of September 30, 2016, the company had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1.6 billion, an undrawn revolver and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements on all debt instruments. 
In addition to maintaining strong liquidity, our intention is to put in place a capital structure for the business we are as opposed to the business we thought we would be a year ago. We recently obtained required lender consent for an amendment of our revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions that would, among other things, change and add financial covenants, reduce the facility size from $1.5 billion to $750 million and add security interest to provide credit enhancement to the lenders. We believe this security enhancement gave the lenders confidence to give us the appropriate flexibility to continue paying our dividend.
We expect to fund the prepayment of the senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 and the related make-whole amount with the issuance of new long-term secured debt, borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, cash on hand or a combination of any of the foregoing.
As many of you recall, we issued the private placement notes when we were in the middle of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Because of that, we were unable to issue traditional registered investment-grade debt. Instead, we opted to issue private placement notes with longer maturities that were spread out over time to meet our capital needs. However, the private placement covenant package is not appropriate for a stand-alone CF in the current operating environment. The intent of prepaying the private placement notes is to replace them with financing that has a long-term covenant structure more consistent with traditional debt capital for a cyclical industry. 
Before I hand the call back to Tony, I would like to end by discussing our capital allocation philosophy, which has not changed. While the current pricing environment has impacted our ratings in the near term, we remain committed to investment grade over the long term. We will continue our proven approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018 and again in 2020. If you look at our Slide 19, what you will see is that we have returned to shareholders more than twice as much as we have net invested in large projects and assets. 
Looking at Slide 20, you can see that since 2010, our approach has resulted in our shareholders having greatly increased exposure to our underlying business as measured by nitrogen nutrient tons per 1,000 shares. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

As we have tried to lay out in our slides on Pages 22 through 26, we believe CF is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from recovery in the nitrogen sector. Although there is currently oversupply in the industry, global nitrogen demand is expected to continue to grow at roughly 2% per year. There is a lack of new plants scheduled to come online post-2017, and as a result, the global supply-demand balance should tighten, leading to an increase in product prices. As this price recovery begins in 2018 and continues thereafter, CF should benefit disproportionately.
As Page 26 indicates, a $25 per ton urea equivalent increase translates roughly to $350 million of additional EBITDA on an annual basis. Bert indicated that average published Q3 urea prices at NOLA was $180 per ton. However, prices are already $30 to $40 higher than that today. With our new plants starting up and improving market conditions, we are very excited about the future.

We're seeing net [ph] prices increase in Europe, in France as well as other locations and in the United States. So we've seen an activity step-up in North America over the last several weeks and pricing, correspondingly, is increasing. Ammonia, we have not seen the big move yet for fall applications in North America, but we have a pretty positive weather pattern in front of us. And we expect that to go fairly soon. Around the world, I think with the -- on ammonia specifically, with the additions in Asia of the SABIC plant and some of the new capacity that's come online, that did pressure pricing in Q3, but we expect moderating prices on the upside as we roll into 2017."

Over the next year or 2, you're right, there is additional capacity coming online. We expect most of that North American capacity to be converted into upgraded products. And you have 2 new plants coming online that are probably net losses for ammonia. And the current capacity that's come on in the Gulf outside of CF's is pretty much committed to Dyno and Cornerstone and some other movements.

And what we have done, I'll tell you, the rail rates have gone up, and there's been an impact on UAN. And we have met with the railroads, and we continue to do, whether it's spot situations or looking at the complex as a whole. One of the things we did last year was we opened up Stolthaven, which allowed us to get on the NS and bypass some of the blocked activity we believe we were experiencing in Donaldsonville. We've also leveraged and moved up our barge participation on UAN, increasing the level. And then like I mentioned earlier, the exports. And so we're able to achieve a fairly attractive netback, moving our product to all over the globe but principally to Argentina, Uruguay, Europe and some new markets we're developing. And we've been -- we've moved to France for less than $15, $14 a ton. We can't move to St. Louis for that on UAN. And so as you see us develop and grow and mature, we're going to continue to leverage those options and to benefit us. The other opportunities for what we're doing: We've met with the railroads on shipping out of Port Neal. We have UP and BN servicing that plant, but we've built that facility to fully load that product out by truck. And so you have to take defensive measures during these times to be able to position yourselves to pull in the attractive pricing for rail and other logistical options. And that's what we're doing."

And anyone who is in the Port Neal area has seen the flare stack lit up, so we've got gas and steam going into the reformer front end. As we work kind of from the reformer through the CO2 removal system, we're going to start sending CO2 over to the urea plants and then be able to pull ammonia out of the tanks. And so that's what we're planning in terms of the parallel commissioning. So it's very likely that urea will actually be online before the ammonia plant is fully up. It's a simpler plant to commission and granulation is already operational. But our expectation is it's a matter of a couple of weeks, maybe 3 or 4, it depends upon the number of little issues that you find as you go through it. But that was fairly consistent with our experience at Donaldsonville. And hopefully, we'll be able to improve on that because of the great team we've got from D'Ville that's up helping the Port Neal guys.

So we can produce ammonia, urea, UAN and some of the other products. We'll continue to do that and leverage those options up and down as the market necessitates. Then you go into loading options, and so -- where we have pipe, barge, truck, rail, vessel. Then you go next to terminal opportunities and where those terminals are. We have taken on some additional terminaling space, which we believe is in our long-term interest, in markets that we have not necessarily participated as much in the past and we can effectively serve now with our logistical options. But you're right, exports are a great opportunity because you can immediately put 40,000 tons out and load it in a day. And so that's a great leverage point when you're looking at inventory at the plant and how you're moving it out incrementally into the interior. Buying patterns have changed, and we anticipate that they'll probably be this way for another year or so. But at the end of the day, you do have to have your product in place to serve the farmer customer. You can only move so many railcars per day. And the railcars can only make so many trips, and they have to return empty and load out and get in line. And so we believe that as that window closes, and every day is another lost shipment day, that, that will challenge the delivery system. And this is more of a UAN story than it is for urea because I think you can move that out by barge and up through the various terminals. So we're fairly positive looking forward into 2017. We're -- if you really look at it, it protects us in Oklahoma. That'll start applications in February; Midwest, March and then April. So you're not much more than 4 or 5 months away from applications. Even though we're just starting winter, we're already looking to spring.

The point, though, that I'd like to highlight just to remind everybody of, and we've got a slide to this effect in the appendix, but even after all of the new capacity that's in flight to North America comes online, North America is still going to be a very import-dependent region where there's about 30% of our total nitrogen demand has got to be met by imports. So when we're exporting here and there, it really is just around the edges and primarily during periods of time when there isn't a lot going to ground in North America and there's demand in other regions.

And we said that in the -- in our prepared remarks, that basically, those things were taken out in September as part of financing the OCI deal. At the time we did that, we weren't in a position to issue registered debt or even 144A debt because we wouldn't have had the requisite financial information we needed to issue that. And so what we did is we looked at a couple of options. We looked at potentially taking out a 3- or 5-year term loan to provide the financing. And the reason we rejected that option was because, effectively, if you looked at the post-closing of the OCI deal, there would have been, had we done that, around $4 billion worth of maturities occurring between sort of 2016 and 2021. And that was a concentration of maturities that really wasn't -- that was a bit high risk for us. So what we did instead is we went to the private placement market where we could basically throw a lot of those maturities further out to 2025 and also to 2027 so we would have more -- a more laddered effect. Now with the business that we intended to have coming out of that deal, which would have included 3 new operating plants and through time, significantly less debt and also the operating environment that we foresaw at that time, the covenant structure in the private placement notes was not perceived to be problematic. But a couple of things happened since that point in time: a, we didn't do the CHS -- we didn't do the OCI deal and so that we never got the 3 additional operating plants. In addition to that and certainly with respect to third quarter, things turned out a bit more adverse than we had anticipated. And so what that highlighted to us was the need to make sure that, with respect to our long-dated capital, that the long-dated capital that we had in place to finance the business should be long-dated capital that is consistent with a business that is cyclical and goes through ups and downs and is robust to that from a covenant perspective. And the reason that that's important to us is because having a more appropriate set of covenants gives us the flexibility, as I said, with respect to the revolving credit facility to continue to pay the dividend and do other things on the equity side that would be more difficult otherwise. And so the actions that we're taking here are really around reducing the risk and uncertainty around that sort of stuff and putting our capital structure in a framework that's far more appropriate for the type of business that we are today and the environment we're in."

The Port Neal ammonia plant is a lot less complex than the Port Neal plant is -- or Port Neal's less complex than D'Ville because Port Neal is a 2,200-ton a day plant where D'Ville is a 3,300. And the configuration of the syn-loop in Donaldsonville is much more complex. There's a whole another [ph] section to it. So as we look at this, we feel very comfortable in terms of being able to get the plant online here by the end of the year, and that's why we continue to say $800 million in terms of the tax refund next year because we expect to get everything online."

The timing of the refund has to do with when you get your tax return in and when that gets processed through. And given what we anticipate today -- or what we see today, we anticipate that, that will be a third quarter event next year, that is, the refund. As Tony described to you, the Port Neal piece has to do with the amount because it's what drives ultimately for a portion of our depreciation, whether you have depreciation in your tax loss for '16 that you carry back or whether you don't and how much. And like Tony said, it's not an all-or-nothing type thing. There's a sort of a continuum of outcomes, but our strong expectation remains that we'll be fully depreciating those assets this year."

It is the vertical axis is our realized price, but I think the -- in the third quarter, the published average NOLA price was $180, and our realized price was a little over $200. And so that -- we would expect that spread to go up once Port Neal comes online because we're adding about 1.4 million tons in-market that's going to have a $30, $40 a ton premium associated with it because that's the transportation cost from the Gulf. And so we're -- that kind of gives you a general sense of kind of the premium to the Gulf that we would expect. In addition, although ammonia is a little bit different animal because of the volume that's available out there in the deepwater market, we would expect UAN premium to come back in line with urea, and we can switch back and forth between granulating more or producing more solutions, depending upon where that premium sits and to the extent that you don't get the corresponding bump that you would expect in UAN, we'll just shift the product mix. So I think over the medium to long term, those things have to come back into rough kind of equilibrium. Otherwise, the producers shift the mix and the end values have to trade sort of at a minimum on parity with, very likely, UAN continuing to command a premium the way it has."

So in the -- when we mentioned the weakness, it's more of the weakness in the ammonia price structure and why that was driven more in relation to the contractual structure of our industrial book of business, which is gas based as well as Tampa based, and Tampa is very low. Demand has been a little bit lower in the Industrial segment due to some of the issues around caprolactam and phosphate. I think this is just more of additional phosphate exports out of China has put a little more pressure on some of the other phosphate producers in terms of overall volumes, and possible changes in mix as moving some to micronutrients, as Mosaic has mentioned, away from, possibly, DAP. So weakness, it's just I don't think it's anything we're concerned about, and we're -- our volumes are, we think, going to hold steady. Regarding DEF, we're very -- more positive with what's going on in the DEF market, continued demand. We're going to have a record year on DEF volume. Pricing is holding up. We're continuing to see the growth of the 30% to 40% that we have seen year-on-year. I do think that, just due to this slight slowdown in shipments. You have probably seen the Class 8 truck volume -- the new truck volume slowing down a little bit on that end, but you do have additional demand coming from off-road as well as different segments. So we're positive on the DEF front and continue to invest and grow and build the team and participate in that business."

In order to be able to get ammonia into the farmer's fields, you have to have a place to move it to. And it's not like urea where you can just leave it on a railcar, put it in a shed kind of thing. In UAN, there's a lot of availability of tank space. With ammonia, you got -- you have to have the big cryogenic storage tanks. And there's principally only 3 companies, and they're the producers, that own those. CF has got the largest network of the ammonia tank terminal system. Coke has got some, and Agrium has got some. And then there's kind of onesie-twosie tanks here and there that are owned by other people like Trammo and so forth. But if you don't have the storage terminals, then you can't take Gulf ammonia up into the marketplace and get it in the hands of the farmers because you've got no place to move it through. And so even though there is some impact in terms of agricultural demand or agricultural prices for ammonia, it's not directly tied to Tampa ammonia the way urea price in the Midwest is tied to NOLA urea price. So there -- that's one of the reasons why the discount, usually, in the terminal system that we have got in ammonia is so valuable because it allows us to capture a pretty sizable spread between the value of agricultural ammonia versus cheap -- relatively cheap deepwater ammonia."

In limited applications, we see that drying out and temperatures staying in the 50s in the afternoon, allowing, probably, the applications to accelerate. And when you look at, as a farmer, for corn, you have a number of options for an application thereof. For ammonia, traditionally, in the past, it was 180 pounds per acre. You put it on in the fall, and you plant it in the spring, and off you go. That has changed with different agronomic prescriptions. And so we have seen a little bit less applied in the fall and then a pick-up in additional application in the spring, 2, 3 and 4 stage applications, a combination of ammonia, maybe side-dress ammonia or UAN, UAN top-dress or even flying over with urea. Each of those are positive for us. And so we do see ammonia in the fall as a component to good agronomic corn practices, and we see that continuing."

The issue is all around, in the near term, the pricing environment and the EBITDA generation relative to the aggregate amount of debt that we've got outstanding on the business. And so change the dividend, don't change the dividend, it doesn't have a meaningful impact in terms of that particular metric. And that's why we've worked really hard on the secured credit facility to make sure that we've got the flexibility that allows us to continue paying the dividend going forward because that's an important element for the equity holders. And so our focus is to get back to investment grade, and we are planning, as Dennis articulated earlier, to retire the debt that comes due 2018. That's $800 million.

22357184,404826550,1074049,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account t",906,"Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release. The third quarter typically has our lowest volumes and lowest realized prices of the year, and this year was no different. 
The nitrogen cost curve has widened and flattened, pressuring product prices, as a significant amount of new capacity has come online globally. As capacity was increasing, the cost to produce and move nitrogen into market was decreasing due to lower feedstock and ocean freight costs and currency devaluations in certain production regions. 
In addition to low product prices and already seasonally low volume, the situation was exacerbated by a change in buyer behavior. The North American value chain delayed purchasing products, given the reluctance to take inventory risk as the application season was still several months away, and additional new capacity, including our own, will soon be online. As such, the channel largely took a wait-and-see approach to the quarter. The net result was sluggish demand in North America and nitrogen product prices that fell to multiyear lows and were often trading below international parity. Bert will discuss this in more detail, including the moves we made in response to these conditions. 
The business generated $83 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter despite the challenging market conditions. A welcome new development has been the strengthening market conditions of late. Both sales volume and product prices have increased since the end of the quarter as buyers are finally moving off the sidelines and beginning to prepare for the application season. 
On our last call, we detailed plans to deal with difficult market conditions that are expected to persist through next year. Our continuing focus is safe, reliable operations; reducing our costs and capital expenditures; and maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $1.5 billion in cash and an undrawn revolver. Additionally, we expect to receive roughly $800 million in cash via tax refund in the third quarter next year, which is almost $3.50 per share. So we have the strong liquidity position we desire.
We have also made great progress in reducing both SG&A and direct manufacturing costs. In addition to our efforts to reduce costs and conserve cash, we highlighted our focus to complete the major capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have done just that. As we announced in October, the new ammonia plant is online and producing. With the new ammonia, urea and UAN plants all running at or above nameplate capacity, the expansion project at Donaldsonville has been officially completed. 
At Port Neal, we are in the process of starting up the plant. We had a successful test run of the urea granulation plant in September, and gas and steam have been introduced into the ammonia plant, and we're proceeding with the urea plant start-up in parallel. As a result, we expect both ammonia and urea production at Port Neal to begin soon. 
To help make this happen, we have brought a seasoned team from Donaldsonville up to assist the Port Neal final commissioning and start-up of the plants, allowing us to leverage what we've learned from our experiences. With the completion of Donaldsonville and with Port Neal starting up, now is a good time to take a step back and assess the good and bad of the capacity expansion projects. 
I want to start by referring to Slide 11 of the materials posted to our website. The total capital cost to build the new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal was $5.2 billion. Those plants are expected to produce roughly 4 million product tons per year. However, CHS paid $2.8 billion and have the rights to 1.7 million tons of that production. So that leaves $2.4 billion of capital and roughly 2.3 million product tons for CF's account. Therefore, our resulting net capital cost was roughly $1,050 per product ton of new capacity. 
As Page 13 suggests, while our costs have greatly exceeded our initial estimate and we're certainly not happy about that, it is an all too common occurrence in the industry as every major North American project we could find reliable data on has similarly experienced significant cost overruns as well. What is ultimately important, though, is the capital cost per ton of new production capacity. 
As shown on Page 13, our new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal have an effective capital cost per ton of production that is among the lowest of all the observable plants built recently in North America. And what is really important, as detailed on Page 14, is that the effective IRR for the projects remains significantly above our cost of capital despite the increased costs and lower product price environment. The net result of all of this is that we remain pretty happy with our decision to do the capacity expansion projects and the fact that we sold an equity interest to CHS. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bert who will talk more about the market and our outlook in more detail, and then Dennis will discuss our performance and our work on reshaping part of our debt capital structure, after which I will offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

The supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen pr",1066,"Thanks, Tony. The supply-driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen prices at the U.S. Gulf remained below international parity for most of the third quarter, as Tony mentioned. Even as of late last week, NOLA urea is trading at approximately $10 per short ton below the rest of the world. 
The global oversupply of nitrogen and its pressure on prices is not a new story. As we have said before, we believe 2016 represents the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally, with capacity additions projected to drop off sharply after mid-2017. As an industry, we have yet to see the full impact of the new North American production capacity, but that which has come online has begun to displace imports.
The low global prices have challenged the ability of high-cost producers to operate. The marginal producer, which remains Chinese anthracite coal plants, have also seen production and transportation costs rise. Rail and trucking costs in China have increased, and electricity subsidies for small urea producers were eliminated in April. Additionally, coal prices have increased due to government-imposed mining restrictions. 
Anthracite lump coal prices in China had been flat for most of the third quarter, but recent published reports suggest that prices have increased 20% to 30%. This has translated to additional plants in China shutting down and fewer Chinese product being offered in the international marketplace via exports. Through the end of the quarter, approximately 8 million metric tons of annual urea capacity has been shut down in China, and we anticipate that number to continue to increase. 
This fundamental economic pressure is affecting pricing. The Chinese port price per metric ton for urea had risen to about $220 as we enter November, up from $194 per metric ton at the end of September. Also, the average U.S. Gulf price for urea barged product was approximately $180 per short ton for the third quarter, and today, it is $30 to $40 higher. We anticipate that prices in the coming quarters will also be supported by stronger demand. 
During the low price environment of the third quarter, customers took a new approach to purchases. While the third quarter typically has the lowest prices and lowest volumes in North America, demand was pressured more than normal. The trend of lower prices over the last 18 months has increased inventory risk in the mind of the purchaser. Over the last 10 years, customers have purchased forward, received the product out of season as inventory and then delivered the product to their customers for either fall or spring applications. 
Today, this is much less the case. Many domestic customers told us they did not want to purchase product in the third quarter, preferring instead to take a wait-and-see approach to understand how the market will develop, particularly with new capacity expected to come online in North America. This approach was a deviation from historical purchasing patterns, but we responded to this environment in a few specific ways. 
First, we delayed the launch of our UAN fill program, and we capitalized on our flexibility to export from Donaldsonville, particularly for UAN. Our sales team has put in a great deal of work in recent years to open up new markets for our product, and that effort is benefiting the company now. In the third quarter, we exported a record amount of UAN for the first 9 months of the year. The UAN exports have increased 143% over the same period last year and have risen from under 100,000 tons in 2012 to more than 700,000 tons year-to-date in 2016.
We have also increased shipments of UAN to the East and Gulf Coasts by way of a new vessel commissioned earlier this year, allowing CF to compete with imports. In the past, we have not participated in these regions in a significant way as farmers in the Corn Belt consumed the vast majority of our UAN and cost-effective freight options were limited. 
We also have a significant amount of in-market storage for our products, with over 1.2 million tons of ammonia storage, 1.3 million tons of UAN and over 500,000 tons of urea storage across our network. Even if buyers sat for a while on the sideline, historically, we have been able to fully operate our plants and position product for when demand materializes. 
As I've said many times, nitrogen is a necessary nutrient. It has to be applied every year. Additionally, despite the record or near-record corn and soybean crops expected this year, 2017 futures prices suggest continued profitability at the farm level for corn and soybeans. We are forecasting 88 million acres of corn and for wheat acres to remain flat at 50 million acres. Assuming that the weather cooperates, when demand for fall application season begins, we expect it to be strong. 
At the same time, we believe that North American downstream inventory of ammonia, urea and UAN is low following the spring application season. Urea imports were down 55% year-over-year in the third quarter as well, suggesting that purchasing activity will have to accelerate to be ready for spring. With buyers holding off purchases, we expect there to be robust, just-in-time demand during the application season, which, as I've outlined, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
We've also seen tremendous progress in our U.K. operations. Since CF purchased the plants at Ince and Billingham, the manufacturing teams have set a number of production records. The team there also delivered a record amount of fertilizer to U.K. farmers in July as their season began, and they continue to move all of their product. We've also benefited from a continued decline in U.K. natural gas prices, which had an average price in the third quarter of 2016 of $4.08 per MMBtu compared to $6.44 per MMBtu in the same quarter of 2015.
For the North American natural gas market, the December NYMEX contracts started the quarter near $3.36 per MMBtu and is currently trading at around $2.79 per MMBtu. During the third quarter of 2016, we did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for low-cost North American natural gas. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis."

In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13.

In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13. Included in these results, on a pretax basis, were approximately $21 million in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives; a $22 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative associated with the CHF strategic venture; $24 million of expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities; $18 million of start-up costs for the Donaldsonville ammonia plant; $3 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans; and $2 million of fees associated with the amendment of the private placement notes, partially offset by a $1 million gain on foreign currency derivatives. When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $83 million, and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.13. 
Included in these results is a realized loss of $11 million or $0.17 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the third quarter of 2016. Our gross margin per ton of urea and UAN was affected by the commencement of depreciation of our capacity additions at Donaldsonville, which increased depreciation expense in the quarter by $19 million. Including this amount, total depreciation for the quarter amounted to about $83 million for the 2 segments and about $30 per ton and $43 per ton for urea and UAN, respectively. As we bring up the remaining plants, our depreciation will again increase. 
In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $800 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior years, primarily related to the bonus depreciation provision in the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent in part on the timing of the completion of the expansion project at Port Neal. 
The company now projects a 2016 pretax loss, excluding noncontrolling interests. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $131 million on a pretax loss of $131 million. The amount recognized represents the reversal of tax provisions that we recorded in prior periods this year.
Interest expense for the third quarter was $31 million, with another $53 million of interest being capitalized in the quarter. As the capacity expansions are completed, interest capitalization will decrease dramatically, increasing reported interest expense on the income statement.
As you know, CHS is entitled to semiannual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC. The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS but not yet declared for the third quarter of 2016 is approximately $22 million. 
For the full year, the company expects to have total capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.8 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects, and $450 million to $475 million will be for sustaining, improvement and other projects. The total completed capital cost of all capacity expansion projects, both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, is estimated to be approximately $5.2 billion.
For 2017, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, returning CapEx to maintenance levels that continue our commitment to safe, compliant and reliable operation.
Let's turn now to our liquidity profile and capital structure. As we indicated in the release, due to the uncertain duration of the current low price environment, our company is taking steps to maintain strong liquidity and has made -- and is making certain changes to part of the debt-capital structure to put in place financing more appropriate for the current business and operating environment. As of September 30, 2016, the company had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1.6 billion, an undrawn revolver and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements on all debt instruments. 
In addition to maintaining strong liquidity, our intention is to put in place a capital structure for the business we are as opposed to the business we thought we would be a year ago. We recently obtained required lender consent for an amendment of our revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions that would, among other things, change and add financial covenants, reduce the facility size from $1.5 billion to $750 million and add security interest to provide credit enhancement to the lenders. We believe this security enhancement gave the lenders confidence to give us the appropriate flexibility to continue paying our dividend.
We expect to fund the prepayment of the senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 and the related make-whole amount with the issuance of new long-term secured debt, borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, cash on hand or a combination of any of the foregoing.
As many of you recall, we issued the private placement notes when we were in the middle of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Because of that, we were unable to issue traditional registered investment-grade debt. Instead, we opted to issue private placement notes with longer maturities that were spread out over time to meet our capital needs. However, the private placement covenant package is not appropriate for a stand-alone CF in the current operating environment. The intent of prepaying the private placement notes is to replace them with financing that has a long-term covenant structure more consistent with traditional debt capital for a cyclical industry. 
Before I hand the call back to Tony, I would like to end by discussing our capital allocation philosophy, which has not changed. While the current pricing environment has impacted our ratings in the near term, we remain committed to investment grade over the long term. We will continue our proven approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018 and again in 2020. If you look at our Slide 19, what you will see is that we have returned to shareholders more than twice as much as we have net invested in large projects and assets. 
Looking at Slide 20, you can see that since 2010, our approach has resulted in our shareholders having greatly increased exposure to our underlying business as measured by nitrogen nutrient tons per 1,000 shares. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

As we have tried to lay out in our slides on Pages 22 through 26, we believe CF is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from recovery in the nitrogen sector. Although there is currently oversupply in the industry, global nitrogen demand is expected to continue to grow at roughly 2% per year. There is a lack of new plants scheduled to come online post-2017, and as a result, the global supply-demand balance should tighten, leading to an increase in product prices. As this price recovery begins in 2018 and continues thereafter, CF should benefit disproportionately.
As Page 26 indicates, a $25 per ton urea equivalent increase translates roughly to $350 million of additional EBITDA on an annual basis. Bert indicated that average published Q3 urea prices at NOLA was $180 per ton. However, prices are already $30 to $40 higher than that today. With our new plants starting up and improving market conditions, we are very excited about the future. 
With that, operator, we'll open the call to questions."

Over the next year or 2, you're right, there is additional capacity coming online. We expect most of that North American capacity to be converted into upgraded products. And you have 2 new plants coming online that are probably net losses for ammonia. And the current capacity that's come on in the Gulf outside of CF's is pretty much committed to Dyno and Cornerstone and some other movements.

And what we have done, I'll tell you, the rail rates have gone up, and there's been an impact on UAN. And we have met with the railroads, and we continue to do, whether it's spot situations or looking at the complex as a whole. One of the things we did last year was we opened up Stolthaven, which allowed us to get on the NS and bypass some of the blocked activity we believe we were experiencing in Donaldsonville. We've also leveraged and moved up our barge participation on UAN, increasing the level. And then like I mentioned earlier, the exports. And so we're able to achieve a fairly attractive netback, moving our product to all over the globe but principally to Argentina, Uruguay, Europe and some new markets we're developing. And we've been -- we've moved to France for less than $15, $14 a ton. We can't move to St. Louis for that on UAN. And so as you see us develop and grow and mature, we're going to continue to leverage those options and to benefit us. The other opportunities for what we're doing: We've met with the railroads on shipping out of Port Neal. We have UP and BN servicing that plant, but we've built that facility to fully load that product out by truck. And so you have to take defensive measures during these times to be able to position yourselves to pull in the attractive pricing for rail and other logistical options. And that's what we're doing."

And anyone who is in the Port Neal area has seen the flare stack lit up, so we've got gas and steam going into the reformer front end. As we work kind of from the reformer through the CO2 removal system, we're going to start sending CO2 over to the urea plants and then be able to pull ammonia out of the tanks. And so that's what we're planning in terms of the parallel commissioning. So it's very likely that urea will actually be online before the ammonia plant is fully up. It's a simpler plant to commission and granulation is already operational. But our expectation is it's a matter of a couple of weeks, maybe 3 or 4, it depends upon the number of little issues that you find as you go through it. But that was fairly consistent with our experience at Donaldsonville. And hopefully, we'll be able to improve on that because of the great team we've got from D'Ville that's up helping the Port Neal guys.

So we can produce ammonia, urea, UAN and some of the other products. We'll continue to do that and leverage those options up and down as the market necessitates. Then you go into loading options, and so -- where we have pipe, barge, truck, rail, vessel. Then you go next to terminal opportunities and where those terminals are. We have taken on some additional terminaling space, which we believe is in our long-term interest, in markets that we have not necessarily participated as much in the past and we can effectively serve now with our logistical options. But you're right, exports are a great opportunity because you can immediately put 40,000 tons out and load it in a day. And so that's a great leverage point when you're looking at inventory at the plant and how you're moving it out incrementally into the interior. Buying patterns have changed, and we anticipate that they'll probably be this way for another year or so. But at the end of the day, you do have to have your product in place to serve the farmer customer. You can only move so many railcars per day. And the railcars can only make so many trips, and they have to return empty and load out and get in line. And so we believe that as that window closes, and every day is another lost shipment day, that, that will challenge the delivery system. And this is more of a UAN story than it is for urea because I think you can move that out by barge and up through the various terminals. So we're fairly positive looking forward into 2017. We're -- if you really look at it, it protects us in Oklahoma. That'll start applications in February; Midwest, March and then April. So you're not much more than 4 or 5 months away from applications. Even though we're just starting winter, we're already looking to spring.

The point, though, that I'd like to highlight just to remind everybody of, and we've got a slide to this effect in the appendix, but even after all of the new capacity that's in flight to North America comes online, North America is still going to be a very import-dependent region where there's about 30% of our total nitrogen demand has got to be met by imports. So when we're exporting here and there, it really is just around the edges and primarily during periods of time when there isn't a lot going to ground in North America and there's demand in other regions. So it's a way to maximize overall system netbacks, not a have-to-do kind of thing."

And we said that in the -- in our prepared remarks, that basically, those things were taken out in September as part of financing the OCI deal. At the time we did that, we weren't in a position to issue registered debt or even 144A debt because we wouldn't have had the requisite financial information we needed to issue that. And so what we did is we looked at a couple of options. We looked at potentially taking out a 3- or 5-year term loan to provide the financing. And the reason we rejected that option was because, effectively, if you looked at the post-closing of the OCI deal, there would have been, had we done that, around $4 billion worth of maturities occurring between sort of 2016 and 2021. And that was a concentration of maturities that really wasn't -- that was a bit high risk for us. So what we did instead is we went to the private placement market where we could basically throw a lot of those maturities further out to 2025 and also to 2027 so we would have more -- a more laddered effect. Now with the business that we intended to have coming out of that deal, which would have included 3 new operating plants and through time, significantly less debt and also the operating environment that we foresaw at that time, the covenant structure in the private placement notes was not perceived to be problematic. But a couple of things happened since that point in time: a, we didn't do the CHS -- we didn't do the OCI deal and so that we never got the 3 additional operating plants. In addition to that and certainly with respect to third quarter, things turned out a bit more adverse than we had anticipated. And so what that highlighted to us was the need to make sure that, with respect to our long-dated capital, that the long-dated capital that we had in place to finance the business should be long-dated capital that is consistent with a business that is cyclical and goes through ups and downs and is robust to that from a covenant perspective. And the reason that that's important to us is because having a more appropriate set of covenants gives us the flexibility, as I said, with respect to the revolving credit facility to continue to pay the dividend and do other things on the equity side that would be more difficult otherwise. And so the actions that we're taking here are really around reducing the risk and uncertainty around that sort of stuff and putting our capital structure in a framework that's far more appropriate for the type of business that we are today and the environment we're in."

We're ready to put CO2 into the urea melt plant, the synthesis plant and kind of get that up and running. The off-sites have all been sort of tested and are operational and once we've got CO2 going over to the urea plant, then the front end of the ammonia plant is operational. So again, this isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing. We're putting sections of the plant in operation as we go. But again, our expectation here is based on our experience at Donaldsonville, the urea plants are sister plants from one another, and the one at D'Ville started up within a week. So we think we got plenty of time to get it up and operational. The Port Neal ammonia plant is a lot less complex than the Port Neal plant is -- or Port Neal's less complex than D'Ville because Port Neal is a 2,200-ton a day plant where D'Ville is a 3,300. And the configuration of the syn-loop in Donaldsonville is much more complex. There's a whole another [ph] section to it.

And given what we anticipate today -- or what we see today, we anticipate that, that will be a third quarter event next year, that is, the refund. As Tony described to you, the Port Neal piece has to do with the amount because it's what drives ultimately for a portion of our depreciation, whether you have depreciation in your tax loss for '16 that you carry back or whether you don't and how much. And like Tony said, it's not an all-or-nothing type thing. There's a sort of a continuum of outcomes, but our strong expectation remains that we'll be fully depreciating those assets this year."

And if there are differences going forward, that's going to change. It is the vertical axis is our realized price, but I think the -- in the third quarter, the published average NOLA price was $180, and our realized price was a little over $200. And so that -- we would expect that spread to go up once Port Neal comes online because we're adding about 1.4 million tons in-market that's going to have a $30, $40 a ton premium associated with it because that's the transportation cost from the Gulf. And so we're -- that kind of gives you a general sense of kind of the premium to the Gulf that we would expect. In addition, although ammonia is a little bit different animal because of the volume that's available out there in the deepwater market, we would expect UAN premium to come back in line with urea, and we can switch back and forth between granulating more or producing more solutions, depending upon where that premium sits and to the extent that you don't get the corresponding bump that you would expect in UAN, we'll just shift the product mix. So I think over the medium to long term, those things have to come back into rough kind of equilibrium. Otherwise, the producers shift the mix and the end values have to trade sort of at a minimum on parity with, very likely, UAN continuing to command a premium the way it has."

So in the -- when we mentioned the weakness, it's more of the weakness in the ammonia price structure and why that was driven more in relation to the contractual structure of our industrial book of business, which is gas based as well as Tampa based, and Tampa is very low. Demand has been a little bit lower in the Industrial segment due to some of the issues around caprolactam and phosphate. I think this is just more of additional phosphate exports out of China has put a little more pressure on some of the other phosphate producers in terms of overall volumes, and possible changes in mix as moving some to micronutrients, as Mosaic has mentioned, away from, possibly, DAP. So weakness, it's just I don't think it's anything we're concerned about, and we're -- our volumes are, we think, going to hold steady. Regarding DEF, we're very -- more positive with what's going on in the DEF market, continued demand. We're going to have a record year on DEF volume. Pricing is holding up. We're continuing to see the growth of the 30% to 40% that we have seen year-on-year. I do think that, just due to this slight slowdown in shipments. You have probably seen the Class 8 truck volume -- the new truck volume slowing down a little bit on that end, but you do have additional demand coming from off-road as well as different segments. So we're positive on the DEF front and continue to invest and grow and build the team and participate in that business."

In order to be able to get ammonia into the farmer's fields, you have to have a place to move it to. And it's not like urea where you can just leave it on a railcar, put it in a shed kind of thing. In UAN, there's a lot of availability of tank space. With ammonia, you got -- you have to have the big cryogenic storage tanks. And there's principally only 3 companies, and they're the producers, that own those. CF has got the largest network of the ammonia tank terminal system. Coke has got some, and Agrium has got some. And then there's kind of onesie-twosie tanks here and there that are owned by other people like Trammo and so forth. But if you don't have the storage terminals, then you can't take Gulf ammonia up into the marketplace and get it in the hands of the farmers because you've got no place to move it through. And so even though there is some impact in terms of agricultural demand or agricultural prices for ammonia, it's not directly tied to Tampa ammonia the way urea price in the Midwest is tied to NOLA urea price. So there -- that's one of the reasons why the discount, usually, in the terminal system that we have got in ammonia is so valuable because it allows us to capture a pretty sizable spread between the value of agricultural ammonia versus cheap -- relatively cheap deepwater ammonia."

In limited applications, we see that drying out and temperatures staying in the 50s in the afternoon, allowing, probably, the applications to accelerate. And when you look at, as a farmer, for corn, you have a number of options for an application thereof. For ammonia, traditionally, in the past, it was 180 pounds per acre. You put it on in the fall, and you plant it in the spring, and off you go. That has changed with different agronomic prescriptions. And so we have seen a little bit less applied in the fall and then a pick-up in additional application in the spring, 2, 3 and 4 stage applications, a combination of ammonia, maybe side-dress ammonia or UAN, UAN top-dress or even flying over with urea. Each of those are positive for us. And so we do see ammonia in the fall as a component to good agronomic corn practices, and we see that continuing."
