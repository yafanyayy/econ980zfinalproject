We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial measures for the year.

We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial measures for the year. These strong results were in spite a Q4 revenue that was a bit light versus expectations, driven primarily by delays in EMV card personalization and lower-than-planned license revenue. 
Overall, performance in the second half of '15 was solid, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. These growth results, combined with record fourth quarter sales, should set the stage to expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016. The organization achieved an unprecedented 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. In the process, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grew adjusted operating income by 8% and broke $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time.
We anticipate stronger else again in 2016. We provided internal revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, consistent with our strategic objective of stepping up our growth rate an average of 50 to 100 basis points per year. We also expect in the year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a record level of free cash flow per share. 
As you saw in January 20, we announced the acquisition of certain digital banking and payment assets of the Community Financial Services business from ACI Worldwide. These complementary solutions are strategically aligned with our goal of enabling clients to transform their financial services experience. In addition to technology solutions, we will also welcome a group of high-quality clients and committed associates. We expect this transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, to close towards the end of the first quarter. We estimate the purchase price, including the tax benefits and run rate synergies to be right around 5x EBITDA. We will supply additional financial information after the transaction closes.
At the beginning of the year, we established 3 key priorities to help you assess our performance which were: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Reported internal revenue growth of 4% for the year was short of our guidance as we could not overcome the revenue delay resulting from the unanticipated impact of the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization we mentioned in Q3. Fought [ph] for that negative impact, internal revenue growth for the full year would have been 5%. We saw good growth across many of our recurring revenue businesses such as card services, biller solutions, digital channels and account processing. Importantly, we continue to build our capabilities to steadily accelerate our internal revenue growth rate into the future. These areas of high-quality revenue growth, combined with our focus on operational efficiency, drove strong adjusted operating income growth of 8% and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Full year adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, which was $0.04 above the top end of our original guidance, and we achieved a record $4.23 in free cash flow per share. We again demonstrated the strength of our business model and like our trajectory going into 2016.
Our second priority was to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. January marked the 3-year anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition. By any measure, this transaction has been successful. Adding a modern, innovative account processing technology solution, talented associates and a passionate client base. To date, we signed 75 DNA clients and delivered substantial value to the existing client base through high-quality add-on solutions. For the year, 28 new DNA clients went live, including 9 financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, and of the 9, 6 went live in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that these recent implementations, along with the planned 2016 activity, will progressively increase revenue throughout this year.
We added a number of privilege client relationships across multiple account processing platforms in the quarter. For example, United Nations Federal Credit Union, the 28th largest credit union in the U.S, with approximately $4.3 billion in assets, selected DNA along with a suite of integrated solutions to serve its more than 115,000 members located in 200 nations and territories around the world. Suffolk County National Bank with assets nearing $2 billion selected the premier account processing platform, along with a full suite of payment and channel solutions including retail and business online, Mobiliti, bill payment, Popmoney and source capture. By selecting Fiserv as a single provider of these services, these clients expect to amplify their technology streamline operations and enhance their client's experience.
In addition to new clients, we remained focused on deepening existing relationships with an emphasis in our payment and channel solutions. Our integrated debit and credit value propositions continue to resonate well. And in fact, we added nearly 50 new debit clients in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, we contracted to add more than 700 payment solutions across card services, bill payment and Popmoney. In addition, we've signed more than 260 institutions for our new CardValet solution which provides value with the intersection of mobile experience in card payments. We added 43%, more than 1.2 million subscribers, to end the year with over 4 million users on Mobiliti ASP. We have several important Mobiliti releases queued up this year which should enhance functionality and extend user engagement. We also continue to gain momentum with Mobiliti Business. This solution, in its inaugural year, added 60 clients in the quarter and we now have more than 100 businesses live with thousands of underlying users.
Our third priority in 2015 was to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. At our Investor Conference in June, we highlighted 6 of our innovation-based solutions: Agiliti, Mobiliti, DNA, EMV, Now and IPS, that together form an important part of our internal revenue growth acceleration story. We exited the year with our thesis and cap and continue to expect sequential growth rate increases in the 2016 to 2019 period.
During the year, we expanded the breadth of our Popmoney network through business disbursements and charitable giving. During the quarter, we signed a payment agreement with Care, one of the leading humanitarian organizations in the world to accept donations using Popmoney. Through this relationship, millions of consumers will now have the option to use Popmoney to make the world a better place one payment at a time. 
One of our newest in market innovations immediate funds gained important traction in the quarter. This solution enables financial seditions the option of providing consumers real time access to deposited funds across the channel of their choice. Even after signing our first top 10 bank to immediate funds in the quarter, the pipeline remains strong for this real-time, right-now solution. 
Client focus on EMV remains heightened and activity levels are increasing. Card manufacturing accelerated again this quarter and backlog's building. We have a much better line of sight into EMV manufacturing and personalization activity going into 2016. Accordingly, we expect strong EMV growth with volume nearing our expected peaks in the middle quarters of the year. 
We signed our second client to Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution in the fourth quarter. Camden [ph] Bank, a de novo institution, selected Agiliti paired with our Mobiliti solution to bring its unique digital banking experience to the market later this year. In January, Cornerstone Mutual Services signed with Agiliti as a banking platform for the U.K. credit union expansion project, with plans to initially migrate up to 40 U.K. credit unions in 2016. Our Agiliti pipeline remains strong as we head into the year.
Finally, we closed a very small biller solutions acquisition in January, buying Hewlett-Packard's enterprises convenience pay services business. This expands our biller footprint to a modern SaaS platform enabling electronic payment acceptance for a broad range of billers. We anticipate the business would generate roughly 1/2 of 1% of total revenue and that the synergy adjusted net purchase price multiple will be around 3x EBITDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on din our financial results."
128209,321213931,925004,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 points, res",1178,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 points, respectively, of combined negative impact from FX and the unanticipated EMV card personalization delays. Our full year internal revenue growth rate would have been 5% excluding the unanticipated impact of these items. 
Our revenue for the year is a tale of 2 cities as our processing and services recurring revenue increased 5% even after the negative currency impact. On the other hand, product revenue was short of plan for the year and declined compared to 2014 due primarily to lower-than-anticipated base and EMV revenue in our Output Solutions business and lowered-than-planned license revenue for the year. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue, which is key to our long-term growth profile. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 12% over the prior year to $1. Full year adjusted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our original guidance range, growing 15% to $3.87.
Full year adjusted operating margin performance was up a very strong 120 basis points to 31.7%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, expense discipline and a continued focus on Operational Effectiveness. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 30.7%, with comparisons negatively impacted by the timing of our fall client conference, revenue mix and higher expenses in our corporate segment, which by itself, negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points in the quarter. 
At the segment level, our Payments Businesses delivered 6% internal revenue growth in the quarter and 5% for the full year. Growth was primarily led by our card services, biller and channels businesses. Our Output Solutions business saw a base business momentum in the fourth quarter and EMV demand was strong as we had anticipated. A longer lag between manufacturing and personalization of EMV cards led to an additional $7 million revenue deferral in the quarter on top of the $9 million in the third quarter. Our clients purchased a large amount of manufactured EMV card product in 2015, which has not yet been rolled out to their customers. Given visibility and demand, we anticipate that EMV revenue will accelerate substantially into 2016, as our clients move forward with the final card personalization and distribute the EMV cards to consumers.
We again leveraged the power of our integrated card value proposition and finished the year with a very strong sales quarter, signing 49 new debit clients and a total of nearly 150 for the year. Debit transactions continue to grow above markets with high single-digit growth for the year. Our industry-leading bill payment and person-to-person payment solutions continue to grow. For the year, bill payment transactions grew in the low single digits and Popmoney transactions were up over 20%. In Q4, we delivered the first relief supporting our integrated payment strategy, or IPS, which warrants a new, integrated bill payment, P2P and transfer experience. The early returns are encouraging as we expect further growth from these payment transactions in 2016 and over the next several years. 
As Jeff mentioned, Mobiliti ASP users were up sharply year-over-year gaining over 40% and crossing the 4 million subscriber threshold. We continue to believe digital transformation is forging a long runway for revenue growth in both digital subscribers and transaction services. 
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter to $224 million, and for the year was up 9% to $840 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 33.6% and was up 130 basis points to 33% for the year. This strong performance is driven by high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency even as we continue to invest in targeted elevation. 
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $631 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. This solid performance, which includes a negative currency impact of 60 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the year, was led by our card processing and lending businesses. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million in the quarter and $826 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was pressured by the timing of expenses, including our fall client conference and business mix in the quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin was excellent, up 120 basis points driven by growth in our scale businesses such as account processing and the benefit of our Operational Effectiveness initiatives.
Corporate segment net adjusted operating performance in the quarter was in line sequentially, but up over the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and an increase in certain consulting expenses. This year-over-year increase in expense reduced overall company operating margin in the quarter by 50 basis points.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 34.6% in both the quarter and year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than expected due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit, offset by the timing of other discrete tax items. Our effective adjusted tax rate was up 60 basis points for the full year due to lower discrete tax benefits in 2015 than the prior year, which equates to about a 1% or $0.04 per share negative impact on this year's adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 35% in 2016.
We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Free cash flow per share increased 11% to $4.23, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $3.87. We believe the combined benefits of focus at high-quality revenue, along with disciplined capital allocation, will continue to reduce excellent free cash flow per share results.
We received $36 million of cash distributions from our Stone River joint venture in 2015, which are substantially excluded from our free cash flow results. In January, we received an additional $140 million distribution related to the sale of an underlying business. Since the formation of the venture in 2008 we have received, including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest, over $1 billion of gross distributions. The joint venture has fairly limited assets remaining given the success to date. 
Total debt at year-end was up about $500 million since the beginning of the year to $4.3 billion, but is still only 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. 
We repurchased 4.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $422 million. For the year, we repurchased over 17 million shares at an average cost of less than $85 per share, returning nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. We announced a new $15 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year-end at 17.4 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,321213931,925004,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter. Full year sales were short of expectation",747,"Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter. Full year sales were short of expectations primarily due to a reduction in the number of larger in-year new client sales closed compared to the last several years which we expect to reverse in '16. Pipeline trends are strong, including a more typical number of larger transactions which should bode well for a faster start this year. 
Integrated sales were outstanding at nearly $90 million in the quarter and $257 million for the full year. Standouts included card services, bill payment, Mobiliti and custom statements. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $64 million in 2015, well above our goal of $50 million. Savings this year were driven primarily by strong results in procurement and workforce optimization. After the successful completion of our Atlanta facility consolidation in 2015, we will further progress are real estate and data center initiatives this year. You will also recall from our Investor Day that 2016 kicks off our new 5-year $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2016 is $40 million.
One of the bigger stories in the environment last year was increasing FI M&A activity which we expect will continue. We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade is good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape. There is no question that digital, and specifically mobile, is having a dramatic impact on the banking experience. Branches [ph] are in decline and the payment world is more dynamic than ever, which we believe will lead to meaningful opportunity.
Financial institutions are increasingly looking at technology providers to help them navigate these changing times. We believe the trends in the market align well with our innovation-based agenda and should drive further growth over the next several years. With that, let's move to 2016. 
Our 3 key enterprise priorities, which remained generally unchanged are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enable differentiated value for our clients. 
For 2016, we expect internal revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 6%. Our road map for revenue acceleration includes continued growth in our our scaled, high-quality revenue businesses, incremental contributions from our innovation-based solutions and less negative impact from both currency and the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization. As high-quality revenue comes on slowly, we again expect a higher growth rate in the second half of the year and that will likely build sequentially. We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 12% to 15% or $4.32 to $4.44 for the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be greater than $4.70 for the year.
Lastly, for guidance purposes, we do not expect the ACI asset acquisition to have a material impact on our operating results this year. 
On balance, we performed well in 2015 and showcased the power of our business model. Although we fell a bit short on reported revenue, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, drove exceptional operating margin and delivered another year of strong free cash flow. We also added meaningful new innovation to our solution portfolio and are well-positioned for the foreseeable future. Our results are a product of the commitment and dedication of our 21,000 associates around the world who strive to be their best. I'm grateful to be part of a company that delivers today while creating an even brighter tomorrow.
Lastly, as we shared with you in Q3, we expect this to be Tom's final earnings call as our CFO. And we thank him for the many contributions he has made to support the success of our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. On the selection front, we have been very pleased with the significant interest in this important role and are on track to have a successor named and in place this quarter.
With that, Laura, let's open the line for questions."

Fundamentally what we're seeing happen with the clients is that they were kind of working on their own internal schedules to get EMV cards ready and out the door. And we just sort of had a bit of a delay in how many of those were finally issued to their consumers. And some of that is a systems readiness issue and some of that was kind of just the timing with which they wanted to go through the reissue process. But because of the concerns that have been out there in the industry about the availability of chips, we saw a lot of people pushing for the manufacturing to get done and put that into their inventory in anticipation of needing to get the reissues done. So I think it's a combination of both a lot of internal process differences by clients but very importantly, concern over not coming up short on the EMV chip availability."

So you saw the FI landscape kind of ignore the issue, and then all of a sudden it became very urgent. And then they bought them and then they bought them and then they think about what's the best way to get them distributed. The other thing to keep in mind is, the cards don't have the same level of value if the merchants aren't live on their end. And so we are just really seeing -- and you're probably -- we're all seeing every once in a while now, finally a merchant says, all right, we have the put your card in the machine. So that landscape is coming together and the end-to-end equation is being built, we expect that will continue to build and that will match up well with the institutions deciding to send the cards out to their consumers and get them finally personalized."

The momentum-based growth, which is really the mass of the company in our kind of our existing business portfolio. And then we had 6 solutions that we highlighted, as representative of various innovation-based growth, we actually talked about 12 but we highlighted 6. And so from each of those 6 areas, Agiliti, DNA, EMV, Now, integrated payments for IPS and Mobiliti, we see each other those areas contributing some level of incremental growth in '16. It won't surprise you to know we're not going to talk about it specifically, but on an order of magnitude basis, we did lay out at Investor Day how we saw the ramp coming year-over-year. And so we expect some incremental benefit in '16, even more in '17, even more in '18. So we have a high degree of confidence and visibility that that's going to happen, so that's point one. Point two is we expect in a little less drag from FX. We expect to not be surprised by this lag between EMV card manufacturing and EMV card personalization so we think that will turn as well.

There's a couple of larger mid-tears that are in the process of doing conversions right now. And so there is focus out there. We see some of them are progressive institutions in the billion to 10 billion space taking a look at that, but we haven't seen beyond DNA. We've not seen a lot of movement in the market. And frankly, as I sit here today and I think about the larger transactions that have been done over the last 3 or 4 years, I can't think of a -- I honestly cannot think of a real-time solution that we did not win that went to anyone else. And so I only raised that because the other solutions that are being shows it are not real-time. So that means -- that may mean that the real time it's still early or it means that our solution in a real-time basis is one of the better solutions in the market. It's probably a little bit of both. So I think it's still very early in that genesis. Remember that on the credit union side of the community base, institutions base, they're all real-time and the old thrifts are real-time.

So you'll remember when we laid this out at our Investor Day in June, we laid out kind of a year-by-year view and that there would be 2 sources of revenue that we thought we would benefit from. We thought we would benefit from the EMV card issuance itself which is both the manufacturing and the personalization, and we believed that we would also benefit as cards got into force and we were processing those debit or credit transactions, that we would have a small list on our processing revenue. And that over time, that piece especially would build. We also anticipated that EMV would primarily happen between '15 and '17. And we're not coming off that view at this stage. I want to -- sorry, and then when we get to full boat, because these cards expire like every other cards expire, that we will get into a very natural reissue cycle as we've always been in. And so while there may be a slight hump in a quarter or in quarters, that we don't see that to be having a meaningful -- let's strike that, a material impact on our comps moving forward. Now if every single institution decides to issue in the middle of Q3 in '17 -- '16, that could create a problem, we don't see that happening. I think it's highly unlikely and I don't think anyone can actually make that happen from a manufacturing and personalization perspective. That's a long-winded way of saying we can't predict the future. I can't tell you what's going to have on quarterly comps for sure. But on a year-by-year basis, I feel like once we get into '17, that we're going to -- definitely see that's smoothing that we laid out at Investor Day. And I think if you go back take a look at that, I think that's probably the way that lays out."

As we look out I think longer, and Jeff just really hit on the EMV side of this, but if you look at different things like IPS or you look at things like Agiliti or you look at things like the Now network, those are factored in over those longer periods cycles which is '16, '17, '18, '19 because we're really trying to build this base to 50 to 100 basis points on average each year.

We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial metrics for the year.

We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial metrics for the year. These strong results were in spite of Q4 revenue that was a bit light versus expectations, driven primarily by delays in EMV card personalization and lower-than-planned license revenue.
Overall, performance in the second half of '15 was solid, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. These growth results, combined with record fourth quarter sales, should set the stage to expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016. The organization achieved an unprecedented 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. In the process, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grew adjusted operating income by 8% and broke $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time.
We anticipate strong results again in 2016. We provided internal revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, consistent with our strategic objective of stepping up our growth rate an average of 50 to 100 basis points per year. We also expect another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a record level of free cash flow per share.
As you saw on January 20, we announced the acquisition of certain digital banking and payment assets of the Community Financial Services business from ACI Worldwide. These complementary solutions are strategically aligned with our goal of enabling clients to transform their financial services experience. In addition to technology solutions, we will also welcome a group of high-quality clients and committed associates. We expect this transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, to close towards the end of the first quarter. We estimate the purchase price, including the tax benefits and run rate synergies, to be right around 5x EBITDA. We will supply additional financial information after the transaction closes.
At the beginning of the year, we established 3 key priorities to help you assess our performance, which were: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Reported internal revenue growth of 4% for the year was short of our guidance as we could not overcome the revenue delay, resulting from the unanticipated impact of the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization we mentioned in Q3. But for that negative impact, internal revenue growth for the full year would have been 5%. We saw a good growth across many of our recurring revenue businesses, such as card services, biller solutions, digital channels and account processing. Importantly, we continue to build our capabilities to steadily accelerate our internal revenue growth rate into the future. These areas of high-quality revenue growth, combined with our focus on operational efficiency, drove strong adjusted operating income growth of 8% and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Full year adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, which was $0.04 above the top end of our original guidance, and we achieved a record $4.23 in free cash flow per share. We again demonstrated the strength of our business model and like our trajectory going into 2016.
Our second priority was to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. January marked the 3-year anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition. By any measure, this transaction has been successful, adding a modern, innovative account processing technology solution, talented associates and a passionate client base. To date, we have signed 75 DNA clients and delivered substantial value to the existing client base through high-quality add-on solutions. For the year, 28 new DNA clients went live, including 9 financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, and of the 9, 6 went live in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that these recent implementations, along with the planned 2016 activity, will progressively increase revenue throughout this year.
We added a number of privileged client relationships across multiple account processing platforms in the quarter. For example, United Nations Federal Credit Union, the 28th largest credit union in the U.S. with approximately $4.3 billion in assets, selected DNA, along with a suite of integrated solutions to serve its more than 115,000 members located in 200 nations and territories around the world. Suffolk County National Bank with assets nearing $2 billion selected the premier account processing platform, along with a full suite of payment and channel solutions, including retail and business online, Mobiliti, bill payment, Popmoney and Source Capture. By selecting Fiserv as a single provider of these services, these clients expect to amplify their technology streamline operations and enhance their clients' experience.
In addition to new clients, we remained focused on deepening existing relationships with an emphasis on our payments and channel solutions. Our integrated debit and credit value propositions continue to resonate well. And in fact, we added nearly 50 new debit clients in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, we contracted to add more than 700 payment solutions across card services, bill payment and Popmoney. In addition, we've signed more than 260 institutions for our new CardValet solution, which provides value with the intersection of mobile experience in card payments. We added 43%, more than 1.2 million subscribers, to end the year with over 4 million users on Mobiliti ASP. We have several important Mobiliti releases queued up this year, which should enhance functionality and extend user engagement. We also continue to gain momentum with Mobiliti Business. This solution, in its inaugural year, added 60 clients in the quarter, and we now have more than 100 businesses live with thousands of underlying users.
Our third priority in 2015 was to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. At our Investor Conference in June, we highlighted 6 of our innovation-based solutions: Agiliti, Mobiliti, DNA, EMV, NOW and IPS, that, together, form an important part of our internal revenue growth acceleration story. We exited the year with our thesis in cap and continue to expect sequential growth rate increases in the 2016 to 2019 period.
During the year, we expanded the breadth of our Popmoney network through business disbursements and charitable giving. During the quarter, we signed a payment agreement with CARE, one of the leading humanitarian organizations in the world to accept donations using Popmoney. Through this relationship, millions of consumers will now have the option to use Popmoney to make the world a better place one payment at a time.
One of our newest in market innovations immediate funds gained important traction in the quarter. This solution enables financial institutions the option of providing consumers real-time access to deposited funds across the channel of their choice. Even after signing our first top 10 bank to immediate funds in the quarter, the pipeline remains strong for this real-time, right-now solution.
Client focus on EMV remains heightened, and activity levels are increasing. Card manufacturing accelerated again this quarter, and backlog is building. We have a much better line of sight into EMV manufacturing and personalization activity going into 2016. Accordingly, we expect strong EMV growth with volume nearing our expected peaks in the middle quarters of the year.
We signed our second client to Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution in the fourth quarter. Camden Bank, a de novo institution, selected Agiliti paired with our Mobiliti solution to bring its unique digital banking experience to the market later this year. In January, Cornerstone Mutual Services signed with Agiliti as the banking platform for the U.K. Credit Union Expansion Project with plans to initially migrate up to 40 U.K. credit unions in 2016. Our Agiliti pipeline remains strong as we head into the year.
Finally, we closed a very small biller solutions acquisition in January, buying Hewlett-Packard Enterprises Convenience Pay Services business. This expands our biller footprint to a modern SaaS platform, enabling electronic payment acceptance for a broad range of billers. We anticipate the business will generate roughly 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, and that the synergy adjusted net purchase price multiple will be around 3x EBITDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis point",1180,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact from FX and the unanticipated EMV card personalization delays. Our full year internal revenue growth rate would have been 5% excluding the unanticipated impact of these items.
Our revenue for the year is a tale of 2 cities as our processing and services recurring revenue increased 5% even after the negative currency impact. On the other hand, product revenue was short of plan for the year and declined compared to 2014 due primarily to lower-than-anticipated base and EMV revenue in our Output Solutions business and lowered-than-planned license revenue for the year. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue, which is key to our long-term growth profile.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 12% over the prior year to $1. Full year adjusted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our original guidance range, growing 15% to $3.87.
Full year adjusted operating margin performance was up a very strong 120 basis points to 31.7%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, expense discipline and a continued focus on Operational Effectiveness. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 30.7% with comparisons negatively impacted by the timing of our fall client conference, revenue mix and higher expenses in our corporate segment, which, by itself, negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points in the quarter.
At the segment level, our Payments businesses delivered 6% internal revenue growth in the quarter and 5% for the full year. Growth was primarily led by our card services, biller and channels businesses. Our Output Solutions business saw a base business momentum in the fourth quarter, and EMV demand was strong as we had anticipated. A longer lag between manufacturing and personalization of EMV cards led to an additional $7 million revenue deferral in the quarter on top of the $9 million in the third quarter. Our clients purchased a large amount of manufactured EMV card product in 2015, which has not yet been rolled out to their customers. Given visibility and demand, we anticipate that EMV revenue will accelerate substantially into 2016 as our clients move forward with the final card personalization and distribute the EMV cards to consumers.
We again leveraged the power of our integrated card value proposition and finished the year with a very strong sales quarter, signing 49 new debit clients and a total of nearly 150 for the year. Debit transactions continued to grow above market with high single-digit growth for the year.
Our industry-leading bill payment and person-to-person payment solutions continue to grow. For the year, bill payment transactions grew in the low single digits and Popmoney transactions were up over 20%. In Q4, we delivered the first relief supporting our integrated payment strategy, or IPS, which warrants a new integrated bill payment, P2P and transfer experience. The early returns are encouraging as we expect further growth from these payment transactions in 2016 and over the next several years.
As Jeff mentioned, Mobiliti ASP users were up sharply year-over-year, gaining over 40% and crossing the 4 million subscriber threshold. We continue to believe digital transformation is forging a long runway for revenue growth in both digital subscribers and transactional services.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter to $224 million and, for the year, was up 9% to $840 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 33.6% and was up 130 basis points to 33% for the year. This strong performance is driven by high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency even as we continue to invest in targeted elevation.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $631 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. This solid performance, which includes a negative currency impact of 60 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the year, was led by our account processing and lending businesses.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million in the quarter and $826 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was pressured by the timing of expenses, including our fall client conference and business mix in the quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin was excellent, up 120 basis points, driven by growth in our scale businesses such as account processing and the benefit of our Operational Effectiveness initiatives.
Corporate segment net adjusted operating performance in the quarter was in line sequentially but up over the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and an increase in certain consulting expenses. This year-over-year increase in expense reduced overall company operating margin in the quarter by 50 basis points.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 34.6% in both the quarter and year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than expected due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit, offset by the timing of other discrete tax items. Our effective adjusted tax rate was up 60 basis points for the full year due to lower discrete tax benefits in 2015 than the prior year, which equates to about a 1% or $0.04 per share negative impact on this year's adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 35% in 2016.
We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Free cash flow per share increased 11% to $4.23, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $3.87. We believe that combined benefits of focusing on high-quality revenue, along with disciplined capital allocation, will continue to reduce excellent free cash flow per share results.
We received $36 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2015, which are substantially excluded from our free cash flow results. In January, we received an additional $140 million distribution related to the sale of an underlying business. Since the formation of the venture in 2008, we have received, including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest, over $1 billion of gross distributions. The joint venture has fairly limited assets remaining given the success to date.
Total debt at year end was up about $500 million since the beginning of the year to $4.3 billion but is still only 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio.
We repurchased 4.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $422 million. For the year, we repurchased over 17 million shares at an average cost of less than $85 per share, returning nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. We announced a new 15 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year end, at 17.4 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,321213931,925045,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter.Full year sales were short of expect",747,"Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter.
Full year sales were short of expectations primarily due to a reduction in the number of larger in-year new client sales closed compared to the last several years, which we expect to reverse in '16. Pipeline trends are strong, including a more typical number of larger transactions, which should bode well for a faster start this year.
Integrated sales were outstanding at nearly $90 million in the quarter and $257 million for the full year. Standouts included card services, bill payment, Mobiliti and custom statements. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $64 million in 2015, well above our goal of $50 million. Savings this year were driven primarily by strong results in procurement and workforce optimization.
After the successful completion of our Atlanta facility consolidation in 2015, we will further progress our real estate and data center initiatives this year. You will also recall from our Investor Day that 2016 kicks off our new 5-year $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2016 is $40 million.
One of the bigger stories in the environment last year was increasing FI M&A activity, which we expect will continue. We view the fed rate increase for the first time in a decade is good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape. There is no question that digital and, specifically, mobile, is having a dramatic impact on the banking experience. Branches are in decline and the payment world is more dynamic than ever, which we believe will lead to meaningful opportunity.
Financial institutions are increasingly looking at technology providers to help them navigate these changing times. We believe the trends in the market align well with our innovation-based agenda and should drive further growth over the next several years.
With that, let's move to 2016. Our 3 key enterprise priorities, which remained generally unchanged, are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.
For 2016, we expect internal revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 6%. Our road map for revenue acceleration includes continued growth in our scaled, high-quality revenue businesses, incremental contributions from our innovation-based solutions and less negative impact from both currency and the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization. As high-quality revenue comes on slowly, we again expect a higher growth rate in the second half of the year, and that will likely build sequentially.
We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 12% to 15% or $4.32 to $4.44 for the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, and that free cash flow per share will be greater than $4.70 for the year.
Lastly, for guidance purposes, we do not expect the ACI asset acquisition to have a material impact on our operating results this year.
On balance, we performed well in 2015 and showcased the power of our business model. Although we fell a bit short on reported revenue, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, drove exceptional operating margin and delivered another year of strong free cash flow. We also added meaningful new innovation to our solution portfolio and are well positioned for the foreseeable future.
Our results are a product of the commitment and dedication of our 21,000 associates around the world who strive to be their best. I'm grateful to be part of a company that delivers today while creating an even brighter tomorrow.
Lastly, as we shared with you in Q3, we expect this to be Tom's final earnings call as our CFO. And we thank him for the many contributions he has made to support the success of our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. On the selection front, we have been very pleased with the significant interest in this important role and are on track to have a successor named and in place this quarter.

And most of those impacts, we're doing a lot of the consolidation activities around our data center optimization efforts in '16, which is not going to have the full run rate benefit until largely '17 and '18, and so that's probably the biggest driver in that case because it's a little bit different than the benefits we had in '15, which were focused a lot on procurement.

Fundamentally, what we're seeing happen with the clients is that they were kind of working on their own internal schedules to get EMV cards ready and out the door. And we just sort of had a bit of a delay in how many of those were finally issued to their consumers. And some of that is a systems readiness issue and some of that was kind of just the timing with which they wanted to go through the reissue process. But because of the concerns that have been out there in the industry about the availability of chips, we saw a lot of people pushing for the manufacturing to get done and put that into their inventory in anticipation of needing to get the reissues done. So I think it's a combination of both a lot of internal process differences by clients but, very importantly, concern over not coming up short on the EMV chip availability."

So you saw the FI landscape kind of ignore the issue, and then, all of a sudden, it became very urgent. And then they bought them, and then they had to think about what's the best way to get them distributed. The other thing to keep in mind is the cards don't have the same level of value if the merchants aren't live on their end. And so we are just really seeing -- and you're probably -- we're all seeing it every once in a while now, finally, a merchant says, ""All right, well, you have to put your card into the machine.""

We actually talked about 12, but we highlighted 6. And so from each of those 6 areas: Agiliti; DNA; EMV; NOW; integrated payments, or IPS; and Mobiliti, we see each of those areas contributing some level of incremental growth in '16. It won't surprise you to know we're not going to talk about it specifically, but on an order of magnitude basis, we did lay out at Investor Day how we saw the ramp coming year-over-year. And so we expect some incremental benefit in '16, even more in '17, even more in '18. So we have a high degree of confidence and visibility that, that's going to happen. So that's point one.

There's a couple of larger mid-tiers that are in the process of doing conversions right now. And so there is focus out there. We see some of the more progressive institutions in the $1 billion to $10 billion space taking a look at that, but we haven't seen beyond DNA. We've not seen a lot of movement in the market. And frankly, as I sit here today and I think about the larger transactions that have been done over the last 3 or 4 years, I can't think of a -- I honestly cannot think of a real-time solution that we did not win that went to anyone else. And so I only raised that because the other solutions that are being chosen are not real-time. So that means -- that may mean that the real-time it's still early, or it may mean that our solution on a real-time basis is one of the better solutions in the market. It's probably a little bit of both. So I think it's still very early in that genesis. Remember that on the credit union side of the community base, institutions base, they're all real-time and the old thrifts are real-time.

So you'll remember when we laid this out at our Investor Day in June, we laid out kind of a year-by-year view and that there would be 2 sources of revenue that we thought we would benefit from. We thought we would benefit from the EMV card issuance itself, which is both the manufacturing and the personalization, and we believed that we would also benefit as cards got into force and we were processing those debit or credit transactions, that we would have a small lift on our processing revenue. And that, over time, that piece especially would build. We also anticipated that EMV would primarily happen between '15 and '17. And we're not coming off that view at this stage. I want to -- sorry, and then when we get to full bow, because these cards expire like every other cards expire, that we will get into a very natural reissue cycle as we've always been in. And so while there may be a slight hump in a quarter or in quarters, that we don't see that to be having a meaningful -- strike that, a material impact on our comps moving forward. Now if every single institution decides to issue in the middle of Q3 in '17 -- '16, that could create a problem. We don't see that happening. I think it's highly unlikely and I don't think anyone could actually make that happen from a manufacturing and personalization perspective. That's a long-winded way of saying we can't predict the future. I can't tell you what's going to happen on quarterly comps for sure. But on a year-by-year basis, I feel like once we get into '17 that we're going to see -- definitely see that smoothing that we laid out at Investor Day.

We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial metrics for the year.

We capped off 2015 with fourth quarter performance that allowed us to exceed the majority of our financial metrics for the year. These strong results were in spite of Q4 revenue that was a bit light versus expectations, driven primarily by delays in EMV card personalization and lower-than-planned license revenue.
Overall, performance in the second half of '15 was solid, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters. These growth results, combined with record fourth quarter sales, should set the stage to expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016. The organization achieved an unprecedented 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. In the process, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grew adjusted operating income by 8% and broke $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time.
We anticipate strong results again in 2016. We provided internal revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, consistent with our strategic objective of stepping up our growth rate an average of 50 to 100 basis points per year. We also expect another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a record level of free cash flow per share.
As you saw on January 20, we announced the acquisition of certain digital banking and payment assets of the Community Financial Services business from ACI Worldwide. These complementary solutions are strategically aligned with our goal of enabling clients to transform their financial services experience. In addition to technology solutions, we will also welcome a group of high-quality clients and committed associates. We expect this transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, to close towards the end of the first quarter. We estimate the purchase price, including the tax benefits and run rate synergies, to be right around 5x EBITDA. We will supply additional financial information after the transaction closes.
At the beginning of the year, we established 3 key priorities to help you assess our performance, which were: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Reported internal revenue growth of 4% for the year was short of our guidance as we could not overcome the revenue delay, resulting from the unanticipated impact of the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization we mentioned in Q3. But for that negative impact, internal revenue growth for the full year would have been 5%. We saw a good growth across many of our recurring revenue businesses, such as card services, biller solutions, digital channels and account processing. Importantly, we continue to build our capabilities to steadily accelerate our internal revenue growth rate into the future. These areas of high-quality revenue growth, combined with our focus on operational efficiency, drove strong adjusted operating income growth of 8% and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Full year adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, which was $0.04 above the top end of our original guidance, and we achieved a record $4.23 in free cash flow per share. We again demonstrated the strength of our business model and like our trajectory going into 2016.
Our second priority was to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. January marked the 3-year anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition. By any measure, this transaction has been successful, adding a modern, innovative account processing technology solution, talented associates and a passionate client base. To date, we have signed 75 DNA clients and delivered substantial value to the existing client base through high-quality add-on solutions. For the year, 28 new DNA clients went live, including 9 financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, and of the 9, 6 went live in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that these recent implementations, along with the planned 2016 activity, will progressively increase revenue throughout this year.
We added a number of privileged client relationships across multiple account processing platforms in the quarter. For example, United Nations Federal Credit Union, the 28th largest credit union in the U.S. with approximately $4.3 billion in assets, selected DNA, along with a suite of integrated solutions to serve its more than 115,000 members located in 200 nations and territories around the world. Suffolk County National Bank with assets nearing $2 billion selected the premier account processing platform, along with a full suite of payment and channel solutions, including retail and business online, Mobiliti, bill payment, Popmoney and Source Capture. By selecting Fiserv as a single provider of these services, these clients expect to amplify their technology, streamline operations and enhance their clients' experience.
In addition to new clients, we remained focused on deepening existing relationships with an emphasis on our payments and channel solutions. Our integrated debit and credit value propositions continue to resonate well. And in fact, we added nearly 50 new debit clients in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, we contracted to add more than 700 payment solutions across card services, bill payment and Popmoney. In addition, we've signed more than 260 institutions for our new CardValet solution, which provides value at the intersection of mobile experience and card payments. We added 43%, more than 1.2 million subscribers, to end the year with over 4 million users on Mobiliti ASP. We have several important Mobiliti releases queued up this year, which should enhance functionality and extend user engagement. We also continue to gain momentum with Mobiliti Business. This solution, in its inaugural year, added 60 clients in the quarter, and we now have more than 100 businesses live with thousands of underlying users.
Our third priority in 2015 was to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. At our Investor Conference in June, we highlighted 6 of our innovation-based solutions: Agiliti, Mobiliti, DNA, EMV, NOW and IPS, that, together, form an important part of our internal revenue growth acceleration story. We exited the year with our thesis intact, and continue to expect sequential growth rate increases in the 2016 to 2019 period.
During the year, we expanded the breadth of our Popmoney network for business disbursements and charitable giving. During the quarter, we signed a payment agreement with CARE, one of the leading humanitarian organizations in the world, to accept donations using Popmoney. Through this relationship, millions of consumers will now have the option to use Popmoney to make the world a better place one payment at a time.
One of our newest in market innovations, Immediate Funds, gained important traction in the quarter. This solution enables financial institutions the option of providing consumers real-time access to deposited funds across the channel of their choice. Even after signing our first top 10 bank to Immediate Funds in the quarter, the pipeline remains strong for this real-time, right-now solution.
Client focus on EMV remains heightened, and activity levels are increasing. Card manufacturing accelerated again this quarter, and backlog is building. We have a much better line of sight into EMV manufacturing and personalization activity going into 2016. Accordingly, we expect strong EMV growth with volume nearing our expected peaks in the middle quarters of the year.
We signed our second client to Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, in the fourth quarter. Camden Bank, a de novo institution, selected Agiliti paired with our Mobiliti solution to bring its unique digital banking experience to the market later this year. In January, Cornerstone Mutual Services signed with Agiliti as the banking platform for the U.K. Credit Union Expansion Project with plans to initially migrate up to 40 U.K. credit unions in 2016. Our Agiliti pipeline remains strong as we head into the year.
Finally, we closed a very small biller solutions acquisition in January, buying Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' Convenience Pay Services business. This expands our biller footprint to a modern SaaS platform, enabling electronic payment acceptance for a broad range of billers. We anticipate the business will generate roughly 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, and that the synergy adjusted net purchase price multiple will be around 3x EBITDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact from FX and the unanticipated EMV card personalization delays. Our full year internal revenue growth rate would have been 5% excluding the unanticipated impact of these items.
Our revenue for the year is a tale of 2 cities as our processing and services recurring revenue increased 5% even after the negative currency impact. On the other hand, product revenue was short of plan for the year and declined compared to 2014 due primarily to lower-than-anticipated base and EMV revenue in our Output Solutions business and lowered-than-planned license revenue for the year. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue, which is key to our long-term growth profile.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 12% over the prior year to $1. Full year adjusted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our original guidance range, growing 15% to $3.87.
Full year adjusted operating margin performance was up a very strong 120 basis points to 31.7%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, expense discipline and a continued focus on Operational Effectiveness. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 30.7% with comparisons negatively impacted by the timing of our fall client conference, revenue mix and higher expenses in our corporate segment, which, by itself, negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points in the quarter.
At the segment level, our Payments businesses delivered 6% internal revenue growth in the quarter and 5% for the full year. Growth was primarily led by our card services, biller and channels businesses. Our Output Solutions business saw a base business momentum in the fourth quarter, and EMV demand was strong as we had anticipated. A longer lag between manufacturing and personalization of EMV cards led to an additional $7 million revenue deferral in the quarter on top of the $9 million in the third quarter. Our clients purchased a large amount of manufactured EMV card product in 2015, which has not yet been rolled out to their customers. Given visibility and demand, we anticipate that EMV revenue will accelerate substantially into 2016 as our clients move forward with the final card personalization and distribute the EMV cards to consumers.
We again leveraged the power of our integrated card value proposition and finished the year with a very strong sales quarter, signing 49 new debit clients and a total of nearly 150 for the year. Debit transactions continued to grow above market with high single-digit growth for the year.
Our industry-leading bill payment and person-to-person payment solutions continue to grow. For the year, bill payment transactions grew in the low single digits and Popmoney transactions were up over 20%. In Q4, we delivered the first release supporting our integrated payment strategy, or IPS, which warrants a new integrated bill payment, P2P and transfer experience. The early returns are encouraging, as we expect further growth from these payment transactions in 2016 and over the next several years.
As Jeff mentioned, Mobiliti ASP users were up sharply year-over-year, gaining over 40% and crossing the 4 million subscriber threshold. We continue to believe digital transformation is forging a long runway for revenue growth in both digital subscribers and transactional services.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter to $224 million and, for the year, was up 9% to $840 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 33.6% and was up 130 basis points to 33% for the year. This strong performance is driven by high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency even as we continue to invest in targeted innovation.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $631 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. This solid performance, which includes a negative currency impact of 60 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the year, was led by our account processing and lending businesses.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million in the quarter and $826 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was pressured by the timing of expenses, including our fall client conference and business mix in the quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin was excellent, up 120 basis points, driven by growth in our scale businesses such as account processing and the benefit of our Operational Effectiveness initiatives.
Corporate segment net adjusted operating performance in the quarter was in line sequentially but up over the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and an increase in certain consulting expenses. This year-over-year increase in expense reduced overall company operating margin in the quarter by 50 basis points.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 34.6% in both the quarter and year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than expected due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit, offset by the timing of other discrete tax items. Our effective adjusted tax rate was up 60 basis points for the full year due to lower discrete tax benefits in 2015 than the prior year, which equates to about a 1% or $0.04 per share negative impact on this year's adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 35% in 2016.
We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Free cash flow per share increased 11% to $4.23, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $3.87. We believe the combined benefits of focusing on high-quality revenue, along with disciplined capital allocation, will continue to produce excellent free cash flow per share results.
We received $36 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2015, which are substantially excluded from our free cash flow results. In January, we received an additional $140 million distribution related to the sale of an underlying business. Since the formation of the venture in 2008, we have received, including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest, over $1 billion of gross distributions. The joint venture has fairly limited assets remaining given the success to date.
Total debt at year end was up about $500 million since the beginning of the year to $4.3 billion but is still only 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio.
We repurchased 4.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $422 million. For the year, we repurchased over 17 million shares at an average cost of less than $85 per share, returning nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. We announced a new 15 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year end had 17.4 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."

Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter.Full year sales were short of expect",747,"Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter.
Full year sales were short of expectations primarily due to a reduction in the number of larger in-year new client sales closed compared to the last several years, which we expect to reverse in '16. Pipeline trends are strong, including a more typical number of larger transactions, which should bode well for a faster start this year.
Integrated sales were outstanding at nearly $90 million in the quarter and $257 million for the full year. Standouts included card services, bill payment, Mobiliti and custom statements. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $64 million in 2015, well above our goal of $50 million. Savings this year were driven primarily by strong results in procurement and workforce optimization.
After the successful completion of our Atlanta facility consolidation in 2015, we will further progress our real estate and data center initiatives this year. You will also recall from our Investor Day that 2016 kicks off our new 5-year $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2016 is $40 million.
One of the bigger stories in the environment last year was increasing FI M&A activity, which we expect will continue. We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape. There is no question that digital and, specifically, mobile, is having a dramatic impact on the banking experience. Branches are in decline and the payment world is more dynamic than ever, which we believe will lead to meaningful opportunity.
Financial institutions are increasingly looking at technology providers to help them navigate these changing times. We believe the trends in the market align well with our innovation-based agenda and should drive further growth over the next several years.
With that, let's move to 2016. Our 3 key enterprise priorities, which remained generally unchanged, are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.
For 2016, we expect internal revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 6%. Our road map for revenue acceleration includes continued growth in our scaled, high-quality revenue businesses, incremental contributions from our innovation-based solutions and less negative impact from both currency and the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization. As high-quality revenue comes on slowly, we again expect a higher growth rate in the second half of the year, and that will likely build sequentially.
We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 12% to 15% or $4.32 to $4.44 for the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, and that free cash flow per share will be greater than $4.70 for the year.
Lastly, for guidance purposes, we do not expect the ACI asset acquisition to have a material impact on our operating results this year.
On balance, we performed well in 2015 and showcased the power of our business model. Although we fell a bit short on reported revenue, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, drove exceptional operating margin and delivered another year of strong free cash flow. We also added meaningful new innovation to our solution portfolio and are well positioned for the foreseeable future.
Our results are a product of the commitment and dedication of our 21,000 associates around the world who strive to be their best. I'm grateful to be part of a company that delivers today while creating an even brighter tomorrow.
Lastly, as we shared with you in Q3, we expect this to be Tom's final earnings call as our CFO. And we thank him for the many contributions he has made to support the success of our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. On the selection front, we have been very pleased with the significant interest in this important role and are on track to have a successor named and in place this quarter.
With that, Laura, let's open the line for questions."

And most of those impacts, we're doing a lot of the consolidation activities around our data center optimization efforts in '16, which is not going to have the full run rate benefit until largely '17 and '18, and so that's probably the biggest driver in that case because it's a little bit different than the benefits we had in '15, which were focused a lot on procurement.

And we just sort of had a bit of a delay in how many of those were finally issued to their consumers. And some of that is a systems readiness issue and some of that was kind of just the timing with which they wanted to go through with the reissue process. But because of the concerns that have been out there in the industry about the availability of chips, we saw a lot of people pushing for the manufacturing to get done and put that into their inventory in anticipation of needing to get the reissues done. So I think it's a combination of both a lot of internal process differences by clients but, very importantly, concern over not coming up short on the EMV chip availability."

And then they bought them, and then they had to think about what's the best way to get them distributed. The other thing to keep in mind is the cards don't have the same level of value if the merchants aren't live on their end. And so we are just really seeing -- and you're probably -- we're all seeing it every once in a while now, finally, a merchant says, ""All right, well, you have to put your card into the machine."" So that landscape is coming together, and the end-to-end equation is being built.

So Glenn, let me take it, and then Tom and Mark can add in as needed. So when I think about the drivers of the growth acceleration in '16, you have -- as we laid out at Investor Day, we laid out that we were thinking about our growth in 2 separate baskets: the momentum-based growth, which is really the mass of the company in our kind of existing business portfolio; and then we had 6 solutions that we highlighted as representative of areas of innovation-based growth. We actually talked about 12, but we highlighted 6. And so from each of those 6 areas: Agiliti; DNA; EMV; NOW; Integrated Payments, or IPS; and Mobiliti, we see each of those areas contributing some level of incremental growth in '16. It won't surprise you to know we're not going to talk about it specifically, but on an order of magnitude basis, we did lay out at Investor Day how we saw the ramp coming year-over-year. And so we expect some incremental benefit in '16, even more in '17, even more in '18. So we have a high degree of confidence and visibility that, that's going to happen. So that's point one. Point two is we expect to have a little less drag from FX. We expect to not be surprised by this lag between EMV card manufacturing and EMV card personalization. So we think that will turn as well. So when you add all those up, it gives us a pretty good degree of confidence and frankly a good degree of visibility into how we get from 2015 into 2016, which we believe will act as a step to 2017."

So there's a lot of talk around real-time core systems and there is a lot of looking going on -- or there's not a lot -- not a lot relative numbers, but a lot on a relative basis to what we've seen historically for larger institutions looking at what would it take to convert real-time. There's a couple of larger mid-tiers that are in the process of doing conversions right now. And so there is focus out there. We see some of the more progressive institutions in the $1 billion to $10 billion space taking a look at that, but we haven't seen beyond DNA. We've not seen a lot of movement in the market. And frankly, as I sit here today and I think about the larger transactions that have been done over the last 3 or 4 years, I can't think of a -- I honestly cannot think of a real-time solution that we did not win that went to anyone else. And so I only raise that because the other solutions that are being chosen are not real-time. So that means -- that may mean that the real-time is still early, or it may mean that our solution on a real-time basis is one of the better solutions in the market. It's probably a little bit of both. So I think it's still very early in that genesis. Remember that on the credit union side of the community base, institutions base, they're all real-time and the old thrifts are real-time. So you really have what -- the core banking world as the focus for real-time. And I think we'll continue to see that over the next 3 to 5 years, but we're early."

So you'll remember when we laid this out at our Investor Day in June, we laid out kind of a year-by-year view and that there would be 2 sources of revenue that we thought we would benefit from. We thought we would benefit from the EMV card issuance itself, which is both the manufacturing and the personalization, and we believed that we would also benefit as cards got into force and we were processing those debit or credit transactions, that we would have a small lift on our processing revenue. And that, over time, that piece especially would build. We also anticipated that EMV would primarily happen between '15 and '17. And we're not coming off that view at this stage. I want to -- sorry, and then when we get to full bow, because these cards expire like every other cards expire, that we will get into a very natural reissue cycle as we've always been in. And so while there may be a slight hump in a quarter or in quarters, that we don't see that to be having a meaningful -- strike that, a material impact on our comps moving forward. Now if every single institution decides to issue in the middle of Q3 in '17 -- '16, that could create a problem. We don't see that happening. I think it's highly unlikely and I don't think anyone could actually make that happen from a manufacturing and personalization perspective. That's a long-winded way of saying we can't predict the future. I can't tell you what's going to happen on quarterly comps for sure. But on a year-by-year basis, I feel like once we get into '17 that we're going to see -- definitely see that smoothing that we laid out at Investor Day. And if you go back and take a look at that, I think that's probably the way that lays out."

As we look out I think longer, and Jeff just really hit on the EMV side of this, but if you look at different things like IPS, or you look at things like Agiliti, or you look at things like the NOW Network, those are factored in over those longer period cycles, which is '16, '17, '18, '19, because we're really trying to build this base of 50 to 100 basis points on average each year.

These growth results, combined with record fourth quarter sales, should set the stage to expand our internal revenue growth rate in 2016. The organization achieved an unprecedented 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. In the process, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grew adjusted operating income by 8% and broke $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time.
We anticipate strong results again in 2016. We provided internal revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, consistent with our strategic objective of stepping up our growth rate an average of 50 to 100 basis points per year. We also expect another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, at least 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a record level of free cash flow per share.
As you saw on January 20, we announced the acquisition of certain digital banking and payment assets of the Community Financial Services business from ACI Worldwide. These complementary solutions are strategically aligned with our goal of enabling clients to transform their financial services experience. In addition to technology solutions, we will also welcome a group of high-quality clients and committed associates. We expect this transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, to close towards the end of the first quarter. We estimate the purchase price, including the tax benefits and run rate synergies, to be right around 5x EBITDA. We will supply additional financial information after the transaction closes.
At the beginning of the year, we established 3 key priorities to help you assess our performance, which were: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Reported internal revenue growth of 4% for the year was short of our guidance as we could not overcome the revenue delay, resulting from the unanticipated impact of the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization we mentioned in Q3. But for that negative impact, internal revenue growth for the full year would have been 5%. We saw a good growth across many of our recurring revenue businesses, such as card services, biller solutions, digital channels and account processing. Importantly, we continue to build our capabilities to steadily accelerate our internal revenue growth rate into the future. These areas of high-quality revenue growth, combined with our focus on operational efficiency, drove strong adjusted operating income growth of 8% and 120 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Full year adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, which was $0.04 above the top end of our original guidance, and we achieved a record $4.23 in free cash flow per share. We again demonstrated the strength of our business model and like our trajectory going into 2016.
Our second priority was to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. January marked the 3-year anniversary of the Open Solutions acquisition. By any measure, this transaction has been successful, adding a modern, innovative account processing technology solution, talented associates and a passionate client base. To date, we have signed 75 DNA clients and delivered substantial value to the existing client base through high-quality add-on solutions. For the year, 28 new DNA clients went live, including 9 financial institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, and of the 9, 6 went live in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that these recent implementations, along with the planned 2016 activity, will progressively increase revenue throughout this year.
We added a number of privileged client relationships across multiple account processing platforms in the quarter. For example, United Nations Federal Credit Union, the 28th largest credit union in the U.S. with approximately $4.3 billion in assets, selected DNA, along with a suite of integrated solutions to serve its more than 115,000 members located in 200 nations and territories around the world. Suffolk County National Bank with assets nearing $2 billion selected the premier account processing platform, along with a full suite of payment and channel solutions, including retail and business online, Mobiliti, bill payment, Popmoney and Source Capture. By selecting Fiserv as a single provider of these services, these clients expect to amplify their technology, streamline operations and enhance their clients' experience.
In addition to new clients, we remained focused on deepening existing relationships with an emphasis on our payments and channel solutions. Our integrated debit and credit value propositions continue to resonate well. And in fact, we added nearly 50 new debit clients in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, we contracted to add more than 700 payment solutions across card services, bill payment and Popmoney. In addition, we've signed more than 260 institutions for our new CardValet solution, which provides value at the intersection of mobile experience and card payments. We added 43%, more than 1.2 million subscribers, to end the year with over 4 million users on Mobiliti ASP. We have several important Mobiliti releases queued up this year, which should enhance functionality and extend user engagement. We also continue to gain momentum with Mobiliti Business. This solution, in its inaugural year, added 60 clients in the quarter, and we now have more than 100 businesses live with thousands of underlying users.
Our third priority in 2015 was to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. At our Investor Conference in June, we highlighted 6 of our innovation-based solutions: Agiliti, Mobiliti, DNA, EMV, NOW and IPS, that, together, form an important part of our internal revenue growth acceleration story. We exited the year with our thesis intact, and continue to expect sequential growth rate increases in the 2016 to 2019 period.
During the year, we expanded the breadth of our Popmoney network for business disbursements and charitable giving. During the quarter, we signed a payment agreement with CARE, one of the leading humanitarian organizations in the world, to accept donations using Popmoney. Through this relationship, millions of consumers will now have the option to use Popmoney to make the world a better place one payment at a time.
One of our newest in market innovations, Immediate Funds, gained important traction in the quarter. This solution enables financial institutions the option of providing consumers real-time access to deposited funds across the channel of their choice. Even after signing our first top 10 bank to Immediate Funds in the quarter, the pipeline remains strong for this real-time, right-now solution.
Client focus on EMV remains heightened, and activity levels are increasing. Card manufacturing accelerated again this quarter, and backlog is building. We have a much better line of sight into EMV manufacturing and personalization activity going into 2016. Accordingly, we expect strong EMV growth with volume nearing our expected peaks in the middle quarters of the year.
We signed our second client to Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, in the fourth quarter. Camden Bank, a de novo institution, selected Agiliti paired with our Mobiliti solution to bring its unique digital banking experience to the market later this year. In January, Cornerstone Mutual Services signed with Agiliti as the banking platform for the U.K. Credit Union Expansion Project with plans to initially migrate up to 40 U.K. credit unions in 2016. Our Agiliti pipeline remains strong as we head into the year.
Finally, we closed a very small biller solutions acquisition in January, buying Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' Convenience Pay Services business. This expands our biller footprint to a modern SaaS platform, enabling electronic payment acceptance for a broad range of billers. We anticipate the business will generate roughly 1/2 of 1% of total revenue, and that the synergy adjusted net purchase price multiple will be around 3x EBITDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."
128209,321213931,925971,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis point",1180,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 5% to $1.3 billion and increased 4% to $4.9 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and up 4% for the full year, including 180 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact from FX and the unanticipated EMV card personalization delays. Our full year internal revenue growth rate would have been 5% excluding the unanticipated impact of these items.
Our revenue for the year is a tale of 2 cities as our processing and services recurring revenue increased 5% even after the negative currency impact. On the other hand, product revenue was short of plan for the year and declined compared to 2014 due primarily to lower-than-anticipated base and EMV revenue in our Output Solutions business and lowered-than-planned license revenue for the year. We continue to build high-quality recurring revenue, which is key to our long-term growth profile.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 12% over the prior year to $1. Full year adjusted earnings per share exceeded the top end of our original guidance range, growing 15% to $3.87.
Full year adjusted operating margin performance was up a very strong 120 basis points to 31.7%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, expense discipline and a continued focus on Operational Effectiveness. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter increased 10 basis points to 30.7% with comparisons negatively impacted by the timing of our fall client conference, revenue mix and higher expenses in our corporate segment, which, by itself, negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points in the quarter.
At the segment level, our Payments businesses delivered 6% internal revenue growth in the quarter and 5% for the full year. Growth was primarily led by our card services, biller and channels businesses. Our Output Solutions business saw a base business momentum in the fourth quarter, and EMV demand was strong as we had anticipated. A longer lag between manufacturing and personalization of EMV cards led to an additional $7 million revenue deferral in the quarter on top of the $9 million in the third quarter. Our clients purchased a large amount of manufactured EMV card product in 2015, which has not yet been rolled out to their customers. Given visibility and demand, we anticipate that EMV revenue will accelerate substantially into 2016 as our clients move forward with the final card personalization and distribute the EMV cards to consumers.
We again leveraged the power of our integrated card value proposition and finished the year with a very strong sales quarter, signing 49 new debit clients and a total of nearly 150 for the year. Debit transactions continued to grow above market with high single-digit growth for the year.
Our industry-leading bill payment and person-to-person payment solutions continue to grow. For the year, bill payment transactions grew in the low single digits and Popmoney transactions were up over 20%. In Q4, we delivered the first release supporting our integrated payment strategy, or IPS, which warrants a new integrated bill payment, P2P and transfer experience. The early returns are encouraging, as we expect further growth from these payment transactions in 2016 and over the next several years.
As Jeff mentioned, Mobiliti ASP users were up sharply year-over-year, gaining over 40% and crossing the 4 million subscriber threshold. We continue to believe digital transformation is forging a long runway for revenue growth in both digital subscribers and transactional services.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter to $224 million and, for the year, was up 9% to $840 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 33.6% and was up 130 basis points to 33% for the year. This strong performance is driven by high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency even as we continue to invest in targeted innovation.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $631 million in the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year. This solid performance, which includes a negative currency impact of 60 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the year, was led by our account processing and lending businesses.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million in the quarter and $826 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was pressured by the timing of expenses, including our fall client conference and business mix in the quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin was excellent, up 120 basis points, driven by growth in our scale businesses such as account processing and the benefit of our Operational Effectiveness initiatives.
Corporate segment net adjusted operating performance in the quarter was in line sequentially but up over the prior year, primarily due to the timing of expenses and an increase in certain consulting expenses. This year-over-year increase in expense reduced overall company operating margin in the quarter by 50 basis points.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 34.6% in both the quarter and year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than expected due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit, offset by the timing of other discrete tax items. Our effective adjusted tax rate was up 60 basis points for the full year due to lower discrete tax benefits in 2015 than the prior year, which equates to about a 1% or $0.04 per share negative impact on this year's adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 35% in 2016.
We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Free cash flow per share increased 11% to $4.23, 9% higher than our adjusted EPS of $3.87. We believe the combined benefits of focusing on high-quality revenue, along with disciplined capital allocation, will continue to produce excellent free cash flow per share results.
We received $36 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2015, which are substantially excluded from our free cash flow results. In January, we received an additional $140 million distribution related to the sale of an underlying business. Since the formation of the venture in 2008, we have received, including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest, over $1 billion of gross distributions. The joint venture has fairly limited assets remaining given the success to date.
Total debt at year end was up about $500 million since the beginning of the year to $4.3 billion but is still only 2.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio.
We repurchased 4.5 million shares of stock in the quarter for $422 million. For the year, we repurchased over 17 million shares at an average cost of less than $85 per share, returning nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. We announced a new 15 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year end had 17.4 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,321213931,925971,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter.Full year sales were short of expect",747,"Thanks, Tom. Strong sales in the quarter led to a 3% increase in TCV over the last year's record level. In addition to the wins mentioned earlier, we had excellent results across most of our businesses in the quarter.
Full year sales were short of expectations primarily due to a reduction in the number of larger in-year new client sales closed compared to the last several years, which we expect to reverse in '16. Pipeline trends are strong, including a more typical number of larger transactions, which should bode well for a faster start this year.
Integrated sales were outstanding at nearly $90 million in the quarter and $257 million for the full year. Standouts included card services, bill payment, Mobiliti and custom statements. We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $64 million in 2015, well above our goal of $50 million. Savings this year were driven primarily by strong results in procurement and workforce optimization.
After the successful completion of our Atlanta facility consolidation in 2015, we will further progress our real estate and data center initiatives this year. You will also recall from our Investor Day that 2016 kicks off our new 5-year $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2016 is $40 million.
One of the bigger stories in the environment last year was increasing FI M&A activity, which we expect will continue. We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape. There is no question that digital and, specifically, mobile, is having a dramatic impact on the banking experience. Branches are in decline and the payment world is more dynamic than ever, which we believe will lead to meaningful opportunity.
Financial institutions are increasingly looking at technology providers to help them navigate these changing times. We believe the trends in the market align well with our innovation-based agenda and should drive further growth over the next several years.
With that, let's move to 2016. Our 3 key enterprise priorities, which remained generally unchanged, are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.
For 2016, we expect internal revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 6%. Our road map for revenue acceleration includes continued growth in our scaled, high-quality revenue businesses, incremental contributions from our innovation-based solutions and less negative impact from both currency and the lag between EMV card manufacturing and personalization. As high-quality revenue comes on slowly, we again expect a higher growth rate in the second half of the year, and that will likely build sequentially.
We expect adjusted earnings per share to grow in a range of 12% to 15% or $4.32 to $4.44 for the year. We also expect adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, and that free cash flow per share will be greater than $4.70 for the year.
Lastly, for guidance purposes, we do not expect the ACI asset acquisition to have a material impact on our operating results this year.
On balance, we performed well in 2015 and showcased the power of our business model. Although we fell a bit short on reported revenue, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, drove exceptional operating margin and delivered another year of strong free cash flow. We also added meaningful new innovation to our solution portfolio and are well positioned for the foreseeable future.
Our results are a product of the commitment and dedication of our 21,000 associates around the world who strive to be their best. I'm grateful to be part of a company that delivers today while creating an even brighter tomorrow.
Lastly, as we shared with you in Q3, we expect this to be Tom's final earnings call as our CFO. And we thank him for the many contributions he has made to support the success of our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. On the selection front, we have been very pleased with the significant interest in this important role and are on track to have a successor named and in place this quarter.
With that, Laura, let's open the line for questions."

And most of those impacts, we're doing a lot of the consolidation activities around our data center optimization efforts in '16, which is not going to have the full run rate benefit until largely '17 and '18, and so that's probably the biggest driver in that case because it's a little bit different than the benefits we had in '15, which were focused a lot on procurement.

And some of that is a systems readiness issue and some of that was kind of just the timing with which they wanted to go through with the reissue process. But because of the concerns that have been out there in the industry about the availability of chips, we saw a lot of people pushing for the manufacturing to get done and put that into their inventory in anticipation of needing to get the reissues done. So I think it's a combination of both a lot of internal process differences by clients but, very importantly, concern over not coming up short on the EMV chip availability."

I also think the community, primarily, this is a community bank issue, the community banks are making decisions on the timing of their -- should they do a mass reissue, should they do partial reissues, there are a lot of factors. So you saw the FI landscape kind of ignore the issue, and then, all of a sudden, it became very urgent. And then they bought them, and then they had to think about what's the best way to get them distributed. The other thing to keep in mind is the cards don't have the same level of value if the merchants aren't live on their end. And so we are just really seeing -- and you're probably -- we're all seeing it every once in a while now, finally, a merchant says, ""All right, well, you have to put your card into the machine."" So that landscape is coming together, and the end-to-end equation is being built. We expect that will continue to build, and that'll match up well with the institutions deciding to send the cards out to their consumers and get them finally personalized."

We actually talked about 12, but we highlighted 6. And so from each of those 6 areas: Agiliti; DNA; EMV; NOW; Integrated Payments, or IPS; and Mobiliti, we see each of those areas contributing some level of incremental growth in '16. It won't surprise you to know we're not going to talk about it specifically, but on an order of magnitude basis, we did lay out at Investor Day how we saw the ramp coming year-over-year. And so we expect some incremental benefit in '16, even more in '17, even more in '18. So we have a high degree of confidence and visibility that, that's going to happen. So that's point one. Point two is we expect to have a little less drag from FX. We expect to not be surprised by this lag between EMV card manufacturing and EMV card personalization. So we think that will turn as well.

So there's a lot of talk around real-time core systems and there is a lot of looking going on -- or there's not a lot -- not a lot relative numbers, but a lot on a relative basis to what we've seen historically for larger institutions looking at what would it take to convert real-time. There's a couple of larger mid-tiers that are in the process of doing conversions right now. And so there is focus out there. We see some of the more progressive institutions in the $1 billion to $10 billion space taking a look at that, but we haven't seen beyond DNA. We've not seen a lot of movement in the market. And frankly, as I sit here today and I think about the larger transactions that have been done over the last 3 or 4 years, I can't think of a -- I honestly cannot think of a real-time solution that we did not win that went to anyone else. And so I only raise that because the other solutions that are being chosen are not real-time. So that means -- that may mean that the real-time is still early, or it may mean that our solution on a real-time basis is one of the better solutions in the market. It's probably a little bit of both. So I think it's still very early in that genesis. Remember that on the credit union side of the community base, institutions base, they're all real-time and the old thrifts are real-time. So you really have what -- the core banking world as the focus for real-time. And I think we'll continue to see that over the next 3 to 5 years, but we're early."

So you'll remember when we laid this out at our Investor Day in June, we laid out kind of a year-by-year view and that there would be 2 sources of revenue that we thought we would benefit from. We thought we would benefit from the EMV card issuance itself, which is both the manufacturing and the personalization, and we believed that we would also benefit as cards got into force and we were processing those debit or credit transactions, that we would have a small lift on our processing revenue. And that, over time, that piece especially would build. We also anticipated that EMV would primarily happen between '15 and '17. And we're not coming off that view at this stage. I want to -- sorry, and then when we get to full bow, because these cards expire like every other cards expire, that we will get into a very natural reissue cycle as we've always been in. And so while there may be a slight hump in a quarter or in quarters, that we don't see that to be having a meaningful -- strike that, a material impact on our comps moving forward. Now if every single institution decides to issue in the middle of Q3 in '17 -- '16, that could create a problem. We don't see that happening. I think it's highly unlikely and I don't think anyone could actually make that happen from a manufacturing and personalization perspective. That's a long-winded way of saying we can't predict the future. I can't tell you what's going to happen on quarterly comps for sure. But on a year-by-year basis, I feel like once we get into '17 that we're going to see -- definitely see that smoothing that we laid out at Investor Day.

As we look out I think longer, and Jeff just really hit on the EMV side of this, but if you look at different things like IPS, or you look at things like Agiliti, or you look at things like the NOW Network, those are factored in over those longer period cycles, which is '16, '17, '18, '19, because we're really trying to build this base of 50 to 100 basis points on average each year.

Bob has been with us for about 2 months and is quickly getting up to speed. We're excited by the skills and experience he brings to the company.
Now on to the results. We're pleased with our start as each of our key financial metrics were ahead of plan for the quarter. And importantly, we're right on track to meet our financial commitments for the full year.
Internal revenue growth was a solid 4%, which included 170 basis points of drag from the timing of license related revenue, EMV personalization deferral and the negative impact of FX in the quarter. Growth and adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow per share were stellar, each up 19% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was also strong, increasing 80 basis points over the prior year.
We were again, for the third year in a row, named one of FORTUNE magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. For the first time, we were recognized as the top company for innovation within the financial data services category. We are honored by this -- which recognizes our culture of driving value for clients, associates and shareholders.
As you will recall, we shared 3 key priorities for 2016 to help you gauge our progress which, as a reminder, are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.
Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter. We saw strong performance in areas such as card services, electronic payments, lending and Output Solutions. We expect to see continued revenue acceleration throughout the year, notably being driven by strong performance in our recurring revenue businesses.
Adjusted operating income was up 8%, largely resulting from growth in high-quality revenue and a continuing focus on operational efficiency. Adjusted EPS and free cash flow per share were both up 19% for the quarter, not including the $140 million cash distribution received from our StoneRiver joint venture. Again, we're on pace to achieve our financial goals for the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We scheduled our earnings call a bit later this quarter to accommodate a forum, our Spring Client Conference held last week. We were pleased to have nearly 4,000 people experiencing Fiserv, including educational sessions, networking and over 170 technology solutions on display to help our clients deliver the experiences that their customers are looking for today. The convergence of mobile inconveniences having a meaningful effect on consumer expectations for speed, ease and access. Fiserv has been focused on innovation designed to address these burgeoning demands.
Two new solutions, CardValet and Immediate Funds, were recipients of the 2016 payments.com innovation awards in their in respective categories. These awards recognize potentially disruptive, highly differentiated technologies and are real-world examples of how our solutions enable clients to provide superior value to the customers they serve.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers were up nearly 40% from the prior year and 9% sequentially to more than 4.5 million users, reflecting continuing strong demand for mobile services. We remain confident that mobile subscriber growth will be substantial over the next several years as adoption levels continue to accelerate. In addition, Mobiliti is a catalyst for driving value-added some transactions such as mobile capture, bill payment and Popmoney.
We're seeing strong demand for EMV issuance and expect that to continue for several years, especially with the eventuality of contactless technologies. And still, we've not yet reached the tipping point where card manufacturing and card personalization or equal. As a result, we deferred an additional $5 million of revenue in the quarter. We expect card personalization trends to continue improving in the second half of the year, which should lead to further acceleration in EMV revenue.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Vibrant Credit Union became the 48th new DNA client to go live since the Open Solutions acquisition. DNA serves as the technology foundation for Vibrant to deliver differentiated products, services and experiences to its more than 41,000 members. Vibrant management cited DNA's superior agility, flexibility and speed of customization as key factors in converting from a well-known competitive offering, primarily serving larger credit unions. We expect this conversion to provide additional proof points to further fuel momentum in the large credit union space.
Our DNA pipeline has continued to grow, with a bias to larger banks and credit unions as technology buyers see value in a real-time modern platform. Implementations are progressing nicely, with more than 20 new DNA clients, including 8 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion expected to go live in 2016. Importantly, as new account processing clients tend to select a broad suite of solutions, revenue in both segments should benefit as implementations come on throughout the year.
Last week we also announced an important partnership with AFS to integrate their sophisticated commercial lending services into our account processing platforms. We believe offering these market-leading capabilities in an on-demand, cost-effective manner will even further enhance our competitive position in the larger end of the market.
Lastly, we closed 2 acquisitions we have previously announced during the quarter. In January, we completed a small biller solutions acquisition that expands our capabilities through a modern, SaaS platform and provides access to new verticals for payment acceptance. And in early March, we closed the acquisition of ACI Worldwide's Community Financial Services business. This transaction adds digital banking clients and some unique capabilities including architects, an integrated online and mobile banking solution serving retail and business customers on a single platform. We expect these acquisitions to contribute $75 million to $85 million of adjusted revenue in 2016, and that the adjusted EPS contribution to be fairly minimal as synergies ramp late in the year and then into 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."

It's been an exciting couple of months learning the business, meeting people and looking for ways in which my experience has complemented Fiserv's business.

It's been an exciting couple of months learning the business, meeting people and looking for ways in which my experience has complemented Fiserv's business. I'd really like what I've seen so far and look forward to meeting you in the near future as we continue to deliver value to clients, associates and you, as shareholders.
Now turning to a little more detail in the first quarter results. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion and internal revenue growth was 4%. As Jeff mentioned, internal revenue growth performance was strong especially considering several items that, together, negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 170 basis points in the quarter; 110 basis points from the timing of license-related revenue in the Financial segment; 40 basis points from the EMV revenue deferral; and 20 basis points related to currency.
Our high-quality revenue growth, combined with continued discipline and operating efficiency, drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $399 million.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 19% to $1.06, and free cash flow per share was also up 19% to $1.31. Adjusted operating margin was strong in the quarter, up 80 basis points over the prior year to 31.9%.
As you've seen, we're off to a great start in the Payments segment. Adjusted revenue, which includes a partial quarter contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 9% to $671 million. Internal revenue growth was up a strong 7% in the segment. Debit transactions grew in a high single digits over last year's comparable quarter and we continue to gain traction in our bundled debit credit offering. Not only should this proposition drive the debit business, but also extends our credit processing footprint to capitalize on the growth potential in our client base. Solutions such as CardValet and CardFree Cash enhance the traditional card-based value proposition and creates quality revenue for our clients.
Looking beyond the point-of-sale, we added more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter, signed nearly 100 institutions for Popmoney and saw our P2P transactions grow 30%. Popmoney Instant transactions were also up 70% for the quarter.
Our Output Solutions business recorded strong growth, even with the EMV personalization revenue deferral. As Jeff referenced earlier, we expect to see the revenue deferrals subside and potential begin to reverse as we expect personalization to accelerate later in the year and into 2017.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was up an impressive 18% to $225 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded a very strong 230 basis points over the prior year. Synergies for our new acquisitions, which are included in the Payments segment, should ramp as we exit 2016. Therefore, we expect roughly a 60 basis point negative impact on the segment margin this year.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 1% to $599 million. Revenue growth in the segment was negatively impacted by 220 basis points due to a decrease in higher margin license-related revenue as compared to last year. On the plus side, we saw good performance in our lending and international businesses in the quarter. And we expect revenue acceleration in the second half of the year due to the rollout of new technology solutions, the timing of license-related revenue and new client implementations.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million and adjusted operating margin was 32.6%. Lower comparable results in the quarter were primarily from the timing of higher-margin license-related revenue, negative impact of FX and the timing of innovation-based investments in solutions, such as Agiliti and Notifi. We expect much stronger results in the second half of the year.
Corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was basically in line with the prior year's results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 33%. And we benefited from timing of expected discrete tax benefits, which when compared to the prior year provided about $0.03 of adjusted EPS improvement in the quarter. The Q1 rate is consistent with our 2016 guidance and we continue to anticipate a full year adjusted effective tax rate of about 35%.
Free cash flow grew 11% in the quarter to $298 million, and was up 19% on a per share basis to $1.31. These excellent results are primarily due to high-quality revenue growth and disciplined capital allocation.
We recorded a net gain of $146 million and received $140 million of cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture related to the sale of our business interest. Both the gain and related cash distribution are excluded from reported adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. A census suspension was formed in 2008, we realized $1.1 billion including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest. Although there are only limited assets remaining this venture, we're very pleased with its overall performance.
Total debt as of March 31 was $4.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares in the quarter at an average cost of $92 per share for just over $320 million. At quarter-end, there were 223 million shares outstanding and 14 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

Following our record sales performance in Q4, our results were somewhat slow coming in at 70% of quota for the quarter. That said, activity levels continue to be very strong in the quarter, with our domestic pipeline up 14% since December 31 and up 26% year-over-year. We anticipate a number of significant wins over the next couple of quarters and fully expect to achieve our sales goals for the year.
Integrated sales are the key part of our product distribution strategy and was up 10% to $48 million for the quarter, led by card services, bill payment and channels.
We're in the first year of our new $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our goal for this year is $40 million, and we achieved $10 million of savings in the first quarter, driven primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We're also progressing very well in our data center program, which we expect will provide meaningful operational savings in the future.
Even as banks prognosticate on interest rate increases, we are seeing an important bias to action in driving online and mobile solutions. Customer expectations are ratcheting up and that translates to opportunities to further differentiate our broad catalog of solutions, including channels, payments and account processing. Speaking of payments, we're seeing an increased focus on payments beyond the point-of-sale. As you know, we have been preparing for this movement and we are encouraged by the industry dialogue with an emphasis across the largest banks. We expect these plans to solidify over the next 12 months and believe we will play an important role in the ultimate solution.
As I mentioned, we are on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, which includes internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 12% to 15% in a range of $4.32 to $4.44.
Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full year results to bias above the midpoint of the range and that the adjusted EPS growth rate will be generally equivalent between the first and second halves of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, even with the approximately 30 basis points of acquisition margin pressure Bob mentioned earlier. And importantly, we still expect free cash flow per share for the full year to be at least $4.70.
In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We expect to meet or exceed our financial and strategic commitments, including another step-up in our level of sustainable, high-quality revenue growth. Our ability to excel is based entirely on the dedication, commitment and innovation of our 22,000 associates who band together to achieve client excellence each and every day.
With that, let's open the line for questions."

It was really much more around how strong last year's first quarter was relative to this obviously Q1 in '16, and we expect to see that come back. It wasn't that spending was postponed, it was really just the timing of last year's license-related revenue versus the license-related revenue that we expect for this year. On the question of spending, we're not seeing any change in the environment, certainly no negative change. And in fact, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're actually seeing a pretty clear realization across all segments of the market that -- and this may sound a little bit funny, but that mobile is here to stay. And that of the finding the right way to craft, whether you call it omnichannel or how to find of the points of relationship management between mobile experiences and in-branch experiences and online experiences and teller, whatever other ways -- or I'm sorry, ATM, whatever other way they're coming together, that's a very big focus for the institutions.

So really good growth there. A lot of activity. And I'll tell you, we were really excited about the discussions we had at Forum. We -- in terms of both the innovative products, as well as we had one of the highest numbers of prospects and attendance that we've ever had. In fact, it is the highest we've ever had. So a lot of the dialogue. And we're going to have to find that balance between predictability of when some of these larger transactions are going to happen and how that wraps into the quota. The good news for us is, as you and others know, the substantial majority of the sales revenue that would -- or the sales-related revenue that would come in from these larger transactions has no effect on our current quarter and really very little effect on the full year. So that does give us a little bit of hope on the -- or I'm sorry, gives us a little bit of confidence on the offset. Just one last thing. I would say a couple of the larger transactions that we have on our pipeline that we expect to close in Q2 do have some seasonality benefits that will actually will help us in the second half of the year.

Yes, I mean, there's probably 4 or 5 big areas in which were seeing that you can call out seeing the impact. As Mark was talking about earlier as he talked about prepared remarks, we see EMV being a good-sized chunk of that, both ramped-up demand as well as less of the differential between the manufacturing timing and the personalization timing. So we see that coming in as we mentioned in Qs 2 and 3 but also having a ramp effect in 4. Mobiliti subscriber growth is looking really strong. We were up 9% sequentially. We expect to see a significant amount of growth for that, as you know, with that service as we put the users on the system, it becomes a bit of monthly subscription revenue, so that's good news. Next item is around DNA. As the DNA implementations continue to ramp but not just DNA, it's all account processing implementations. In fact that the end of Q2, our largest implementation of the year will go in. It's actually not a DNA implementations, so we're excited about that. And remember that, that brings in not only revenue in the Financial segment but they tend to be bundled large transactions so they go across the enterprise. And then lastly, we have a series of new initiatives that are just gaining traction. Some of them that we talked about before such as IPS that were seeing good growth. Bob mentioned that in his prepared comments. Agiliti which we've talked about is doing quite well and then something like Notifi, which is an alerting hub, an alerting capability across all of our solutions, which will go live in Q4. Any number of those we expect to help drive that growth. Now remember the difference between -- even between 4% and 5% is not that significant when you think about it on a quarterly basis. Roughly $10 million is 1 point. So it takes a fair number of things to come together but there's no single one item that we're counting on and so it's around the execution of the company. And then as these -- I guess the last thing I would say is as these larger, we talked about both pipeline growth, as these larger transactions get closed, some of them have seasonality benefits. And obviously there'll be a bit of revenue coming in from all of them and while no one of them is probably ""worthy"" of calling out individually, when they come together, there'll be some impact late in the year."

And that's really creating, we think, more opportunity for us and frankly, others, but really for us moving forward because of the pressure on the online channel to keep up with mobile. The other thing to always keep in mind is the reasons why people interact in certain channels are not the same. So checking my balance is something I might do on a mobile device. But a loan application for the most part I'm not going to do on -- my kids might do it on their mobile device but I'm not going to.

We don't see ACH being really a viable point-of-sale alternative.

Bob has been with us for about 2 months and is quickly getting up to speed. We're excited by the skills and experience he brings to the company.
Now, on to the results. We're pleased with our start as each of our key financial metrics were ahead of plan for the quarter. And importantly, we're right on track to meet our financial commitments for the full year.
Internal revenue growth was a solid 4%, which included 170 basis points of drag from the timing of license-related revenue, EMV personalization deferral and the negative impact of FX in the quarter. Growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow per share were stellar, each up 19% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was also strong, increasing 80 basis points over the prior year.
We were again, for the third year in a row, named one of FORTUNE magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. For the first time, we were recognized as the top company for innovation within the financial data services category. We are honored by this 3P, which recognizes our culture of driving value for clients, associates and shareholders.
As you will recall, we shared 3 key priorities for 2016 to help you gauge our progress which, as a reminder, are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.
Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter. We saw strong performance in areas such as card services, electronic payments, lending and Output Solutions. We expect to see continued revenue acceleration throughout the year, notably being driven by strong performance in our recurring revenue businesses.
Adjusted operating income was up 8%, largely resulting from growth in high-quality revenue and a continuing focus on operational efficiency. Adjusted EPS and free cash flow per share were both up 19% for the quarter, not including the $140 million cash distribution received from our StoneRiver joint venture. Again, we're on pace to achieve our financial goals for the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We scheduled our earnings call a bit later this quarter to accommodate forum. Our Spring Client Conference held last week. We were pleased to have nearly 4,000 people experiencing Fiserv, including educational sessions, networking and over 170 technology solutions on display to help our clients deliver the experiences that their customers are looking for today. The convergence of mobile and convenience is having a meaningful effect on consumer expectations for speed, ease and access. Fiserv has been focused on innovation designed to address these burgeoning demands.
Two new solutions, CardValet and Immediate Funds, were recipients of the 2016 PYMNTS.com innovation awards in their respective categories. These awards recognize potentially disruptive, highly differentiated technologies and are real-world examples of how our solutions enable clients to provide superior value to the customers they serve.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers were up nearly 40% from the prior year and 9% sequentially to more than 4.5 million users, reflecting continuing strong demand for mobile services. We remain confident that mobile subscriber growth will be substantial over the next several years as adoption levels continue to accelerate. In addition, Mobiliti is a catalyst for driving value-added transactions such as mobile capture, bill payment and Popmoney.
We're seeing strong demand for EMV issuance and expect that to continue for several years, especially with the eventuality of contactless technologies. And still, we've not yet reached the tipping point where card manufacturing and card personalization or equal. As a result, we deferred an additional $5 million of revenue in the quarter. We expect card personalization trends to continue improving in the second half of the year, which should lead to further acceleration in EMV revenue.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Vibrant Credit Union became the 48th new DNA client to go live since the Open Solutions acquisition. DNA serves as the technology foundation for Vibrant to deliver differentiated products, services and experiences to its more than 41,000 members. Vibrant management cited DNA's superior agility, flexibility and speed of customization as key factors in converting from a well-known competitive offering, primarily serving larger credit unions. We expect this conversion to provide additional proof points to further fuel momentum in the large credit union space.
Our DNA pipeline has continued to grow, with a bias to larger banks and credit unions as technology buyers see value in a real-time modern platform. Implementations are progressing nicely with more than 20 new DNA clients, including 8 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion expected to go live in 2016. Importantly, as new account processing clients tend to select broad suites of solutions, revenue in both segments should benefit as implementations come on throughout the year.
Last week, we also announced an important partnership with AFS to integrate their sophisticated commercial lending services into our account processing platforms. We believe offering these market-leading capabilities in an on-demand, cost-effective manner will even further enhance our competitive position in the larger end of the market.
Lastly, we closed 2 acquisitions we had previously announced during the quarter. In January, we completed a small biller solutions acquisition that expands our capabilities through our modern SaaS platform and provides access to new verticals for payment acceptance. And in early March, we closed the acquisition of ACI Worldwide's Community Financial Services business. This transaction adds digital banking clients and some unique capabilities, including Architect, an integrated online and mobile banking solution serving retail and business customers on a single platform. We expect these acquisitions to contribute $75 million to $85 million of adjusted revenue in 2016, and that the adjusted EPS contribution to be fairly minimal as synergies ramp late in the year and then into 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,330011543,974893,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been an exciting couple of months learning the business, meeting people and looking for ways in which my experiences complement Fiserv's business.

It's been an exciting couple of months learning the business, meeting people and looking for ways in which my experiences complement Fiserv's business. I really like what I've seen so far and look forward to meeting you in the near future as we continue to deliver value to clients, associates and you, our shareholders.
Now turning to a little more detail in the first quarter results. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion and internal revenue growth was 4%. As Jeff mentioned, internal revenue growth performance was strong, especially considering several items that together negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 170 basis points in the quarter, 110 basis points from the timing of license-related revenue in the Financial segment, 40 basis points from the EMV revenue deferral and 20 basis points related to currency.
Our high-quality revenue growth, combined with continued discipline and operating efficiency, drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $399 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 19% to $1.06, and free cash flow per share was also up 19% to $1.31. Adjusted operating margin was strong in the quarter, up 80 basis points over the prior year to 31.9%.
As you've seen, we're off to a great start in the Payments segment. Adjusted revenue, which includes a partial quarter contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 9% to $671 million. Internal revenue growth was up a strong 7% in the segment. Debit transactions grew in a high single digits over last year's comparable quarter, and we continue to gain traction in our bundled debit credit offering. Not only should this proposition drive the debit business but also extends our credit processing footprint to capitalize on the growth potential in our client base. Solutions such as CardValet and CardFree Cash enhance the traditional card-based value proposition and creates quality revenue for our clients.
Looking beyond the point-of-sale, we added more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter, signed nearly 100 institutions for Popmoney and saw P2P transactions grow 30%. Popmoney Instant transactions were also up 70% for the quarter.
Our Output Solutions business recorded strong growth, even with the EMV personalization revenue deferral. As Jeff referenced earlier, we expect to see the revenue deferrals subside and potential begin to reverse as we expect personalization to accelerate later in the year and into 2017.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was up an impressive 18% to $225 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded a very strong 230 basis points over the prior year. Synergies for our new acquisitions, which are included in the Payments segment, should ramp as we exit 2016. Therefore, we expect roughly a 60 basis point negative impact on the segment margin this year.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 1% to $599 million. Revenue growth in the segment was negatively impacted by 220 basis points due to a decrease in higher margin license-related revenue as compared to last year. On the plus side, we saw good performance in our lending and international businesses in the quarter. And we expect revenue acceleration in the second half of the year due to the rollout of new technology solutions, the timing of license-related revenue and new client implementations.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million and adjusted operating margin was 32.6%. Lower comparable results in the quarter were primarily from the timing of high margin license-related revenue, negative impact of FX and the timing of innovation-based investments in solutions, such as Agiliti and Notifi. We expect much stronger results in the second half of the year.
Corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was basically in line with the prior year's results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 33%, and we benefited from timing of expected discrete tax benefits, which when compared to the prior year provided about $0.03 of adjusted EPS improvement in the quarter. The Q1 rate is consistent with our 2016 guidance, and we continue to anticipate a full year adjusted effective tax rate of about 35%.
Free cash flow grew 11% in the quarter to $298 million and was up 19% on a per share basis to $1.31. These excellent results are primarily due to high-quality revenue growth and disciplined capital allocation.
We recorded a net gain of $146 million and received $140 million of cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture related to the sale of our business interest. Both the gain and related cash distribution are excluded from reported adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. I sense this venture was formed in 2008. We've realized $1.1 billion including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest. Although there are only limited assets remaining in this venture, we're very pleased with its overall performance.
Total debt as of March 31 was $4.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares in the quarter at an average cost of $92 per share for just over $320 million. At quarter-end, there were 223 million shares outstanding and 14 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

Following our record sales performance in Q4, our results were somewhat slow coming in at 70% of quota for the quarter. That said, activity levels continue to be very strong in the quarter, with our domestic pipeline up 14% since December 31 and up 26% year-over-year. We anticipate a number of significant wins over the next couple of quarters and fully expect to achieve our sales goals for the year.
Integrated sales are the key part of our product distribution strategy and was up 10% to $48 million for the quarter, led by card services, bill payment and channels.
We're in the first year of our new $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our goal for this year is $40 million, and we achieved $10 million of savings in the first quarter, driven primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We're also progressing very well in our data center program which we expect will provide meaningful operational savings in the future.
Even as banks prognosticate on interest rate increases, we are seeing an important bias to action in driving online and mobile solutions. Customer expectations are ratcheting up, and that translates to opportunities to further differentiate our broad catalog of solutions, including channels, payments and account processing. Speaking of payments, we're seeing an increased focus on payments beyond the point-of-sale. As you know, we have been preparing for this movement, and we are encouraged by the industry dialogue with an emphasis across the largest banks. We expect these plans to solidify over the next 12 months and believe we will play an important role in the ultimate solution.
As I mentioned, we are on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, which includes internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 12% to 15% in a range of $4.32 to $4.44.
Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full year results to bias above the midpoint of the range and that the adjusted EPS growth rate will be generally equivalent between the first and second halves of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, even with the approximately 30 basis points of acquisition margin pressure Bob mentioned earlier. And importantly, we still expect free cash flow per share for the full year to be at least $4.70.
In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We expect to meet or exceed our financial and strategic commitments, including another step-up in our level of sustainable, high-quality revenue growth. Our ability to excel is based entirely on the dedication, commitment and innovation of our 22,000 associates who band together to achieve client excellence each and every day.
With that, let's open the line for questions."

It was really much more around how strong last year's first quarter was relative to this obviously Q1 in '16, and we expect to see that come back. It wasn't that spending was postponed. It was really just the timing of last year's license-related revenue versus the license-related revenue that we expect for this year. On the question of spending, we're not seeing any change in the environment, certainly no negative change. And in fact, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're actually seeing a pretty clear realization across all segments of the market that -- and this may sound a little bit funny, but that mobile is here to stay. And that the finding the right way to craft, whether you call it omnichannel or how to find the points of relationship management between mobile experiences and in-branch experiences and online experiences and teller, whatever other ways -- or I'm sorry, ATM, whatever other way they're coming together, that's a very big focus for the institutions. And that also links to the need to provide real-time information. It's putting -- we think it's actually helping us a lot on the modern platform side. So those platforms, such as DNA that are modern, we're getting a lot of attention. So from that perspective, the spend trends are quite solid right now."

We -- in terms of both the innovative products as well as we had one of the highest numbers of prospects and attendance that we've ever had. In fact, it is the highest we've ever had. So a lot of good dialogue. And we're going to have to find that balance between predictability of when some of these larger transactions are going to happen and how that wraps into the quota. The good news for us is, as you and others know, the substantial majority of the sales revenue that would come -- or the sales-related revenue that would come in from these larger transactions has no effect on our current quarter and really very little effect on the full year. So that does give us a little bit of hope on the -- or I'm sorry, gives us a little bit of confidence on the opposite. Just one last thing. I would say a couple of the larger transactions that we have in our pipeline that we expect to close in Q2 do have some seasonality benefits that we will actually -- will help us in the second half of the year. So we're feeling good about where we are from a sales standpoint."

And you've always had to find that balance in any kind of seller-buyer negotiation. That tends to not be the issue in these larger transactions. They tend to be far more around the readiness of the buyer to develop their plans enough because, as you know, a lot of the larger transactions for us tend to be big, mission-critical systems. And so it takes a long time for the buyers to get comfortable. And then there's always a lot of negotiation on normal Ts and Cs. So they just tend to take longer from that standpoint not from pricing. When pricing is a problem, that usually actually rears its head pretty early in the process."

Yes, I mean, there's probably 4 or 5 big areas in which we're seeing that you can call out seeing the impact. As Mark was talking about earlier as he talked about prepared remarks, we see EMV being a good-sized chunk of that, both ramped-up demand as well as less of the differential between the manufacturing timing and the personalization timing. So we see that coming in as we mentioned in Qs 2 and 3 but also having a ramp effect in 4. Mobiliti subscriber growth is looking really strong. We were up 9% sequentially. We expect to see a significant amount of growth for that, as you know, with that service. As we put the users on the system, it becomes a bit of monthly subscription revenue, so that's good news. Next item is around DNA. As the DNA implementations continue to ramp -- but not just DNA, it's all account processing implementations. In fact at the end of Q2, our largest implementation of the year will go in. It's actually not a DNA implementation. So we're excited about that. And remember that, that brings in not only revenue in the Financial segment, but they tend to be bundled large transactions so they go across the enterprise. And then lastly, we have a series of new initiatives that are just gaining traction. Some of them that we talked about before, such as IPS that were seeing good growth, Bob mentioned that in his prepared comments. Agiliti which we've talked about is doing quite well. And then something like Notifi, which is an alerting hub, an alerting capability across all of our solutions, which will go live in Q4. Any number of those we expect to help drive that growth. Now remember the difference between -- even between 4% and 5% is not that significant when you think about it on a quarterly basis. Roughly $10 million is 1 point. So it takes a fair number of things to come together, but there's no single one item that we're counting on and so it's around the execution of the company. And then as these -- I guess the last thing I would say is as these larger -- we talked about both pipeline growth, as these larger transactions get closed, some of them have seasonality benefits. And obviously there'll be a bit of revenue coming in from all of them. And while no one of them is probably ""worthy"" of calling out individually, when they come together, there'll have some impact late in the year."

And you can see -- if you're doing industry reading and outside the industry, a lot of discussion on making sure that you have an online experience that is consistent with the tablet and mobile experiences. And that's really creating, we think, more opportunity for us, and frankly others, but really for us moving forward because of the pressure on the online channel to keep up with mobile. The other thing to always keep in mind is the reasons why people interact in certain channels are not the same. So checking my balance is something I might do on a mobile device. But a loan application, for the most part, I'm not going to do on -- my kids might do it on their mobile device but I'm not going to. Only to say that for a long time, although this is merging a bit, for a long time, we talked about mobile more as a snack metaphor and online being a little bit more of a meal metaphor. So you've got different kinds of activities and duration of experience going on in both of those places."

That will especially be important on mobile because it's hard to move through tabs and things like that. But on balance, we're getting exposure to many more users, and we're seeing a lot more interest in the product. And then lastly, there's a macro that's going on, where the larger banks are putting more and more emphasis on P2P. I think there is a movement in the industry right now to make sure frankly that P2P remains bank-centric. We've been pushing on that for several years, and we are absolutely committed to making sure that, that happens. So there's a lot of movement -- macro movement that haven't seen in a long time, and we're excited about it. We think it's going to play out in a pretty interesting way over the next year."

So we're happy that the industry is adopting it. We see a lot of great opportunity to use ACH in different ways. In terms of being able to meet the demands of consumers who are really far more focused on speed, ease and convenience, and ACH is a reasonable way to do that. We don't see ACH being really a viable point-of-sale alternative. What we do see, if you have a bill that you want to move quickly, we see that same day can be quite valuable there or emergency payrolls and all kinds of other things, so we're optimistic about that. I don't -- things like CardFree Cash that we're working that will be going over the card network. So it's a little bit of a different animal.

Bob has been with us for about 2 months and is quickly getting up to speed. We're excited about the skills and experience he brings to the company.
Now, on to the results. We're pleased with our start as each of our key financial metrics were ahead of plan for the quarter. And importantly, we're right on track to meet our financial commitments for the full year.
Internal revenue growth was a solid 4%, which included 170 basis points of drag from the timing of license-related revenue, EMV personalization deferral and the negative impact of FX in the quarter. Growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow per share were stellar, each up 19% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was also strong, increasing 80 basis points over the prior year.
We were again, for the third year in a row, named one of FORTUNE magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. For the first time, we were recognized as the top company for innovation within the financial data services category. We are honored by this three-peat, which recognizes our culture of driving value for clients, associates and shareholders.
As you will recall, we shared 3 key priorities for 2016 to help you gauge our progress which, as a reminder, are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.
Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter. We saw strong performance in areas such as card services, electronic payments, lending and Output Solutions. We expect to see continued revenue acceleration throughout the year, notably being driven by strong performance in our recurring revenue businesses.
Adjusted operating income was up 8%, largely resulting from growth in high-quality revenue and a continuing focus on operational efficiency. Adjusted EPS and free cash flow per share were both up 19% for the quarter, not including the $140 million cash distribution received from our StoneRiver joint venture. Again, we're on pace to achieve our financial goals for the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We scheduled our earnings call a bit later this quarter to accommodate Forum, our Spring Client Conference held last week. We were pleased to have nearly 4,000 people experiencing Fiserv, including educational sessions, networking and over 170 technology solutions on display to help our clients deliver the experiences that their customers are looking for today. The convergence of mobile and convenience is having a meaningful effect on consumer expectations for speed, ease and access. Fiserv has been focused on innovation designed to address these burgeoning demands.
Two new solutions, CardValet and Immediate Funds, were recipients of the 2016 PYMNTS.com innovation awards in their respective categories. These awards recognize potentially disruptive, highly differentiated technologies and are real-world examples of how our solutions enable clients to provide superior value to the customers they serve.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers were up nearly 40% from the prior year and 9% sequentially to more than 4.5 million users, reflecting continuing strong demand for mobile services. We remain confident that mobile subscriber growth will be substantial over the next several years as adoption levels continue to accelerate. In addition, Mobiliti is a catalyst for driving value-added transactions such as mobile capture, bill payment and Popmoney.
We're seeing strong demand for EMV issuance and expect that to continue for several years, especially with the eventuality of contactless technologies. And still, we've not yet reached the tipping point where card manufacturing and card personalization are equal. As a result, we deferred an additional $5 million of revenue in the quarter. We expect card personalization trends to continue improving in the second half of the year, which should lead to further acceleration in EMV revenue.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Vibrant Credit Union became the 48th new DNA client to go live since the Open Solutions acquisition. DNA serves as the technology foundation for Vibrant to deliver differentiated products, services and experiences to its more than 41,000 members. Vibrant management cited DNA's superior agility, flexibility and speed of customization as key factors in converting from a well-known competitive offering, primarily serving larger credit unions. We expect this conversion to provide additional proof points to further fuel momentum in the large credit union space.
Our DNA pipeline has continued to grow, with a bias to larger banks and credit unions as technology buyers see value in a real-time modern platform. Implementations are progressing nicely with more than 20 new DNA clients, including 8 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion expected to go live in 2016. Importantly, as new account processing clients tend to select broad suites of solutions, revenue in both segments should benefit as implementations come on throughout the year.
Last week, we also announced an important partnership with AFS to integrate their sophisticated commercial lending services into our account processing platforms. We believe offering these market-leading capabilities in an on-demand, cost-effective manner will even further enhance our competitive position in the larger end of the market.
Lastly, we closed 2 acquisitions we had previously announced during the quarter. In January, we completed a small biller solutions acquisition that expands our capabilities through our modern SaaS platform and provides access to new verticals for payment acceptance. And in early March, we closed the acquisition of ACI Worldwide's Community Financial Services business. This transaction adds digital banking clients and some unique capabilities, including Architect, an integrated online and mobile banking solution serving retail and business customers on a single platform. We expect these acquisitions to contribute $75 million to $85 million of adjusted revenue in 2016, and that the adjusted EPS contribution to be fairly minimal as synergies ramp late in the year and then into 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,330011543,974996,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

It's been an exciting couple of months learning the business, meeting people and looking for ways in which my experiences complement Fiserv's business. I really like what I've seen so far and look forward to meeting you in the near future as we continue to deliver value to clients, associates and you, our shareholders.
Now turning to a little more detail in the first quarter results. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion and internal revenue growth was 4%. As Jeff mentioned, internal revenue growth performance was strong, especially considering several items that together negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 170 basis points in the quarter, 110 basis points from the timing of license-related revenue in the Financial segment, 40 basis points from the EMV revenue deferral and 20 basis points related to currency.
Our high-quality revenue growth, combined with continued discipline and operating efficiency, drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $399 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 19% to $1.06, and free cash flow per share was also up 19% to $1.31. Adjusted operating margin was strong in the quarter, up 80 basis points over the prior year to 31.9%.
As you've seen, we're off to a great start in the Payments segment. Adjusted revenue, which includes a partial quarter contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 9% to $671 million. Internal revenue growth was up a strong 7% in the segment. Debit transactions grew in the high single digits over last year's comparable quarter, and we continue to gain traction in our bundled debit credit offering. Not only should this proposition drive the debit business but also extends our credit processing footprint to capitalize on the growth potential in our client base. Solutions such as CardValet and CardFree Cash enhance the traditional card-based value proposition and creates quality revenue for our clients.
Looking beyond the point-of-sale, we added more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter, signed nearly 100 institutions for Popmoney and saw P2P transactions grow 30%. Popmoney Instant transactions were also up 70% for the quarter.
Our Output Solutions business recorded strong growth, even with the EMV personalization revenue deferral. As Jeff referenced earlier, we expect to see the revenue deferrals subside and potentially begin to reverse as we expect personalization to accelerate later in the year and into 2017.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was up an impressive 18% to $225 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded a very strong 230 basis points over the prior year. Synergies for our new acquisitions, which are included in the Payments segment, should ramp as we exit 2016. Therefore, we expect roughly a 60 basis point negative impact on the segment margin this year.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 1% to $599 million. Revenue growth in the segment was negatively impacted by 220 basis points due to a decrease in higher margin license-related revenue as compared to last year. On the plus side, we saw good performance in our lending and international businesses in the quarter. And we expect revenue acceleration in the second half of the year due to the rollout of new technology solutions, the timing of license-related revenue and new client implementations.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $195 million and adjusted operating margin was 32.6%. Lower comparable results in the quarter were primarily from the timing of high margin license-related revenue, negative impact of FX and the timing of innovation-based investments in solutions, such as Agiliti and Notifi. We expect much stronger results in the second half of the year.
Corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was basically in line with the prior year's results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 33%, and we benefited from timing of expected discrete tax benefits, which when compared to the prior year provided about $0.03 of adjusted EPS improvement in the quarter. The Q1 rate is consistent with our 2016 guidance, and we continue to anticipate a full year adjusted effective tax rate of about 35%.
Free cash flow grew 11% in the quarter to $298 million and was up 19% on a per share basis to $1.31. These excellent results are primarily due to high-quality revenue growth and disciplined capital allocation.
We recorded a net gain of $146 million and received $140 million of cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture related to the sale of our business interest. Both the gain and related cash distribution are excluded from reported adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. And since this venture was formed in 2008. We've realized $1.1 billion including the proceeds from the original sale of our 51% interest. Although there are only limited assets remaining in this venture, we're very pleased with its overall performance.
Total debt as of March 31 was $4.4 billion or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares in the quarter at an average cost of $92 per share for just over $320 million. At quarter-end, there were 223 million shares outstanding and 14 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

That said, activity levels continue to be very strong in the quarter, with our domestic pipeline up 14% since December 31 and up 26% year-over-year. We anticipate a number of significant wins over the next couple of quarters and fully expect to achieve our sales goals for the year.
Integrated sales is a key part of our product distribution strategy and was up 10% to $48 million for the quarter, led by card services, bill payment and channels.
We're in the first year of our new $250 million Operational Effectiveness program. Our goal for this year is $40 million, and we achieved $10 million of savings in the first quarter, driven primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We're also progressing very well in our data center program which we expect will provide meaningful operational savings in the future.
Even as banks prognosticate on interest rate increases, we are seeing an important bias to action in driving online and mobile solutions. Customer expectations are ratcheting up, and that translates to opportunities to further differentiate our broad catalog of solutions, including channels, payments and account processing. Speaking of payments, we're seeing an increased focus on payments beyond the point-of-sale. As you know, we have been preparing for this movement, and we are encouraged by the industry dialogue with an emphasis across the largest banks. We expect these plans to solidify over the next 12 months and believe we will play an important role in the ultimate solution.
As I mentioned, we are on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, which includes internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 12% to 15% in a range of $4.32 to $4.44.
Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full year results to bias above the midpoint of the range and that the adjusted EPS growth rate will be generally equivalent between the first and second halves of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, even with the approximately 30 basis points of acquisition margin pressure Bob mentioned earlier. And importantly, we still expect free cash flow per share for the full year to be at least $4.70.
In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We expect to meet or exceed our financial and strategic commitments, including another step-up in our level of sustainable, high-quality revenue growth. Our ability to excel is based entirely on the dedication, commitment and innovation of our 22,000 associates who band together to achieve client excellence each and every day.
With that, let's open the line for questions."

It was really much more around how strong last year's first quarter was relative to this obviously Q1 in '16, and we expect to see that come back. It wasn't that spending was postponed. It was really just the timing of last year's license-related revenue versus the license-related revenue that we expect for this year. On the question of spending, we're not seeing any change in the environment, certainly no negative change. And in fact, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we're actually seeing a pretty clear realization across all segments of the market that -- and this may sound a little bit funny, but that mobile is here to stay. And that the finding the right way to craft, whether you call it omnichannel or how to find the points of relationship management between mobile experiences and in-branch experiences and online experiences and teller, whatever other ways -- or I'm sorry, ATM, whatever other way they're coming together, that's a very big focus for the institutions. And that also links to the need to provide real-time information. It's putting -- we think it's actually helping us a lot on the modern platform side. So those platforms such as DNA that are modern, we're getting a lot of attention. So from that perspective, the spend trends are quite solid right now."

So really good growth there. A lot of activity. And I'll tell you, we were really excited about the discussions we had at Forum. We -- in terms of both the innovative products as well as we had one of the highest numbers of prospects and attendance that we've ever had. In fact, it is the highest we've ever had. So a lot of good dialogue. And we're going to have to find that balance between predictability of when some of these larger transactions are going to happen and how that wraps into the quota. The good news for us is, as you and others know, the substantial majority of the sales revenue that would come -- or the sales-related revenue that would come in from these larger transactions has no effect on our current quarter and really very little effect on the full year. So that does give us a little bit of hope on the -- or I'm sorry, gives us a little bit of confidence on the offset. Just one last thing.

Yes, I mean, there's probably 4 or 5 big areas in which we're seeing that you can call out seeing the impact. As Mark was talking about earlier as he talked about prepared remarks, we see EMV being a good-sized chunk of that, both ramped-up demand as well as less of a differential between the manufacturing timing and the personalization timing. So we see that coming in as we mentioned in Qs 2 and 3 but also having a ramp effect in 4. Mobiliti subscriber growth is looking really strong. We were up 9% sequentially. We expect to see a significant amount of growth for that, as you know, with that service, as we put the users on the system, it becomes a bit of monthly subscription revenue, so that's good news. Next item is around DNA. As the DNA implementations continue to ramp -- but not just DNA, it's all account processing implementations. In fact at the end of Q2, our largest implementation of the year will go in. It's actually not a DNA implementation. So we're excited about that. And remember that, that brings in not only revenue in the Financial segment, but they tend to be bundled large transactions so they go across the enterprise. And then lastly, we have a series of new initiatives that are just gaining traction. Some of them that we talked about before, such as IPS that we’re seeing good growth, Bob mentioned that in his prepared comments. Agiliti, which we've talked about, is going quite well. And then something like Notifi, which is an alerting hub, an alerting capability across all of our solutions, which will go live in Q4. Any number of those we expect to help drive that growth. Now remember the difference between -- even between 4% and 5% is not that significant when you think about it on a quarterly basis. Roughly $10 million is 1 point. So it takes a fair number of things to come together, but there's no single one item that we're counting on, and so it's around the execution of the company. And then as these -- I guess the last thing I would say is as these larger -- we talked about both pipeline growth, as these larger transactions get closed, some of them have seasonality benefits. And obviously there'll be a bit of revenue coming in from all of them. And while no one of them is probably ""worthy"" of calling out individually, when they come together, they'll have some impact late in the year."

In terms of being able to meet the demands of consumers who are really far more focused on speed, ease and convenience, and ACH is a reasonable way to do that. We don't see ACH being really a viable point-of-sale alternative. What we do see, if you have a bill that you want to move quickly, we see that same day can be quite valuable there or emergency payrolls and all kinds of other things, so we're optimistic about that. I don't -- things like CardFree Cash will be working -- that will be going over the card network. So it's a little bit of a different animal. I do think that the plumbing, right, the entire infrastructure, the payments infrastructure is being kind of globally re-examined right now. And so there's -- in my mind, there's a lot of puts and takes on how we're all thinking about the plumbing. And I suspect over the next 5, 7 years that it'll play out in a way that looks a little bit different than it looks today."

We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.Internal revenue growth was 4%; adjuste",1070,"Thanks, Stephanie and good afternoon, everyone. We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.
Internal revenue growth was 4%; adjusted operating income margin expanded 10 basis points; and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. Sales performance was strong in the quarter, attaining more than 100% of quota and was 34% ahead of last year's second quarter. Importantly, that momentum carried over into July, producing one of our -- the best sales months in our history.
Given the strength of our results to date and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.38 to $4.45, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year.
Now let me provide an update on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which as a reminder are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, deliver to innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high-quality revenue growth. As such, our internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was highlighted by 6% growth in our Payments segment. We saw a continued strength in our transactional businesses and EMV card distribution. Overall, internal revenue growth in the quarter was comprised by 80 basis points from a combination of lower termination fees, EMV deferral and negative currency impact.
Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points through June 30, in line with our expectations. This was led by strong performance in our Payments segment, which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of 110 and 170 basis points in the quarter and first 6 month of the year, respectively.
As I mentioned, we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a 17% increase in adjusted EPS for the first half of the year. Free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted EPS a bit, up 7% through June, which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of 2016.
We're on -- we're well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. One of our flagship payment technologies is our RXP bill payment solution, with over 25 million active users across more than 4,000 financial institutions, including 8 of the top 10 banks. Bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking. And during the quarter, we were pleased to renew our long-standing client relationships with PNC Bank with $350 billion of assets and SunTrust Bank, with $190 billion in assets.
We've spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our real-time network now through our unique biller relationships. During the quarter, we expanded our network by signing one of the nation's largest wireless providers to process payments on our bill matrix platform. In early July, we also signed one of the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers through a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its numbers with more convenient health insurance payment options. Our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the state's public exchange, insurer side, IDR, company agents and a good number of our more than 23,000 walk-in locations across the country. Payment effectiveness requires scale and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition.
Along those lines, you may have seen we inked an agreement with Early Warning, a bank-owned consortium, to enable clients to participate in an emerging P2P network connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the United States together. This furthers our role as a key enabler connecting and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose.
Demand for EMV issuance has remained strong and card personalization volume is growing. As personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured, the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially but remain at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan. That said, we expect EMV card demand to remain healthy for the next several years and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contacts -- contactless card issuance.
Mobiliti ASP users grew by nearly 40% over the prior year's quarter to 4.8 million users and grew 7% sequentially. We also had strong growth in our Mobiliti business solution, with end users growing more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We're still on the very early stages of the digitization of the bank's most important customers. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. During the quarter, Fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation, including inclusion in the InformationWeek elite 100 list of the most innovative users of business technology. We won Best Use of Technology at the payments.com Alexa Awards by connecting our best-in-market Corillian Solution to Amazon Echo for voice-based financial transactions and information at the speed of thought. Westpac Bank, the second largest bank in Australia, with assets of over AUD 830 billion of Westpac Live was ranked #1 in Forrester's 2016 Global Mobile Banking Functionality Benchmark Report in July. Westpac's mobile banking offering is built on our market-leading Corillian solution and is supported by Fiserv.
To further digitize branch banking, we announced Verifast, our state-of-the-art palm authentication solution. This solution, which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint, enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand. This fast, easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity. We see significant deployment opportunities for the back office, teller line and service desks in the roughly 28,000 branches spanning a nearly 5,000 account processing clients in the U.S.
Lastly, 8 new DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 3 with assets over $1 billion, which brings us to 12 implementations for the year-to-date as compared to 11 in the same period last year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,372081028,1022164,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone.

These results included",1017,"Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results included 80 and 50 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact due to EMV revenue deferrals, reduction in termination fees and FX headwinds. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 6% to $413 million and is up a healthy 7% year-to-date to $812 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 31.9% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, increasing 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, over the prior year periods. These gains are due primarily to strong Payments segment performance and the progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from our acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08 in the quarter. And for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up a robust 17% to $2.14. Our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted EPS outlook for the year.
At the segment level, our Payments business continued to deliver strong results, with internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue, which includes a full quarter's contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 11% in the quarter to $693 million. Performance was led by strong results in card services and Output Solutions including EMV and solid growth in e-payments.
As Jeff mentioned, while we experienced improved to EMV personalization, we still lack manufacturing and as a result, deferred an additional $3 million of revenue in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted revenue is up 10% year-to-date to $1.4 billion.
We further extended existing relationships with our market-leading solutions including signing 45 debit clients, nearly 60 mobile clients and more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits, and P2P transaction growth was again more than 30%.
Importantly, as Jeff noted, we expanded our base of Mobiliti ASP subscribers by nearly 40% in the quarter to 4.8 million. We continue to believe we're in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day-to-day lives.
Payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent, increasing 14% in the quarter to $238 million, and year-to-date was up 16% to $463 million. Segment adjusted operating margin crossed 34% for the first time, expanding 110 basis points to 34.3% and was up 170 basis points to 33.9% for the first half of the year. This strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year. Our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well, and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits rate this year and into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $613 million in the quarter and $1.2 million in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency, implementation timing and a reduction of specialized regulatory-based services and lower termination fees. For the full year, we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year. This is due to -- primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in Q3 of $15 million to $20 million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year, most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses. And while a reduction in termination fee revenue is generally good for the long-term health of the business, it can create compatibility issues as we're seeing this year. That said, we expect to return to more normalized termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect stronger Financial segment growth in the second half of the year as we see higher license-related revenue, new client implementations, revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as Notifi and palm authentication and improved termination fee comparison in Q4.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $202 million in the quarter and $397 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter to 33% but was up 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi.
Corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior year results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than other prior year's comparable rates of 34.6%. And while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year, our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about 36% is significantly higher than last year's adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of 2015, which was just over 34%.
Free cash flow was $442 million during the first half of the year, with the timing of working capital, including receivables and tax payments, impacting the first half of the year results which we expected by the end of the year. Free cash flow per share is up 7% to $1.95 for the first 6 months of the year.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of June 30 or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark, repurchasing 2.8 million shares of stock in the quarter for $283 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares at an average cost of $97 per share. And at quarter's end, there were 220.6 million shares outstanding and 11.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn it -- the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sales momentum continue to be very strong in July. We signed several large transactions, which underpin one of our best single months sales performance in our history. Importantly, several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter. At this point, we fully expect to exceed our sales goals for the year.
Integrated sales were $66 million in the quarter, flat to the prior year, and up 38% sequentially, driven primarily by digital and payment solutions. Delivering value to clients through our add-on solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy. Our Operational Effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter, including measurable progress on our data center optimization program. To date, we've combined 7 centers and expect to complete additional locations, including one of our largest in footprint later this year. While we're deriving some benefit from these actions currently, there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years. That said, we did capture $17 million of sales in the quarter, and through June 30, we've achieved nearly 70% of our full year Operational Effectiveness goal of $40 million.
Q2 had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment. We saw many crash in alternative lending as certain highfliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios. And while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies, we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new innovative technology is significant. Our offerings are well-positioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer, which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape. We also witnessed the volatility of Brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world. Although early, we do not anticipate measurable Brexit impact on our non-U.S. business other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue, which is Incorporated in our full year outlook.
We remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2016 internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year. Given the lower than anticipated termination fees which, as Bob mentioned, is exacerbated in the third quarter, the increased pressure of FX and the effect of a larger EMV revenue deferral, we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards 5% for the full year. We expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in the Q4 compared to Q3 given termination fee comparisons, sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives.
As a result of our strong first half performance, along with anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.38 to $4.45 which is growth of 13% to 15% over the $3.87 in 2015. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, which includes more than 30 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue. And last, we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We exit the first half of the year well-positioned to meet our current financial goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward. As important, we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high-quality internal revenue growth.
Before we go to Q&A, allow me to recognize the more than 22,000 associates who make a difference for our clients through innovation and excellence each and every day. With that, Carrie, let's open the line for questions."

So we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right? We said biasing to 5% for the year. And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit",630,"Yes, that's a great question, Ramsey. So we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right? We said biasing to 5% for the year. And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new life clients, as we've been talking about the last several years. So that points to the majority of the focus on the financial settlement. And our calculus, and we've looked at this a variety of different ways, primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year than we have historically seen and it really comes down to a couple of factors, and let me lay them out. The first one is we've had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares. So we had some regulatory and we talked about the first quarter some license-related revenue that was lumpy in our '15 numbers. And we've had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year. And so we see that easing on both fronts. And therefore, we're already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue. And we would expect as that lumpiness in the prior year went away that we'll got some comparable benefit. The second item, and this is one of the larger ones, is just this -- the continuing growth in our transactional services. Now some of these are certainly on the payments side lending -- I'm sorry, Mobiliti, EMV is where we're talking about the reduction of the deferral but we've also seen very good growth in our lending businesses. Our largest account processing client went live late in Q2, so all of those, we believe, will provide benefit. The next item is you remember back to last year, we had a pretty slow sales year really until Q4 and it was actually primarily in December. Actually December of 2015 was, by far, our largest sales month in history. And as you know, most of our implementations run 6, 9, 12 months or more, so the revenue that we signed last December, it's starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the Financial segment, so we're excited about that. And then lastly, on the sales front, we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year are -- have either unusually short implementation cycle or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we signed them. So in fact, we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in Q4. All of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to. And then lastly, just the compound affect again o f our -- some of our innovation-based initiatives, programs like our integrated payment strategy, Notifi, Agiliti and the like. So we've got a long laundry list knowing that this would be an important point. We've got it -- we've got them recorded and we've got our management teams focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year. But again, the -- I think very importantly, is these growth engines are not one and done engines. These are engines that will sustain. It will give us, we think, very good -- a very good tailwind entering into '16. And then when you combine that with the very good sale -- I mean into '17, I'm sorry. When you combine that with the very good sales performance that we're seeing this year and we expect to see this year, we're pretty bullish on how '17 is starting to stack up."

You'd mentioned there were a couple of puts and takes in terms of why it is up [ph]. On an absolute basis, I think relatively flat versus last year and not growing too fast on a per share basis. Can you visit that? For some reason, I was expecting the EMV revenue deferral to have a somewhat positive impact on cash flow but I might not be getting that correct. Could you go through again just sort of the cash flow dynamics and why you expect them -- what's been weighing on them and why didn't that pick up a little later in the year?"

And they were really the 2 key drivers that I talked about from a working capital standpoint, in terms of accounts receivable as well as the timing of our tax payments that's actually the better weighting on accounts receivable. And yes, you're right. The way to think about EMV, some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue but that has declined pretty precipitously over the last 4 quarters, down only to about $3 million this quarter so not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint. And that receivables collection is really a timing and effect so you're starting to see that collection turn already in July. So those receivables have started to turn into cash already for the third quarter."

Obviously it's kind of a mixed bag, right. On one hand, it's always better to not have termination fee revenue. On the other hand, termination fee revenue tends to have fairly high margins, as you note. You've probably heard in our prepared remarks that we're doing quite a nice job on our Operational Effectiveness program. We're already at about 70% of our whole year target. And the beauty of that is that's real economic benefit that -- the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees. So there is some benefit there. And frankly, as you know well, if you look at the sources of our growth being in the Payments segment, the Payments segment, I think we mentioned in our remarks, crossed over 34% for the first time ever. I mean, those -- that -- the mix of the revenue is actually working quite favorably for us this year. And we're not pulling any levers beyond the normal levers that we always pull.

Where there's a very interesting dynamics going on in the health insurance and therefore, the health payments industry, that we're just starting to play in. We've been farming that space for a number of years. We mentioned we signed one of the largest wireless companies in the U.S., again, to use one of our payment acceptance platforms. And that, we talked about a lot, is an important differentiator in our now strategy. So the ability to route payments, not just through issuers but being able to have issuers consumers and billers using the same real-time ecosystem, you may seen that we signed an arrangement with AWS. So again, building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability. So on the nonissuer side, that's working out quite well. On the issuer side, we're continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience. So mobile, online -- online is getting an interesting wave of at least refreshed lookee loo's saying, ""I've got this really great mobile experience. What do I do with online?"" And then some of our payment capabilities that are -- whether it's our IPS set of capabilities, account transfer. Bill payment, which is still kind of, as I mentioned, the killer app of non-point-of-sale payments. Those are all the areas which we're getting focused and having good interest.

It is our belief that there are roughly 100 person-to-person payments per household per year. So 100 times 110 million households roughly in the U.S. that have an opportunity to be digitized, electronify and move in a different way.

Has that led to a change at all in your area of focus around the core or area of focus around some of the larger banks, some of the ancillary services you may provide some of the larger financials? And then maybe a follow-on would be just on the M&A side again.

So I assume that on the competitive question, you were talking about talking about the guys who bought SunGard. And we don't really compete very much against the SunGard assets and it's -- that is not strategically aligned with where we're focused in the market. So frankly, we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that. And I don't see a lot of parallels between for example what's going on in the P2P space with the Early Warning announcement and our over 2,000 institutions using Popmoney and what is being done in that larger end. So strategically, that's not where we have elected -- or opted to focus. So we'll continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model. But I don't think you'll see us do something like that. As it relates to the non-U.S. side of the market, the beauty of the U.S. market is it's a relatively singular large market. And there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably China and perhaps India. And those markets have nuances of their own that we won't talk about at this point. So the challenge for us is being nuances in some ways have a larger non-U.S. footprint. But we want that non-U.S. footprint to have the high-quality revenue characteristics that we look for, and those would be sustainable, recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash. So we continue to use those screens and that's always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital, both in and out of the U.S."

So I'm going to take the second one first. So we have ideas on how the rollout will go. I think there's been some discussion publicly about advertising and some marketing around the P2P services for some of the larger institutions. We've seen that going on intermittently but there seems to be a lot of energy around that. And our experience, at least with services such as bill pay is when you think about them to consumers, they tend to want to start using them. So we would expect to see transactions start to grow as their awareness is raised. And perhaps it won't be -- the velocity won't be the same as Venmo. But frankly, we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution. And so we're optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future. We would expect that growth to primarily be -- to come through as payment transaction volumes, some services, helping institutions think about how they're going to be best position their offerings, or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do. There are many, Andrew, institutions who use our technology but they embed it into an experience that's unique to them, and I think we'll see some of that as we move through P2P. So I think it'll come through in a lot of different ways, ultimately be through transactions. And either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients. So it's a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end-to-end processing that we do overall."

And fundamentally, we've known for some time, in order to get sort of a ubiquitous P2P offering really to take off in the United States, you need a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver. You needed -- coming from a trusted financial institution, that's why we have been around this business and kind of pushing this business hard, we think that's a big opportunity. It needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize, and that's been a challenge to break through with a branded market. But very importantly, there's 2 other factors that I think is going to come through for this. One is the ubiquity of it. Being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find endpoints through much of the banking system is really where the promise of, we think, the AWS offering plays. The other aspect of this is that network will be at its inception, a real-time network. And we think that consumer value proposition that comes along with a real-time network and a real-time transaction is that kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives. So for all those reasons, we're again optimistic. We've been optimistic about P2P as a potential game changer for some time and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business."

We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjust",1068,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.
Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjusted operating income margin expanded 10 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. Sales performance was strong in the quarter, attaining more than 100% of quota and was 34% ahead of last year's second quarter. Importantly, that momentum carried over into July, producing one of our -- the best sales months in our history.
Given the strength of our results to date and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.38 to $4.45, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year.
Now let me provide an update on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which as a reminder are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver to innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high-quality revenue growth. As such, our internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was highlighted by 6% growth in our Payments segment. We saw continued strength in our transactional businesses and EMV card distribution. Overall, internal revenue growth in the quarter was compressed by 80 basis points from a combination of lower termination fees, EMV deferral and negative currency impact.
Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points through June 30, in line with our expectations. This was led by strong performance in our Payments segment, which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of 110 and 170 basis points in the quarter and first 6 month of the year, respectively.
As I mentioned, we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a 17% increase in adjusted EPS for the first half of the year. Free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted EPS a bit, up 7% through June, which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of 2016.
We're on -- we're well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. One of our flagship payment technologies is our RXP bill payment solution with over 25 million active users across more than 4,000 financial institutions, including 8 of the top 10 banks. Bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking. And during the quarter, we were pleased to renew our long-standing client relationships with PNC Bank with $350 billion of assets, and SunTrust Bank, with $190 billion in assets.
We've spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our real-time network now through our unique biller relationships. During the quarter, we expanded our network by signing one of the nation's largest wireless providers to process payments on our BillMatrix platform. In early July, we also signed one of the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers through a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its members with more convenient health insurance payment options. Our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the state's public exchange, insurer site, IDR, company agents and a good number of our more than 23,000 walk-in locations across the country. Payment effectiveness requires scale and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition.
Along those lines, you may have seen we inked an agreement with Early Warning, a bank-owned consortium, to enable clients to participate in an emerging P2P network connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the United States together. This furthers our role as a key enabler and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose.
Demand for EMV issuance has remained strong and card personalization volume is growing. As personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured, the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially but remain at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan. That said, we expect EMV card demand to remain healthy for the next several years and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contacts -- contactless card issuance.
Mobiliti ASP users grew by nearly 40% over the prior year's quarter to 4.8 million users and grew 7% sequentially. We also had strong growth in our Mobiliti business solution, with end users growing more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We're still on the very early stages of the digitization of the bank's most important customers. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. During the quarter, Fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation, including inclusion in the InformationWeek elite 100 list of the most innovative users of business technology. We won Best Use of Technology at the payments.com Alexa Awards by connecting our best-in-market Corillian Solution to Amazon Echo for voice-based financial transactions and information at the speed of thought. Westpac Bank, the second largest bank in Australia, with assets of over AUD 830 billion of Westpac Live was ranked #1 in Forrester's 2016 Global Mobile Banking Functionality Benchmark Report in July. Westpac's mobile banking offering is built on our market-leading Corillian solution and is supported by Fiserv.
To further digitize branch banking, we announced Verifast, our state-of-the-art palm authentication solution. This solution, which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint, enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand. This fast, easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity. We see significant deployment opportunities for the back office, teller line and service desks in the roughly 28,000 branches spanning on nearly 5,000 account processing clients in the U.S.
Lastly, 8 new DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 3 with assets over $1 billion, which brings us to 12 implementations for the year-to-date as compared to 11 in the same period last year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include",1016,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results included 80 and 50 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact due to EMV revenue deferrals, reduction in termination fees and FX headwinds. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 6% to $413 million and is up a healthy 7% year-to-date to $812 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 31.9% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, increasing 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, over the prior-year periods. These gains are due primarily to strong Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from our acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08 in the quarter. And for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up a robust 17% to $2.14. Our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted EPS outlook for the year.
At the segment level, our Payments business continued to deliver strong results with internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue, which includes a full quarter's contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 11% in the quarter to $693 million. Performance was led by strong results in card services and Output Solutions including EMV, and solid growth in e-payments.
As Jeff mentioned, while we experienced improved EMV personalization, we still lag manufacturing and as a result, deferred an additional $3 million of revenue in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted revenue is up 10% year-to-date to $1.4 billion.
We further extended existing relationships with our market-leading solutions, including signing 45 debit clients, nearly 60 mobile clients and more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits, and P2P transaction growth was again more than 30%.
Importantly, as Jeff noted, we expanded our base of Mobiliti ASP subscribers by nearly 40% in the quarter to 4.8 million. We continue to believe we're in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day-to-day lives.
Payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent, increasing 14% in the quarter to $238 million, and year-to-date was up 16% to $463 million. Segment adjusted operating margin crossed 34% for the first time, expanding 110 basis points to 34.3%, and was up 170 basis points to 33.9% for the first half of the year. This strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year. Our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well, and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits late this year and into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $613 million in the quarter and $1.2 million in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency, implementation timing and a reduction of specialized regulatory-based services and lower termination fees. 
For the full year, we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year. This is due to -- primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in Q3 of $15 million to $20 million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year, most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses. And while a reduction of termination fee revenue is generally good for the long-term health of the business, it can create comparability issues, as we're seeing this year. That said, we expect to return to more normal termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect stronger Financial segment growth in the second half of the year as we see higher license-related revenue, new client implementations, revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as Notifi and palm authentication and improved termination fee comparison in Q4.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $202 million in the quarter and $397 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter to 33%, but was up 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi.
Corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior year results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year's comparable rate of 34.6%. And while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year, our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about 36% is significantly higher than last year's adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of 2015, which was just over 34%.
Free cash flow was $442 million during the first half of the year, with the timing of working capital, including receivables and tax payments, impacting the first half of the year results which we expect to improve by the end of the year. Free cash flow per share is up 7% to $1.95 for the first 6 months of the year.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of June 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark, repurchasing 2.8 million shares of stock in the quarter for $283 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares at an average cost of $97 per share. And at quarter's end, there were 220.6 million shares outstanding and 11.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn it -- the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sales momentum continue to be very strong in July. We signed several large transactions, which underpin one of our best single months sales performance in our history. Importantly, several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter. At this point, we fully expect to exceed our sales goal for the year.
Integrated sales were $66 million in the quarter, flat to the prior year, and up 38% sequentially, driven primarily by digital and payment solutions. Delivering value to clients through our add-on solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy. Our Operational Effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter, including measurable progress on our data center optimization program. To date, we've combined 7 centers and expect to complete additional locations, including one of our largest in footprint later this year. While we're deriving some benefit from these actions currently, there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years. 
That said, we did capture $17 million of saves in the quarter, and through June 30, we've achieved nearly 70% of our full year operational effectiveness goal of $40 million.
Q2 had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment. We saw many crash in alternative lending as certain highfliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios. And while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies, we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new innovative technology is significant. Our offerings are well-positioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer, which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape. We also witnessed the volatility of Brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world. Although early, we do not anticipate measurable Brexit impact on our non-U.S. business other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue, which is incorporated in our full year outlook.
We remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2016 internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year. Given the lower than anticipated termination fees which, as Bob mentioned, is exacerbated in the third quarter, the increased pressure of FX and the effect of a larger EMV revenue deferral, we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards 5% for the full year. We expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in Q4 compared to Q3 given termination fee comparisons, sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives.
As a result of our strong first half performance, along with anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.38 to $4.45, which is growth of 13% to 15% over the $3.87 in 2015. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, which includes more than 30 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue. And last, we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We exit the first half of the year well-positioned to meet our current financial goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward. As important, we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high-quality internal revenue growth.

And we do expect a bit",631,"Yes, that's a great question, Ramsey. So we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right? We said biasing to 5% for the year. And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new live clients, as we've been talking about for the last several years. So that points to the majority of the focus on the financial segment. And our calculus, and we've looked at this a variety of different ways, primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year than we have historically seen, and it really comes down to a couple of factors, and let me lay them out. The first one is we've had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares. So we had some regulatory, and we talked about in the first quarter some license-related revenue that was lumpy in our '15 numbers. And we've had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year. And so we see that easing on both fronts. And therefore, we're already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue. And we would expect, as that lumpiness in the prior year went away, that we'll get some comparable benefit. The second item, and this is one of the larger ones, is just this -- the continuing growth in our transactional services. Now some of these are certainly on the payments side, lending -- I'm sorry, Mobiliti, EMV, as we were talking about the reduction of the deferral but we've also seen very good growth in our lending businesses. Our largest account processing client went live late in Q2, so all of those, we believe, will provide benefit. The next item is you'll remember back to last year, we had a pretty slow sales year really until Q4, and it was actually primarily in December. Actually, December of 2015 was, by far, our largest sales month in history. And as you know, most of our implementations run 6, 9, 12 months or more, so the revenue that we signed last December, it's starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the Financial segment, so we're excited about that. And then, lastly, on the sales front, we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year are -- have either unusually short implementation cycle or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we sign them. So in fact, we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in Q4. All of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to. And then, lastly, just the compound effect again of our -- some of our innovation-based initiatives, programs like our integrated payment strategy, Notifi, Agiliti and the like. So we've got a long laundry list knowing that this would be an important point. We've got it -- we've got them recorded and we've got our management teams focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year. But again, the -- I think, very importantly, is these growth engines are not one and done engines. These are engines that we'll sustain. It will give us, we think, very good -- a very good tailwind entering into '16. And then, when you combine that with the very good sale -- I mean, into '17, I'm sorry. When you combine that with the very good sales performance that we're seeing this year and we expect to see this year, we're pretty bullish on how '17 is starting to stack up."

The way to think about EMV, some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue but that has declined pretty precipitously over the last 4 quarters, down to only about $3 million this quarter, so not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint. And that receivables collection is really a timing, and in fact, we started to see that collection turn already in July.

Obviously, it's kind of a mixed bag, right? On one hand, it's always better to not have termination fee revenue. On the other hand, termination fee revenue tends to have fairly high margins, as you note. You've probably heard in our prepared remarks that we're doing quite a nice job on our Operational Effectiveness program. We're already at about 70% of our full year target. And the beauty of that is that's real economic benefit that -- the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees. So there is some benefit there. And frankly, as you know well, if you look at the sources of our growth being in the Payments segment, the Payments segment, I think, we mentioned in our remarks crossed over 34% for the first time ever. I mean, those -- that -- the mix of the revenue is actually working quite favorably for us this year and we're not pulling any levers beyond the normal levers that we always pull. It just so happens that in some of the products, take Mobiliti that we invested in several years ago, once you cross the line on that, the contributions are pretty attractive."

We've been farming that space for a couple of years. We mentioned we signed one of the largest wireless companies in the U.S., again, to use one of our payment acceptance platforms. And that, we talked about a lot, is an important differentiator in our now strategy. So the ability to route payments, not just through issuers but being able to have issuers, consumers and billers using the same real-time ecosystem, you may have seen that we signed an arrangement with AWS, so again, building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability. So on the non-issuer side, that's working out quite well. On the issuer side, we're continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience. So mobile, online -- online is getting an interesting wave of at least refreshed lookie loos saying, ""Hey, I've got this really great mobile experience. What do I do with online?"" And then, some of our payments capabilities that are -- whether it's our IPS set of capabilities, account transfer, bill payment, which is still kind of, as I mentioned, the killer app of non-point-of-sale payments. Those are all the areas which we're getting focus and having good interest. And frankly, that's why our sales are good, but importantly, our pipeline continues to grow pretty precipitously."

Like many other service offerings, some banks will create -- some institutions will create their own P2P offering and some will use parts of ours or parts of someone else's and -- but many of them, we believe, will use all of ours. We've got roughly 2,400 institutions today in the U.S. that are using our Popmoney technology. And as Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're off to a pretty solid cadence of a 30% transactional growth. Every quarter, we're announcing year-over-year growth kind of in that range. It is our belief that there are roughly 100 person-to-person payments per household per year. So 100 times 110 million households roughly in the U.S. that have an opportunity to be digitized, electronified and moved in a different way. And whether that is -- ends up being 5% or 10% or 50%, none of us really know, but we believe that our technology is central to having that happen. So ultimately, we think we'll drive transaction volume. We think there'll be network gateways, there'll be risk products. There'll be all kinds of different pieces of that value chain. And we've been in this for a while. We've got a nice footprint. Some clients will probably link to Early Warning but what we do know is with the 5,000 institutions that we provide core account processing for today, we think, will play an important role in serving them. And the 4,000 institutions that use our bill payment solution, including 8 of the top 10 banks in the U.S., will continue to operate with us.

So I assume that on the competitive question, you were talking about talking about the guys who bought SunGard. And we don't really compete very much against the SunGard assets and it's -- that is not strategically aligned with where we're focused in the market. So frankly, we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that. And I don't see a lot of parallel between, for example, what's going on in the P2P space with the Early Warning announcement and our over 2,000 institutions using Popmoney and what is being done in that larger end. So strategically, that's not where we've elected or opted to focus. So we'll continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model, but I don't think you'll see us do something like that. As it relates to the non-U.S. side of the market, the beauty of the U.S. market is it's a relatively singular large market. And there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably China and perhaps India. And those markets have nuances of their own that we won't talk about at this point. So the challenge for us is being -- we'd like to -- in some ways, have a larger non-U.S. footprint, but we want that non-U.S. footprint to have the high-quality revenue characteristics that we look for, and those would be sustainable recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash. So we continue to use those screens and that's always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital, both in and out of the U.S."

But frankly, we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution. And so we're optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future. We would expect that growth to primarily be -- to come through as payment transaction volumes, some services, helping institutions think about how they're going to best position their offerings, or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do. There are many, Andrew, institutions who use our bill pay technology but they embed it into an experience that's unique to them, and I think, we'll see some of that as we move through P2P. So I think, it'll come through in a lot of different ways, ultimately be through transactions, and either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients, so a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end-to-end processing that we do overall."

And fundamentally, we've known for some time that in order to get sort of a ubiquitous P2P offering really to take off in the United States, you needed a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver. You needed -- coming from a trusted financial institution, that's why we have been around this business and kind of pushing this business so hard, we think that's a big opportunity. It needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize, and that's been a challenge to break through with a brand in the market. But very importantly, there's 2 other factors that I think is going to come through with this. One is the ubiquity of it. Being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find endpoints through much of the banking system is really where the promise of, we think, the EWS offering plays. The other aspect of this is that network will be, at its inception, a real-time network. And we think that the consumer value proposition that comes along with a real-time network and a real-time transaction is the kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives. So for all those reasons, we're again optimistic. We've been optimistic about P2P as a potential game-changer for some time and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business."

It's a growing -- a rapidly growing piece of the business. The growth contributions are important. And we are -- I would actually venture to say we are even earlier in our mobile journey and our online transformation journey than we are in our EMV journey. And that is -- we have significant growth runway to go. Most of the pundits believe that we'll see, over the next 3 to 5 years, 70% to 80% of the -- of banking users be mobile, and that number for us is well, well, well south of that. So we feel quite good about that. And again, I would not underestimate the importance of remodeling the digital experience for online as well. So both of those, we think, are important. And then, we did do the little -- the ACI, the Community Financial Services acquisition early on. We're just starting to move those client institutions and ultimately, their customers into the mix.

We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjust",1067,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.
Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjusted operating income margin expanded 10 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. Sales performance was strong in the quarter, attaining more than 100% of quota and was 34% ahead of last year's second quarter. Importantly, that momentum carried over into July, producing one of our -- the best sales months in our history.
Given the strength of our results to date and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.38 to $4.45, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year.
Now let me provide an update on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which as a reminder are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high-quality revenue growth. As such, our internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was highlighted by 6% growth in our Payments segment. We saw continued strength in our transactional businesses and EMV card distribution. Overall, internal revenue growth in the quarter was compressed by 80 basis points from a combination of lower termination fees, EMV deferral and negative currency impact.
Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points through June 30, in line with our expectations. This was led by strong performance in our Payments segment, which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of 110 and 170 basis points in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, respectively.
As I mentioned, we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a 17% increase in adjusted EPS for the first half of the year. Free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted EPS a bit, up 7% through June, which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of 2016.
We're on -- we're well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. One of our flagship payment technologies is our RXP bill payment solution with over 25 million active users across more than 4,000 financial institutions, including 8 of the top 10 banks. Bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking. And during the quarter, we were pleased to renew our long-standing client relationships with PNC Bank with $350 billion of assets, and SunTrust Bank, with $190 billion in assets.
We've spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our real-time network now through our unique biller relationships. During the quarter, we expanded our network by signing one of the nation's largest wireless providers to process payments on our BillMatrix platform. In early July, we also signed one of the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers through a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its members with more convenient health insurance payment options. Our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the state's public exchange, insurer site, IDR, company agents and a good number of our more than 23,000 walk-in locations across the country. Payment effectiveness requires scale and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition.
Along those lines, you may have seen we inked an agreement with Early Warning, a bank-owned consortium, to enable clients to participate in an emerging P2P network connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the United States together. This furthers our role as a key enabler and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose.
Demand for EMV issuance has remained strong and card personalization volume is growing. As personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured, the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially but remain at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan. That said, we expect EMV card demand to remain healthy for the next several years and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contacts -- contactless card issuance.
Mobiliti ASP users grew by nearly 40% over the prior year's quarter to 4.8 million users and grew 7% sequentially. We also had strong growth in our Mobiliti business solution, with end users growing more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We're still on the very early stages of the digitization of the bank's most important customers. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. During the quarter, Fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation, including inclusion in the InformationWeek elite 100 list of the most innovative users of business technology. We won Best Use of Technology at the payments.com Alexa Awards by connecting our best-in-market Corillian Solution to Amazon Echo for voice-based financial transactions and information at the speed of thought. Westpac Bank, the second largest bank in Australia, with assets of over AUD 830 billion of Westpac Live was ranked #1 in Forrester's 2016 Global Mobile Banking Functionality Benchmark Report in July. Westpac's mobile banking offering is built on our market-leading Corillian solution and is supported by Fiserv.
To further digitize branch banking, we announced Verifast, our state-of-the-art palm authentication solution. This solution, which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint, enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand. This fast, easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity. We see significant deployment opportunities for the back office, teller line and service desks in the roughly 28,000 branches spanning our nearly 5,000 account processing clients in the U.S.
Lastly, 8 new DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 3 with assets over $1 billion, which brings us to 12 implementations for the year-to-date as compared to 11 in the same period last year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,372081028,1022464,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results include",1016,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results included 80 and 50 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact due to EMV revenue deferrals, reduction in termination fees and FX headwinds. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 6% to $413 million and is up a healthy 7% year-to-date to $812 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 31.9% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, increasing 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, over the prior-year periods. These gains are due primarily to strong Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from our acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08 in the quarter. And for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up a robust 17% to $2.14. Our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted EPS outlook for the year.
At the segment level, our Payments business continued to deliver strong results with internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue, which includes a full quarter's contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 11% in the quarter to $693 million. Performance was led by strong results in card services and Output Solutions including EMV, and solid growth in e-payments.
As Jeff mentioned, while we experienced improved EMV personalization, we still lag manufacturing and as a result, deferred an additional $3 million of revenue in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted revenue is up 10% year-to-date to $1.4 billion.
We further extended existing relationships with our market-leading solutions, including signing 45 debit clients, nearly 60 mobile clients and more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits, and P2P transaction growth was again more than 30%.
Importantly, as Jeff noted, we expanded our base of Mobiliti ASP subscribers by nearly 40% in the quarter to 4.8 million. We continue to believe we're in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day-to-day lives.
Payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent, increasing 14% in the quarter to $238 million, and year-to-date was up 16% to $463 million. Segment adjusted operating margin crossed 34% for the first time, expanding 110 basis points to 34.3%, and was up 170 basis points to 33.9% for the first half of the year. This strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year. Our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well, and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits late this year and into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $613 million in the quarter and $1.2 million in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency, implementation timing and a reduction of specialized regulatory-based services and lower termination fees. 
For the full year, we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year. This is due to -- primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in Q3 of $15 million to $20 million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year, most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses. And while a reduction of termination fee revenue is generally good for the long-term health of the business, it can create comparability issues, as we're seeing this year. That said, we expect to return to more normal termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect stronger Financial segment growth in the second half of the year as we see higher license-related revenue, new client implementations, revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as Notifi and palm authentication and improved termination fee comparison in Q4.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $202 million in the quarter and $397 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter to 33%, but was up 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi.
Corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior year results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year's comparable rate of 34.6%. And while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year, our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about 36% is significantly higher than last year's adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of 2015, which was just over 34%.
Free cash flow was $442 million during the first half of the year, with the timing of working capital, including receivables and tax payments, impacting the first half of the year results which we expect to improve by the end of the year. Free cash flow per share is up 7% to $1.95 for the first 6 months of the year.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of June 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark, repurchasing 2.8 million shares of stock in the quarter for $283 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares at an average cost of $97 per share. And at quarter's end, there were 220.6 million shares outstanding and 11.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn it -- the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sale",660,"Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sales momentum continue to be very strong in July. We signed several large transactions, which underpin one of our best single month’s sales performance in our history. Importantly, several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter. At this point, we fully expect to exceed our sales goal for the year.
Integrated sales were $66 million in the quarter, flat to the prior year, and up 38% sequentially, driven primarily by digital and payment solutions. Delivering value to clients through our add-on solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy. Our Operational Effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter, including measurable progress on our Data Center Optimization program. To date, we've combined 7 centers and expect to complete additional locations, including one of our largest in footprint later this year. While we're deriving some benefit from these actions currently, there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years. 
That said, we did capture $17 million of saves in the quarter, and through June 30, we've achieved nearly 70% of our full year operational effectiveness goal of $40 million.
Q2 had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment. We saw many crash in alternative lending as certain highfliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios. And while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies, we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new innovative technology is significant. Our offerings are well-positioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer, which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape. We also witnessed the volatility of Brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world. Although early, we do not anticipate measurable Brexit impact on our non-U.S. business other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue, which is incorporated in our full year outlook.
We remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2016 internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year. Given the lower than anticipated termination fees which, as Bob mentioned, is exacerbated in the third quarter, the increased pressure of FX and the effect of a larger EMV revenue deferral, we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards 5% for the full year. We expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in Q4 compared to Q3 given termination fee comparisons, sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives.
As a result of our strong first half performance, along with anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.38 to $4.45, which is growth of 13% to 15% over the $3.87 in 2015. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, which includes more than 30 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue. And last, we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We exit the first half of the year well-positioned to meet our current financial goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward. As important, we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high-quality internal revenue growth.

And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new live clients, as we've been talking about for the last several years. So that points the majority of the focus on the financial segment. And our out[ph] calculus, and we've looked at this a variety of different ways, primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year than we have historically seen, and it really comes down to a couple of factors, and let me lay them out. The first one is we've had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares. So we had some regulatory, and we talked about in the first quarter some license-related revenue that was lumpy in our '15 numbers. And we've had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year. And so we see that easing on both fronts. And therefore, we're already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue. And we would expect, as that lumpiness in the prior year went away, that we'll get some comparable benefit. The second item, and this is one of the larger ones, is just this -- the continuing growth in our transactional services. Now some of these are certainly on the payments side, lending -- I'm sorry, Mobiliti, EMV, as we were talking about the reduction of the deferral but we've also seen very good growth in our lending businesses. Our largest account processing client went live late in Q2, so all of those, we believe, will provide benefit. The next item is you'll remember back to last year, we had a pretty slow sales year really until Q4, and it was actually primarily in December. Actually, December of 2015 was, by far, our largest sales month in history. And as you know, most of our implementations run 6, 9, 12 months or more, so the revenue that we signed last December, it's starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the Financial segment, so we're excited about that. And then, lastly, on the sales front, we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year are -- have either unusually short implementation cycle or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we sign them. So in fact, we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in Q4. All of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to. And then, lastly, just the compound effect again of our -- some of our innovation-based initiatives, programs like our integrated payment strategy, Notifi, Agiliti and the like. So we've got a long laundry list knowing that this would be an important point. We've got it -- we've got them recorded and we've got our management routines focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year. But again, the -- I think, very importantly, is these growth engines are not one and done engines. These are engines that will sustain. It will give us, we think, very good -- a very good tailwind entering into '16. And then, when you combine that with the very good sale -- I mean, into '17, I'm sorry. When you combine that with the very good sales performance that we're seeing this year and we expect to see this year, we're pretty bullish on how '17 is starting to stack up."

The way to think about EMV, some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue but that has declined pretty precipitously over the last 4 quarters, down to only about $3 million this quarter, so not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint. And that receivables collection is really a timing, and in fact, we started to see that collection turn already in July.

You've probably heard in our prepared remarks that we're doing quite a nice job on our Operational Effectiveness program. We're already at about 70% of our full year target. And the beauty of that is that's real economic benefit that -- the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees. So there is some benefit there.

And that, we talked about a lot, is an important differentiator in our now strategy. So the ability to route payments, not just through issuers but being able to have issuers, consumers and billers using the same real-time ecosystem, you may have seen that we signed an arrangement with EWS, so again, building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability. So on the non-issuer side, that's working out quite well. On the issuer side, we're continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience. So mobile, online -- online is getting an interesting wave of at least refreshed lookie-loos saying, ""Hey, I've got this really great mobile experience. What do I do with online?""

The Early Warning, as you probably know, is kind of really -- has picked up the clearXchange business, and they have been working on this development of a kind of large bank P2P network that their owners can all sign onto. What we announced today is that we will be a technology provider to offer our technology, our P2P technology, which includes lots of different kind of back-end services that would enable any financial institution in the country to participate in that network that EWS is going to be introducing. So in many ways, I think, we're really in the leading position to provide this turnkey technology that financial institutions in general will need. Now some of the larger banks that are --  that are owner-members of EWS have built of their own technology but an awful lot of other financial institutions.

Like many other service offerings, some banks will create -- some institutions will create their own P2P offering and some will use parts of ours or parts of someone else's and -- but many of them, we believe, will use all of ours. We've got roughly 2,400 institutions today in the U.S. that are using our Popmoney technology. And as Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're op to a pretty solid cadence of a 30% transactional growth. Every quarter, we're announcing year-over-year growth kind of in that range. It is our belief that there are roughly 100 person-to-person payments per household per year. So 100 times 110 million households roughly in the U.S. that have an opportunity to be digitized, electronified and moved in a different way. And whether that is -- ends up being 5% or 10% or 50%, none of us really know, but we believe that our technology is central to having that happen. So ultimately, we think we'll drive transaction volume. We think there'll be network gateways, there'll be risk products. There'll be all kinds of different pieces of that value chain. And we've been in this for a while. We've got a nice footprint. Some clients will probably link to Early Warning but what we do know is with the 5,000 institutions that we provide core account processing for today, we think, will play an important role in serving them. And the 4,000 institutions that use our bill payment solution, including 8 of the top 10 banks in the U.S., will continue to operate with us. We think there's ultimately going to be quite an exciting and interesting payment ecosystem beyond point-of-sale that's created."

So I assume that on the competitive question, you were talking about talking about the guys who bought SunGard. And we don't really compete very much against the SunGard assets set and it's -- that is not strategically aligned with where we're focused in the market. So frankly, we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that. And I don't see a lot of parallel between, for example, what's going on in the P2P space with the Early Warning announcement and our over 2,000 institutions using Popmoney and what is being done in that larger end. So strategically, that's not where we've elected or opted to focus. So we'll continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model, but I don't think you'll see us do something like that. As it relates to the non-U.S. side of the market, the beauty of the U.S. market is it's a relatively singular large market. And there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably China and perhaps India. And those markets have nuances of their own that we won't talk about at this point. So the challenge for us is being -- we'd like to -- in some ways, have a larger non-U.S. footprint, but we want that non-U.S. footprint to have the high-quality revenue characteristics that we look for, and those would be sustainable recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash. So we continue to use those screens and that's always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital, both in and out of the U.S."

So I'm going to take the second one first. So we have ideas on how the rollout will go. I think, there's been some discussion publicly about advertising and some marketing around the P2P services for some of the larger institutions. We've seen that going on intermittently but there seems to be a lot of energy around that. And our experience, at least with services such as bill pay is when you think about them to consumers, they tend to want to start using them. So we would expect to see transactions start to grow as awareness is raised. And perhaps it won't be as -- the velocity won't be the same as Venmo. But frankly, we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution. And so we're optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future. We would expect that growth to primarily be -- to come through as payment transaction volumes, some services, helping institutions think about how they're going to best position their offerings, or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do. There are many, Andrew, institutions who use our bill pay technology but they embed it into an experience that's unique to them, and I think, we'll see some of that as we move through P2P. So I think, it'll come through in a lot of different ways, ultimately be through transactions, and either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients, so a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end-to-end processing that we do overall."

And fundamentally, we've known for some time that in order to get sort of a ubiquitous P2P offering really to take off in the United States, you needed a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver. You needed -- it's coming from a trusted financial institution, that's why we have been around this business and kind of pushing this business so hard, we think that's a big opportunity. It needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize, and that's been a challenge to break through with a brand in the market. But very importantly, there's 2 other factors that I think is going to come through with this. One is the ubiquity of it. Being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find endpoints through much of the banking system is really where the promise of, we think, the EWS offering plays. The other aspect of this is that network will be, at its inception, a real-time network. And we think that the consumer value proposition that comes along with a real-time network and a real-time transaction is the kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives. So for all those reasons, we're again optimistic. We've been optimistic about P2P as a potential game-changer for some time and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business."

It seems like it took maybe 6 or 7 months to go from 1 sales peak last December to this July, if I can call this July sort of sales peak. Does that mean that you now have to again replenish for the next 1, 2 quarters in terms of what your sales is going to look like in the second half of the year?"

And it's not as geometric as we had a peak in December and a peak in July because, frankly, we did have a slower year last year. We had a very, very strong year in '14. We spent a good part of '15 replenishing the pipeline but not just replenishing it by adding in clients but really looking at our processes and building what we believe is a more sustainable engine for the future in ensuring that, that pipeline maintains at a higher level. I would actually say that we have more large transactions in our pipeline right now than -- even with our closes in July -- than we had at the same juncture last year. So the values and especially the kind of probability-weighted values are substantially better now than they were a year ago. And given some of the momentum that we're seeing, we would at least be optimistic that we would be in even better shape a year from now."

We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjust",1067,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed the business well in the quarter, delivering solid financial results, strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives.
Internal revenue growth was 4%, adjusted operating income margin expanded 10 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. Sales performance was strong in the quarter, attaining more than 100% of quota and was 34% ahead of last year's second quarter. Importantly, that momentum carried over into July, producing one of our -- the best sales months in our history.
Given the strength of our results to date and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.38 to $4.45, an increase of 13% to 15% over last year.
Now let me provide an update on our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which as a reminder are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high-quality revenue growth. As such, our internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was highlighted by 6% growth in our Payments segment. We saw continued strength in our transactional businesses and EMV card distribution. Overall, internal revenue growth in the quarter was compressed by 80 basis points from a combination of lower termination fees, EMV deferral and negative currency impact.
Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points through June 30, in line with our expectations. This was led by strong performance in our Payments segment, which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of 110 and 170 basis points in the quarter and first 6 months of the year, respectively.
As I mentioned, we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a 17% increase in adjusted EPS for the first half of the year. Free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted EPS a bit, up 7% through June, which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of 2016.
We're on -- we're well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year. Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. One of our flagship payment technologies is our RXP bill payment solution with over 25 million active users across more than 4,000 financial institutions, including 8 of the top 10 banks. Bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking. And during the quarter, we were pleased to renew our long-standing client relationships with PNC Bank with $350 billion of assets, and SunTrust Bank, with $190 billion in assets.
We've spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our real-time network now through our unique biller relationships. During the quarter, we expanded our network by signing one of the nation's largest wireless providers to process payments on our BillMatrix platform. In early July, we also signed one of the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers through a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its members with more convenient health insurance payment options. Our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the state's public exchange, insurer site, IDR, company agents and a good number of our more than 23,000 walk-in locations across the country. Payment effectiveness requires scale and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition.
Along those lines, you may have seen we inked an agreement with Early Warning, a bank-owned consortium, to enable clients to participate in an emerging P2P network connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the United States together. This furthers our role as a key enabler and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose.
Demand for EMV issuance has remained strong and card personalization volume is growing. As personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured, the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially but remain at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan. That said, we expect EMV card demand to remain healthy for the next several years and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contacts -- contactless card issuance.
Mobiliti ASP users grew by nearly 40% over the prior year's quarter to 4.8 million users and grew 7% sequentially. We also had strong growth in our Mobiliti business solution, with end users growing more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We're still on the very early stages of the digitization of the bank's most important customers. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. During the quarter, Fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation, including inclusion in the InformationWeek elite 100 list of the most innovative users of business technology. We won Best Use of Technology at the payments.com Alexa Awards by connecting our best-in-market Corillian Solution to Amazon Echo for voice-based financial transactions and information at the speed of thought. Westpac Bank, the second largest bank in Australia, with assets of over AUD 830 billion of Westpac Live was ranked #1 in Forrester's 2016 Global Mobile Banking Functionality Benchmark Report in July. Westpac's mobile banking offering is built on our market-leading Corillian solution and is supported by Fiserv.
To further digitize branch banking, we announced Verifast, our state-of-the-art palm authentication solution. This solution, which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint, enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand. This fast, easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity. We see significant deployment opportunities for the back office, teller line and service desks in the roughly 28,000 branches spanning our nearly 5,000 account processing clients in the U.S.
Lastly, 8 new DNA clients went live in the quarter, including 3 with assets over $1 billion, which brings us to 12 implementations for the year-to-date as compared to 11 in the same period last year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."
128209,372081028,1022655,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

These results include",1016,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $1.3 billion and increased 5% to $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date. These results included 80 and 50 basis points, respectively, of combined negative impact due to EMV revenue deferrals, reduction in termination fees and FX headwinds. Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 6% to $413 million and is up a healthy 7% year-to-date to $812 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 31.9% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, increasing 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, over the prior-year periods. These gains are due primarily to strong Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from our acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08 in the quarter. And for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up a robust 17% to $2.14. Our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted EPS outlook for the year.
At the segment level, our Payments business continued to deliver strong results with internal revenue growth of 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Adjusted revenue, which includes a full quarter's contribution from our 2 recent acquisitions, grew 11% in the quarter to $693 million. Performance was led by strong results in card services and Output Solutions including EMV, and solid growth in e-payments.
As Jeff mentioned, while we experienced improved EMV personalization, we still lag manufacturing and as a result, deferred an additional $3 million of revenue in the quarter. Payments segment adjusted revenue is up 10% year-to-date to $1.4 billion.
We further extended existing relationships with our market-leading solutions, including signing 45 debit clients, nearly 60 mobile clients and more than 80 bill payment clients in the quarter. Debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits, and P2P transaction growth was again more than 30%.
Importantly, as Jeff noted, we expanded our base of Mobiliti ASP subscribers by nearly 40% in the quarter to 4.8 million. We continue to believe we're in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day-to-day lives.
Payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent, increasing 14% in the quarter to $238 million, and year-to-date was up 16% to $463 million. Segment adjusted operating margin crossed 34% for the first time, expanding 110 basis points to 34.3%, and was up 170 basis points to 33.9% for the first half of the year. This strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year. Our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well, and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits late this year and into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $613 million in the quarter and $1.2 million in the first half of the year. Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 1% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency, implementation timing and a reduction of specialized regulatory-based services and lower termination fees. 
For the full year, we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year. This is due to -- primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in Q3 of $15 million to $20 million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year, most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses. And while a reduction of termination fee revenue is generally good for the long-term health of the business, it can create comparability issues, as we're seeing this year. That said, we expect to return to more normal termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect stronger Financial segment growth in the second half of the year as we see higher license-related revenue, new client implementations, revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as Notifi and palm authentication and improved termination fee comparison in Q4.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $202 million in the quarter and $397 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter to 33%, but was up 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovation-based solutions such as Agiliti and Notifi.
Corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prior year results. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year's comparable rate of 34.6%. And while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year, our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about 36% is significantly higher than last year's adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of 2015, which was just over 34%.
Free cash flow was $442 million during the first half of the year, with the timing of working capital, including receivables and tax payments, impacting the first half of the year results which we expect to improve by the end of the year. Free cash flow per share is up 7% to $1.95 for the first 6 months of the year.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of June 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark, repurchasing 2.8 million shares of stock in the quarter for $283 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased 6.2 million shares at an average cost of $97 per share. And at quarter's end, there were 220.6 million shares outstanding and 11.2 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, let me turn it -- the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota.

As we mentioned upfront, sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in 34% higher than last year's second quarter and 108% of quota. Performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions. Sales momentum continue to be very strong in July. We signed several large transactions, which underpin one of our best single month’s sales performance in our history. Importantly, several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter. At this point, we fully expect to exceed our sales goal for the year.
Integrated sales were $66 million in the quarter, flat to the prior year, and up 38% sequentially, driven primarily by digital and payment solutions. Delivering value to clients through our add-on solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy. Our Operational Effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter, including measurable progress on our Data Center Optimization program. To date, we've combined 7 centers and expect to complete additional locations, including one of our largest in footprint later this year. While we're deriving some benefit from these actions currently, there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years. 
That said, we did capture $17 million of saves in the quarter, and through June 30, we've achieved nearly 70% of our full year operational effectiveness goal of $40 million.
Q2 had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment. We saw many crash in alternative lending as certain highfliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios. And while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies, we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new innovative technology is significant. Our offerings are well-positioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer, which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape. We also witnessed the volatility of Brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world. Although early, we do not anticipate measurable Brexit impact on our non-U.S. business other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue, which is incorporated in our full year outlook.
We remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. We continue to expect 2016 internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year. Given the lower than anticipated termination fees which, as Bob mentioned, is exacerbated in the third quarter, the increased pressure of FX and the effect of a larger EMV revenue deferral, we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards 5% for the full year. We expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in Q4 compared to Q3 given termination fee comparisons, sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives.
As a result of our strong first half performance, along with anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year, we've increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.38 to $4.45, which is growth of 13% to 15% over the $3.87 in 2015. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least 50 basis points for the year, which includes more than 30 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue. And last, we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We exit the first half of the year well-positioned to meet our current financial goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward. As important, we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high-quality internal revenue growth.
Before we go to Q&A, allow me to recognize the more than 22,000 associates who make a difference for our clients through innovation and excellence each and every day. With that, Carrie, let's open the line for questions."

So we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right? We said biasing to 5% for the year. And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit",631,"Yes, that's a great question, Ramsey. So we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook, right? We said biasing to 5% for the year. And the Payments segment has performed quite well all year long. And we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new live clients, as we've been talking about for the last several years. So that points the majority of the focus on the financial segment. And our out[ph] calculus, and we've looked at this a variety of different ways, primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year than we have historically seen, and it really comes down to a couple of factors, and let me lay them out. The first one is we've had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares. So we had some regulatory, and we talked about in the first quarter some license-related revenue that was lumpy in our '15 numbers. And we've had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year. And so we see that easing on both fronts. And therefore, we're already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue. And we would expect, as that lumpiness in the prior year went away, that we'll get some comparable benefit. The second item, and this is one of the larger ones, is just this -- the continuing growth in our transactional services. Now some of these are certainly on the payments side, lending -- I'm sorry, Mobiliti, EMV, as we were talking about the reduction of the deferral but we've also seen very good growth in our lending businesses. Our largest account processing client went live late in Q2, so all of those, we believe, will provide benefit. The next item is you'll remember back to last year, we had a pretty slow sales year really until Q4, and it was actually primarily in December. Actually, December of 2015 was, by far, our largest sales month in history. And as you know, most of our implementations run 6, 9, 12 months or more, so the revenue that we signed last December, it's starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the Financial segment, so we're excited about that. And then, lastly, on the sales front, we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year are -- have either unusually short implementation cycle or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we sign them. So in fact, we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in Q4. All of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to. And then, lastly, just the compound effect again of our -- some of our innovation-based initiatives, programs like our integrated payment strategy, Notifi, Agiliti and the like. So we've got a long laundry list knowing that this would be an important point. We've got it -- we've got them recorded and we've got our management routines focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year. But again, the -- I think, very importantly, is these growth engines are not one and done engines. These are engines that will sustain. It will give us, we think, very good -- a very good tailwind entering into '16. And then, when you combine that with the very good sale -- I mean, into '17, I'm sorry. When you combine that with the very good sales performance that we're seeing this year and we expect to see this year, we're pretty bullish on how '17 is starting to stack up."

You'd mentioned there were a couple of puts and takes in terms of why it was, on an absolute basis, I think, relatively flat versus last year and not growing too fast on a per share basis. Can you visit that? For some reason, I was expecting the EMV revenue deferral to have a somewhat positive impact on cash flow but I might not be getting that correct. Could you go through again just sort of the cash flow dynamics and why you expect them -- what's been weighing on them and why they're going to pick up a little later in the year?"

There really were the 2 key drivers that I talked about from a working capital standpoint in terms of accounts receivable as well as the timing of our tax payments, that's actually the bigger weighting on accounts receivable. And yes, you're right. The way to think about EMV, some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue but that has declined pretty precipitously over the last 4 quarters, down to only about $3 million this quarter, so not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint. And that receivables collection is really a timing, and in fact, we started to see that collection turn already in July.

Obviously, it's kind of a mixed bag, right? On one hand, it's always better to not have termination fee revenue. On the other hand, termination fee revenue tends to have fairly high margins, as you note. You've probably heard in our prepared remarks that we're doing quite a nice job on our Operational Effectiveness program. We're already at about 70% of our full year target. And the beauty of that is that's real economic benefit that -- the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees. So there is some benefit there. And frankly, as you know well, if you look at the sources of our growth being in the Payments segment, the Payments segment, I think, we mentioned in our remarks crossed over 34% for the first time ever. I mean, those -- that -- the mix of the revenue is actually working quite favorably for us this year and we're not pulling any levers beyond the normal levers that we always pull.

So it's using our BillMatrix platform to process payments for a very large -- one of the very large Blues where there's a very interesting dynamics going on in the health insurance, and therefore, the health payments industry, that we're just starting to play in. We've been farming that space for a couple of years. We mentioned we signed one of the largest wireless companies in the U.S., again, to use one of our payment acceptance platforms. And that, we talked about a lot, is an important differentiator in our now strategy. So the ability to route payments, not just through issuers but being able to have issuers, consumers and billers using the same real-time ecosystem, you may have seen that we signed an arrangement with EWS, so again, building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability. So on the non-issuer side, that's working out quite well. On the issuer side, we're continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience. So mobile, online -- online is getting an interesting wave of at least refreshed lookie-loos saying, ""Hey, I've got this really great mobile experience. What do I do with online?"" And then, some of our payments capabilities that are -- whether it's our IPS set of capabilities, account transfer, bill payment, which is still kind of, as I mentioned, the killer app of non-point-of-sale payments. Those are all the areas which we're getting focus and having good interest. And frankly, that's why our sales are good, but importantly, our pipeline continues to grow pretty precipitously."

I mean, the arrangement, we're pretty excited about it. The Early Warning, as you probably know, is kind of really -- has picked up the clearXchange business, and they have been working on this development of a kind of large bank P2P network that their owners can all sign onto. What we announced today is that we will be a technology provider to offer our technology, our P2P technology, which includes lots of different kind of back-end services that would enable any financial institution in the country to participate in that network that EWS is going to be introducing. So in many ways, I think, we're really in the leading position to provide this turnkey technology that financial institutions in general will need. Now some of the larger banks that are --  that are owner-members of EWS have built of their own technology but an awful lot of other financial institutions. And certainly, as you go into the larger number of community institutions still rely on a technology provider like us to give them the back-end systems they need to participate in that kind of a network."

Like many other service offerings, some banks will create -- some institutions will create their own P2P offering and some will use parts of ours or parts of someone else's and -- but many of them, we believe, will use all of ours. We've got roughly 2,400 institutions today in the U.S. that are using our Popmoney technology. And as Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're op to a pretty solid cadence of a 30% transactional growth. Every quarter, we're announcing year-over-year growth kind of in that range. It is our belief that there are roughly 100 person-to-person payments per household per year. So 100 times 110 million households roughly in the U.S. that have an opportunity to be digitized, electronified and moved in a different way. And whether that is -- ends up being 5% or 10% or 50%, none of us really know, but we believe that our technology is central to having that happen. So ultimately, we think we'll drive transaction volume. We think there'll be network gateways, there'll be risk products. There'll be all kinds of different pieces of that value chain. And we've been in this for a while. We've got a nice footprint. Some clients will probably link to Early Warning but what we do know is with the 5,000 institutions that we provide core account processing for today, we think, will play an important role in serving them. And the 4,000 institutions that use our bill payment solution, including 8 of the top 10 banks in the U.S., will continue to operate with us. We think there's ultimately going to be quite an exciting and interesting payment ecosystem beyond point-of-sale that's created."

Let me just follow then on a question that was asked before with your thoughts on what you have in terms of assets. I'm really just trying to understand, A, the competitive environment now, I mean, obviously, one of your biggest competitors has made a very large acquisition focusing on larger financial institutions. Has that led to a change at all in your area of focus around the core, or area of focus around some of the larger banks, some of the ancillary services you may provide some of the larger financials? And then, maybe a follow-on would be just on the M&A side again.

So I assume that on the competitive question, you were talking about talking about the guys who bought SunGard. And we don't really compete very much against the SunGard assets set and it's -- that is not strategically aligned with where we're focused in the market. So frankly, we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that. And I don't see a lot of parallel between, for example, what's going on in the P2P space with the Early Warning announcement and our over 2,000 institutions using Popmoney and what is being done in that larger end. So strategically, that's not where we've elected or opted to focus. So we'll continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model, but I don't think you'll see us do something like that. As it relates to the non-U.S. side of the market, the beauty of the U.S. market is it's a relatively singular large market. And there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably China and perhaps India. And those markets have nuances of their own that we won't talk about at this point. So the challenge for us is being -- we'd like to -- in some ways, have a larger non-U.S. footprint, but we want that non-U.S. footprint to have the high-quality revenue characteristics that we look for, and those would be sustainable recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash. So we continue to use those screens and that's always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital, both in and out of the U.S."

So I'm going to take the second one first. So we have ideas on how the rollout will go. I think, there's been some discussion publicly about advertising and some marketing around the P2P services for some of the larger institutions. We've seen that going on intermittently but there seems to be a lot of energy around that. And our experience, at least with services such as bill pay is when you think about them to consumers, they tend to want to start using them. So we would expect to see transactions start to grow as awareness is raised. And perhaps it won't be as -- the velocity won't be the same as Venmo. But frankly, we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution. And so we're optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future. We would expect that growth to primarily be -- to come through as payment transaction volumes, some services, helping institutions think about how they're going to best position their offerings, or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do. There are many, Andrew, institutions who use our bill pay technology but they embed it into an experience that's unique to them, and I think, we'll see some of that as we move through P2P. So I think, it'll come through in a lot of different ways, ultimately be through transactions, and either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients, so a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end-to-end processing that we do overall."

And fundamentally, we've known for some time that in order to get sort of a ubiquitous P2P offering really to take off in the United States, you needed a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver. You needed -- it's coming from a trusted financial institution, that's why we have been around this business and kind of pushing this business so hard, we think that's a big opportunity. It needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize, and that's been a challenge to break through with a brand in the market. But very importantly, there's 2 other factors that I think is going to come through with this. One is the ubiquity of it. Being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find endpoints through much of the banking system is really where the promise of, we think, the EWS offering plays. The other aspect of this is that network will be, at its inception, a real-time network. And we think that the consumer value proposition that comes along with a real-time network and a real-time transaction is the kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives. So for all those reasons, we're again optimistic. We've been optimistic about P2P as a potential game-changer for some time and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business."

It's a growing -- a rapidly growing piece of the business. The growth contributions are important. And we are -- I would actually venture to say we are even earlier in our mobile journey and our online transformation journey than we are in our EMV journey. And that is -- we have significant growth runway to go. Most of the pundits believe that we'll see, over the next 3 to 5 years, 70% to 80% of the -- of banking users be mobile, and that number for us is well, well, well south of that.

Our third quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, including solid internal revenue growth, strong operating performance and excellent free cash flow, leading to another increase in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. 
As we previewed in our Q2 call, sales results in the quarter were very strong, coming in at 119% of quota, and for the second quarter on a row, 34% ahead of prior year's results. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with adjusted earnings per share up 11% and 15% in each period, respectively. Free cash flow per share through September was up a healthy 20% to $3.32.
Increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second straight quarter reflects our strong operating performance. At the same time, the combination of implementation delays and bringing on new revenue, along with lower termination fees, have us reducing our revenue guidance for the full year. Although we're disappointed in the shortfall, we take comfort knowing that the primary revenue variances are timing related, a combination of signing new business and some product launch delays. We are confident these revenues will come online in 2017, which will contribute to our anticipated internal revenue growth step up next year.
Now let me provide an update on our progress against our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and last, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We remain committed to building high-quality revenue, which is at the core of our internal revenue growth acceleration strategy. Even with this year's revenue delays impacting internal revenue growth, we continue to see significant growth opportunities on the horizon.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year's Q3, which was one of our strongest margin quarters ever, but up 90 basis points sequentially, placing this quarter's results near the top of our best margin performances ever. The combination of high-quality revenue, strong adjusted operating margin and capital allocation discipline produced a 20% increase in free cash flow per share through the first 3 quarters of the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to see product demand across clients and services in areas which enhance digital experiences. 
Along those lines, we signed a $20 billion bank to our CheckFree bill pay solution in the quarter. This midwest institution made the decision to enrich their digital payments experience, resulting in a competitive takeaway for our market-leading bill payment solution.
We were also pleased to welcome 5 new DNA clients during the quarter, which included Farm Credit Services of America. This institution, with $25 billion in assets, was focused on making a long-term decision based on modern technology and enhanced flexibility that could also be tailored to their unique business needs. We're excited about providing technology and services to this new category of specialized institutions.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 34% to nearly 5.2 million users compared to the prior year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the continuing importance of digital engagement between financial institutions and their customers. Mobiliti business also continued its growth, bringing nearly 30 clients live in the quarter and more than 30% sequential user growth.
Earlier this week, the bank consortium, EWS, announced Zelle as the band for its P2P service, which is scheduled to go live in early 2017. Together, we formed a partnership that, on its own, will enable real-time P2P transactions to over 80% of the deposit accounts in the U.S. Today, we support many of the 19 announced bank and credit union partners through Popmoney, and a number of these, including Ally Bank, Bank of the West and BECU, have already committed to access Zelle using our market-leading turnkey solution.
In addition to broadened network reach, clients selecting our offering can benefit from our proven P2P services, such as broadened credit risk management, settlement, reporting, analytics and directory management, many of which may also be utilized by institutions on an a la carte basis. 
We continue to believe strongly that a bank-centric P2P is a long-term winning solution, and with over 2,400 member institutions in our network, we expect to play an important role in spurring growth for this exciting new opportunity.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we mentioned Verifast, our advanced biometric authentication solution. Early interest continues to be strong and we've already signed 25 clients. One of our beta clients, Gesa Credit Union, has received the CUNA award for excellence in technology for their use of Verifast. In addition, Fiserv was recognized as the customer engagement category winner of the IDC Financial Insights FinTech Rankings real results for Gesa's rollout of Verifast as an innovation that creates meaningful and cutting-edge change in the FI space. 
We continue to focus energy on delivering solutions that meet the demands of rising consumer expectations. Along those lines, FCTI signed with Fiserv during the quarter to provide transaction processing for nearly 8,000 ATMs at 7-Eleven stores. In addition to direct card usage, FCTI has also enabled our award-winning CardFree Cash solution, which allows consumers to securely access their money using only a mobile phone. 
We're excited to partner with FCTI to bring value to their customers at the point of thought.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call,",770,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call, Q3's results were negatively impacted by a large reduction in termination fees. This $10 million headwind was a bit lower than anticipated due to some acceleration in termination fees from the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year termination fees to remain below the 2015 level.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $429 million and is up 6% year-to-date to $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.8% in the quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, but was down 30 basis points against the very difficult prior year compare. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 32.2%, primarily related to excellent Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by dilution from acquisitions earlier in the year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.14 in the quarter and is up 15% to $3.28 for the year-to-date. We are well on our way to our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Turning to our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and is 6% year-to-date. Payments segment revenue growth was led by Output Solutions, card services and electronic payments. EMV card personalization was strong in this quarter, leading to a less than $1 million deferral in Q3, continuing the declining deferral trend we experienced over the last several quarters.
Adjusted revenue, which includes results from acquired businesses, was up 9% in the quarter to $701 million and is up 10% year-to-date to $2.1 billion.
Debit transaction growth in the quarter trended up to the low double digits, and P2P transactions grew in the mid-30% range. 
Real-time transaction growth in the quarter was impressive, up more than 100% over the prior year period, led by growth in Popmoney instant transactions.
New client growth in our Payments and Channels businesses has been solid, adding over 100 new debit clients, nearly 260 bill payment clients, and signing over 150 additional Mobiliti ASP clients through the end of September.
Payments segment adjusted operating income growth was exceptional, increasing 12% in the quarter to $242 million and year-to-date is up 14% to $705 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 34.4% in the quarter, which is an all-time high, and up 140 basis points to 34.1% for the first 9 months of the year.
Integration efforts at our acquired payments businesses are progressing well, and we expect more meaningful synergy benefits as we close out the year and roll into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $624 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion during the first 9 months of the year.
Segment internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. But for the reduction in termination fee revenue, Financial segment growth would have been 3% for the quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $209 million in the quarter and is $606 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points sequentially to 33.5% and down 200 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by the low termination fees, which was 120 basis points alone, and the timing of expenses such as incentives, and our quarterly client conference. 
Along those lines, we continue to make meaningful incremental investments in some of our newer innovation solutions such as Agiliti.
Corporate and Other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.8% in the quarter compared to 34.3% of the prior year period. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximately 36%, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year. 
Free cash flow was up 12% to $747 million through September 30 and, importantly, free cash flow per share for that period is up a very strong 20% to $3.32.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of September 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
We remain disciplined in returning capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter, and we've returned more than $930 million in the first 9 months of the year. 
There were 217.8 million shares outstanding as of September 30, and 8.1 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
And with that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales performance was outstanding in the quarter, coming in 34% ahead of last year and 119% of quota. Results were strong across several areas of the company, including card, biller, Output Solutions and bank solutions. Importantly, the results included several large payments-oriented transactions, which are an important driver of future revenue growth. We enter the fourth quarter at 100% of quota -- 101% of quota, a robust pipeline and expect to meaningfully exceed last year's sales results, providing growth momentum entering 2017.
Integrated sales were up 28% to $73 million in the quarter, up 11% sequentially and it increased 12% for the first 9 months of the year. We continue to see strong demand across our digital and payment solutions.
We're experiencing excellent results across our Operational Effectiveness initiatives, having achieved $44 millions of savings through the end of September, already eclipsing our $40 million goal for the full year. We've combined 15 data centers this year, including one of the largest locations, delivering increases in efficiency, enhances our ability to invest in future growth and sustainably expand operating margin.
The environment in the quarter remained generally stable, with clients focused on driving revenue, the evolution of the digital consumer and the need to balance investment with cost controls. 
Real-time money movement remains a key topic, both in the construction of the rail itself as well as the use cases, which will leverage these capabilities such as Zelle. We expect to play an important role in this evolution by providing a number of solutions that will utilize these real-time services. 
Solutions such as NOW, which are designed to enhance ubiquity around these services position us well in the evolving payments landscape.
Turning to guidance, we expect to achieve record operating performance for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow per share for the year. The fact that we can deliver these strong results, even as the timing of revenue and lower termination fees have moderated our in-year internal revenue growth expectations, shows the strength and resilience of our business model. 
We now expect full year internal revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 4.5% which includes higher growth in Q4. We are well positioned for internal revenue growth acceleration as we head into '17.
We have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $4.43 to $4.46, which is $0.11 per share higher on the bottom end of the range than our original guidance or 14% to 15% growth for the full year. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, which includes the margin dilution from the 2 acquisitions completed earlier in the year and lower termination fee revenue. And importantly, we expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We enter the fourth quarter with sales momentum and a platform of solid financial results. We continue to perform within our long-term outlook and are committed to driving a sustainable and steady increase in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years.
During the quarter, we were fortunate to celebrate our 30th year as a public company. Over that period, Fiserv has produced a cumulative return to shareholders of more than 17,000%. This success is a byproduct of the stellar efforts of our more than 22,000 associates and all those who came before to deliver differentiated value to our clients each and every day.

So if we can hold that again, we'll achieve that 50 basis points margin expansion. And if you look at what happened in Q3 relative to what we expect for Q4, there's a number of expenses that impacted us in Q4 of last year that were timing related. And so we saw things like some incentive compensation commissions, our fall forum actually fell into fourth quarter of last year versus third quarter of this year, so pure timing on that standpoint. And so as we enter in the fourth quarter, we've got a little bit of an easier compare, and we're confident we'll deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion on a full year basis."

And we have the ability to moderate those investments on the basis of how we see take-up going in the market.

And so the opportunities -- if our clients want us to be peer with a Venmo or something like that, then we would obviously investigate that. And if that made sense, then we would pursue that.

So I would first say, Chris, that we're not getting guidance, right. We're trying to give a little bit of a calculus to it. I would say number one, it's the implementation of the large transactions that we're talking about that were delayed in '16. Number two, it's really around the new sales. Remember that we had a fairly weak 2015 with a weak Q1. So we really had 5 quarters of weaker-than-expected sales. We had the last 2 quarters were up 34% each and we're expecting to have a reasonably strong Q4. So the cumulative effect of that, we believe, will provide a growth lift to. The third item is really around these new products, where we're talking about the launches and go live. We'll see some aggregate cumulative effect of those products, which are in the market. In many cases, these products are sold already, so we don't have to sell them. We just have to deliver them into the market, so that's the third item. Fourth, I would say is just some continuing success around adoption of some of the products, i.e. Mobiliti. We continue to make progress there, whether it's on the consumer side or on the retail side. And then maybe the last one would be we aren't expecting any meaningful EMV deferral this year. So the turnaround on that will hopefully benefit us as well. So those are 4 or 5 items that I think at least give me confidence that we'll see the step up on top of just the normal transactional growth that we're seeing, whether it's a little bit higher in debit and those kinds of things."

And those are -- tend to be larger transactions. So that has been one of the areas. We've also introduced a couple of new products. We've introduced something like BillMatrix Next, which is on the -- in the Biller side of the business where we've had some fear success this year. Traditionally, we have been focused on the unregistered side of payments. This allows us to have an all-in registered, unregistered, let us handle all of your payments from e-bill all the way to payment acceptance and reconciliation. And this product is getting some nice attention out there. That actually came -- some of those capabilities came from our acquisition of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's convenience pay platform. So that's an example of some of the new products that are out there. And then I would say lastly, it's really -- it has really been about focus. I think we had '13 and '14 were big record year on record year and we probably didn't but just in a focus on that. We've been very focused around making sure that not only are we winning more deals but that they are larger deals. And frankly, Mark Ernst has put a tremendous amount of energy on ensuring not only just winning deals but that the pipeline, the pipelines are strong so we're going to enter '17 with a much stronger pipeline then we had going into the prior year even with a much better sales results.

We know those areas are critically important. We are fortunately, many of the investments that we've been making over the last several years have happened to be in those areas. That, combined with the fact that we have products like CheckFree, which are clearly at the center of digital experience, we're the beneficiary of a little bit of excess demand in those areas. I'm sure there are some areas that we are not seeing the same kind of growth. But they're -- from a sales perspective, they're more than offset by the level of activity we're seeing out here.

We believe that the majority, the substantial majority of the clients that are in the Popmoney network today will continue to access our technology because we have the only full-featured end-to-end, P2P, banks-centric technology in the U.S., the only one.

The substantial majority of the person-to-person transactions that happen in the U.S. today, everything from that used case but paying your babysitter and paying a dog walker and paying a component of rent, I mean, there are many, many used cases that tend to look more like a derivative of bill pay than they do here -- passing $5 or $10 or $20 from person A to person B. That's real estate that the banks tend to own historically. And my conviction is really based on the fact that I believe that ultimately, money movement is something that will need to be done in a safe and secure environment. Then today, the bank-centric system is really the only safe and secure system that exists. And as we move to a real-time rail, I think that will actually become more important.

So when you add all that together, it's clearly important. And in each of the last 2 investor days, we provided statistics on how our top deals turn into revenue. And it shows that there's a -- it can be anywhere from a 12- to 18-month average turn to revenue. So from that perspective, that's not a bad way to look at it.

Thanks, Ashwin, and thanks, everyone for joining us for our third quarter call. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations group. Have a nice evening."

Our third quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, including solid internal revenue growth, strong operating performance and excellent free cash flow, leading to another increase in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. 
As we previewed in our Q2 call, sales results in the quarter were very strong, coming in at 119% of quota, and for the second quarter on a row, 34% ahead of prior year's results. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with adjusted earnings per share up 11% and 15% in each period, respectively. Free cash flow per share through September was up a healthy 20% to $3.32.
Increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second straight quarter reflects our strong operating performance. At the same time, the combination of implementation delays and bringing on new revenue, along with lower termination fees, have us reducing our revenue guidance for the full year. Although we're disappointed in the shortfall, we take comfort knowing that the primary revenue variances are timing related, a combination of signing new business and some product launch delays. We are confident these revenues will come online in 2017, which will contribute to our anticipated internal revenue growth step up next year.
Now let me provide an update on our progress against our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and last, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We remain committed to building high-quality revenue, which is at the core of our internal revenue growth acceleration strategy. Even with this year's revenue delays impacting internal revenue growth, we continue to see significant growth opportunities on the horizon.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year's Q3, which was one of our strongest margin quarters ever, but up 90 basis points sequentially, placing this quarter's results near the top of our best margin performances ever. The combination of high-quality revenue, strong adjusted operating margin and capital allocation discipline produced a 20% increase in free cash flow per share through the first 3 quarters of the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to see product demand across clients and services in areas which enhance digital experiences. 
Along those lines, we signed a $20 billion bank to our CheckFree bill pay solution in the quarter. This Midwestinstitution made the decision to enrich their digital payments experience, resulting in a competitive takeaway for our market-leading bill payment solution.
We were also pleased to welcome 5 new DNA clients during the quarter, which included Farm Credit Services of America. This institution, with $25 billion in assets, was focused on making a long-term decision based on modern technology and enhanced flexibility that could also be tailored to their unique business needs. We're excited about providing technology and services to this new category of specialized institutions.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 34% to nearly 5.2 million users compared to the prior year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the continuing importance of digital engagement between financial institutions and their customers. Mobiliti business also continued its growth, bringing nearly 30 clients live in the quarter and more than 30% sequential user growth.
Earlier this week, the bank consortium, EWS, announced Zelle as the band for its P2P service, which is scheduled to go live in early 2017. Together, we formed a partnership that, on its own, will enable real-time P2P transactions to over 80% of the deposit accounts in the U.S. Today, we support many of the 19 announced bank and credit union partners through Popmoney, and a number of these, including Ally Bank, Bank of the West and BECU, have already committed to access Zelle using our market-leading turnkey solution.
In addition to broadened network reach, clients selecting our offering can benefit from our proven P2P services, such as broadened credit risk management, settlement, reporting, analytics and directory management, many of which may also be utilized by institutions on an a la carte basis. 
We continue to believe strongly that a bank-centric P2P is a long-term winning solution, and with over 2,400 member institutions in our network, we expect to play an important role in spurring growth for this exciting new opportunity.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we mentioned Verifast, our advanced biometric authentication solution. Early interest continues to be strong and we've already signed 25 clients. One of our beta clients, Gesa Credit Union, has received the CUNA award for excellence in technology for their use of Verifast. In addition, Fiserv was recognized as the customer engagement category winner of the IDC Financial Insights FinTech Rankings real results for Gesa's rollout of Verifast as an innovation that creates meaningful and cutting-edge change in the FI space. 
We continue to focus energy on delivering solutions that meet the demands of rising consumer expectations. Along those lines, FCTI signed with Fiserv during the quarter to provide transaction processing for nearly 8,000 ATMs at 7-Eleven stores. In addition to direct card usage, FCTI has also enabled our award-winning CardFree Cash solution, which allows consumers to securely access their money using only a mobile phone. 
We're excited to partner with FCTI to bring value to their customers at the point of thought.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call,",770,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call, Q3's results were negatively impacted by a large reduction in termination fees. This $10 million headwind was a bit lower than anticipated due to some acceleration in termination fees from the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year termination fees to remain below the 2015 level.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $429 million and is up 6% year-to-date to $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.8% in the quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, but was down 30 basis points against the very difficult prior year compare. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 32.2%, primarily related to excellent Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by dilution from acquisitions earlier in the year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.14 in the quarter and is up 15% to $3.28 for the year-to-date. We are well on our way to our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Turning to our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and is 6% year-to-date. Payments segment revenue growth was led by Output Solutions, card services and electronic payments. EMV card personalization was strong in this quarter, leading to a less than $1 million deferral in Q3, continuing the declining deferral trend we experienced over the last several quarters.
Adjusted revenue, which includes results from acquired businesses, was up 9% in the quarter to $701 million and is up 10% year-to-date to $2.1 billion.
Debit transaction growth in the quarter trended up to the low double digits, and P2P transactions grew in the mid-30% range. 
Real-time transaction growth in the quarter was impressive, up more than 100% over the prior year period, led by growth in Popmoney instant transactions.
New client growth in our Payments and Channels businesses has been solid, adding over 100 new debit clients, nearly 260 bill payment clients, and signing over 150 additional Mobiliti ASP clients through the end of September.
Payments segment adjusted operating income growth was exceptional, increasing 12% in the quarter to $242 million and year-to-date is up 14% to $705 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 34.4% in the quarter, which is an all-time high, and up 140 basis points to 34.1% for the first 9 months of the year.
Integration efforts at our acquired payments businesses are progressing well, and we expect more meaningful synergy benefits as we close out the year and roll into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $624 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion during the first 9 months of the year.
Segment internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. But for the reduction in termination fee revenue, Financial segment growth would have been 3% for the quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $209 million in the quarter and is $606 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points sequentially to 33.5% and down 200 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by the low termination fees, which was 120 basis points alone, and the timing of expenses such as incentives, and our quarterly client conference. 
Along those lines, we continue to make meaningful incremental investments in some of our newer innovation solutions such as Agiliti.
Corporate and Other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.8% in the quarter compared to 34.3% of the prior year period. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximately 36%, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year. 
Free cash flow was up 12% to $747 million through September 30 and, importantly, free cash flow per share for that period is up a very strong 20% to $3.32.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of September 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
We remain disciplined in returning capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter, and we've returned more than $930 million in the first 9 months of the year. 
There were 217.8 million shares outstanding as of September 30, and 8.1 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
And with that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales performance was outstanding in the quarter, coming in 34% ahead of last year and 119% of quota. Results were strong across several areas of the company, including card, biller, Output Solutions and bank solutions. Importantly, the results included several large payments-oriented transactions, which are an important driver of future revenue growth. We enter the fourth quarter at 100% of quota -- 101% of quota, a robust pipeline and expect to meaningfully exceed last year's sales results, providing growth momentum entering 2017.
Integrated sales were up 28% to $73 million in the quarter, up 11% sequentially and it increased 12% for the first 9 months of the year. We continue to see strong demand across our digital and payment solutions.
We're experiencing excellent results across our Operational Effectiveness initiatives, having achieved $44 millions of savings through the end of September, already eclipsing our $40 million goal for the full year. We've combined 15 data centers this year, including one of the largest locations, delivering increases in efficiency, enhances our ability to invest in future growth and sustainably expand operating margin.
The environment in the quarter remained generally stable, with clients focused on driving revenue, the evolution of the digital consumer and the need to balance investment with cost controls. 
Real-time money movement remains a key topic, both in the construction of the rail itself as well as the use cases, which will leverage these capabilities such as Zelle. We expect to play an important role in this evolution by providing a number of solutions that will utilize these real-time services. 
Solutions such as NOW, which are designed to enhance ubiquity around these services position us well in the evolving payments landscape.
Turning to guidance, we expect to achieve record operating performance for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow per share for the year. The fact that we can deliver these strong results, even as the timing of revenue and lower termination fees have moderated our in-year internal revenue growth expectations, shows the strength and resilience of our business model. 
We now expect full year internal revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 4.5% which includes higher growth in Q4. We are well positioned for internal revenue growth acceleration as we head into '17.
We have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $4.43 to $4.46, which is $0.11 per share higher on the bottom end of the range than our original guidance or 14% to 15% growth for the full year. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, which includes the margin dilution from the 2 acquisitions completed earlier in the year and lower termination fee revenue. And importantly, we expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We enter the fourth quarter with sales momentum and a platform of solid financial results. We continue to perform within our long-term outlook and are committed to driving a sustainable and steady increase in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years.
During the quarter, we were fortunate to celebrate our 30th year as a public company. Over that period, Fiserv has produced a cumulative return to shareholders of more than 17,000%. This success is a byproduct of the stellar efforts of our more than 22,000 associates and all those who came before to deliver differentiated value to our clients each and every day.

So if we can hold that again, we'll achieve that 50 basis points margin expansion. And if you look at what happened in Q3 relative to what we expect for Q4, there's a number of expenses that impacted us in Q4 of last year that were timing related. And so we saw things like some incentive compensation commissions, our fall forum actually fell into fourth quarter of last year versus third quarter of this year, so pure timing on that standpoint. And so as we enter in the fourth quarter, we've got a little bit of an easier compare, and we're confident we'll deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion on a full year basis."

And we have the ability to moderate those investments on the basis of how we see take-up going in the market.

And so the opportunities -- if our clients want us to be peer with a Venmo or something like that, then we would obviously investigate that. And if that made sense, then we would pursue that.

And David, we, the industry, have been talking about this for a few years. We are seeing that, but one of the areas in which we're seeing it more recently are in the areas of digital experience, where institutions sometimes are finding it difficult to keep up. We have had tremendous interest in our CheckFree RXP solution set this year as banks believe that, that remains the killer app, whether it's accessing online or mobile. And then the services themselves, we're seeing some larger institutions say -- or examine the opportunity to outsource even that where, frankly, 3 or 4 years ago, a large institution outsourcing their digital experience just wouldn't have happened. So we are seeing some interesting movement in those spaces. And frankly, one of the again, byproducts of something like Zelle is it's just pushing the digital capabilities, payments and money movement, making them front and center both on the business and commercial side of the bank."

Plus, of course, it has the benefit of driving the broader bundles of value. But we continue to have fantastic momentum with DNA. And I would be -- the pipeline is pretty strong, and I believe that we'll have a superior DNA sales year next year even to the reasonably strong year we're having this year.

We're making meaningful investments in DNA to ensure that, that platform continues to have a very strong role in the market. So all in all, I would say we're in very good shape there."

I would say, number one, it's the implementation of the large transactions that we were talking about that were delayed in '16. Number two, it's really around the new sales. Remember that we had a fairly weak 2015 with a weak Q1. So we really had 5 quarters of weeks -- weaker-than-we-expected sales. We had -- the last 2 quarters were up 34% each, and we're expecting to have a reasonably strong Q4. So the cumulative effect of that, we believe, will provide a growth lift. The third item is really around these new products, where we're talking about the launches and go lives. We'll see some aggregate cumulative effect of those products which are in the market. In many cases, these products are sold already, so we don't have to sell them. We just have to deliver them into the market. So that's the third item. Fourth, I would say is just some continuing success around adoption of some of the products, i.e. Mobiliti. We continue to make progress there, whether it's on the consumer side or on the retail side. And then maybe the last one would be we aren't expecting any meaningful EMV deferral this year. So the turnaround on that will hopefully benefit us as well. So those are 4 or 5 items that I think at least give me confidence that we'll see the step up on top of just the normal transactional growth that we're seeing, whether it's a little bit higher in debit and those kinds of things."

Specifically, in our digital and payment areas, we've made some changes. We didn't feel like we were moving fast enough in those areas. And again, one of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks, Chris, is that as banks look to really try to differentiate at the point of digital experience, which is currently the handheld device, the mobile device, we're seeing some nice wins and a lot of energy in the digital and payments area. And those are -- tend to be larger transactions. So that has been one of the areas. We also -- we've also introduced a couple of new products. We've introduced something like BillMatrix Next, which is on the -- in the Biller side of the business where we've had some fear success this year. Traditionally, we have been focused on the unregistered side of payments. This allows us to have an all-in registered, unregistered, let us handle all of your payments from e-bill all the way to payment acceptance and reconciliation. And this product is getting some nice attention out there. That actually came -- some of those capabilities came from our acquisition of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay platform. So that's an example of some of the new products that are out there. And then I would say, lastly, it's really -- it has really been about focus. I think we had -- '13 and '14 were big record-year-on-record-year and we probably didn't put just enough focus on that. We've been very focused around making sure that not only are we winning more deals but that they are larger deals. And frankly, Mark Ernst has put a tremendous amount of energy on ensuring, not are we just winning deals, but that the pipeline -- the pipelines are strong. So we're going to enter '17 with a much stronger pipeline than we had going into the prior year even with a much better sales results. So it's a combination of factors but things that we want to -- we believe we've learned from and will benefit us again in '17."

Make no mistake, discretionary spending is not -- is being managed and moderated. There's no question about that. In terms of -- banks are absolutely focused on where they're spending money.

And those areas are tending to be around digital experience, they tend to be around payments, commercial services for banks, and risk and fraud compliance. I mean, those areas are critically important. We are -- fortunately, many of the investments that we've been making over the last several years happened to be in those areas. That, combined with the fact that we have products like CheckFree, which are clearly at the center of digital experience, we're the beneficiary of a little bit of excess demand in those areas. I'm sure there are some areas that we are not seeing the same kind of growth, but they're -- from a sales perspective, they're more than offset by the level of activity we're seeing out here.

Some of those products are licensed add-ons, and some of those products are recurring revenue that takes time to get lined up.

We believe that the majority -- the substantial majority of the clients that are in the Popmoney network today will continue to access our technology because we have the only full-featured end-to-end P2P, bank-centric technology in the U.S., the only one.

And therefore, if you look at all of the use cases that are available to P2P -- I mean, the use cases that we see most often in Venmo are use cases that are around really repaying money or paying money from one person to another, not necessarily for services but for advances and splitting tax and things like that. The substantial majority of the person-to-person transactions that happen in the U.S. today are everything from that use case but paying your babysitter and paying a dog walker and paying a component of rent. I mean, there are many, many use cases that tend to look more like a derivative of bill pay than they do here -- passing $5 or $10 or $20 from person A to person B. That's real estate that the banks tend to own historically. And my conviction is really based on the fact that I believe that ultimately, money movement is something that will need to be done in a safe and secure environment. And today, the bank-centric system is really the only safe and secure system that exists. And as we move to a real-time rail, I think that will actually become more important.

So when you add all that together, it's clearly important. And in each of the last 2 investor days, we've provided statistics on how our top deals turn into revenue.

I would say that there's a difference between the financial institution to their customer monetization versus us as the builder and supplier of the technology and our ability to monetize that technology. But I would tend to agree with you that the P2P monetization is going to be difficult. And I do think disbursements, it could be quite a lucrative potential use case. But I think that's one of the areas we'll probably cover at our Investor Day next year.
Thanks, Ashwin. 
And thanks, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter call. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations group. Have a nice evening."

Our third quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, including solid internal revenue growth, strong operating performance and excellent free cash flow, leading to another increase in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. 
As we previewed in our Q2 call, sales results in the quarter were very strong, coming in at 119% of quota, and for the second quarter on a row, 34% ahead of prior year's results. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with adjusted earnings per share up 11% and 15% in each period, respectively. Free cash flow per share through September was up a healthy 20% to $3.32.
Increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second straight quarter reflects our strong operating performance. At the same time, the combination of implementation delays and bringing on new revenue, along with lower termination fees, have us reducing our revenue guidance for the full year. Although we're disappointed in the shortfall, we take comfort knowing that the primary revenue variances are timing related, a combination of signing new business and some product launch delays. We are confident these revenues will come online in 2017, which will contribute to our anticipated internal revenue growth step-up next year.
Now let me provide an update on our progress against our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and last, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We remain committed to building high-quality revenue, which is at the core of our internal revenue growth acceleration strategy. Even with this year's revenue delays impacting internal revenue growth, we continue to see significant growth opportunities on the horizon.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year's Q3, which was one of our strongest margin quarters ever, but up 90 basis points sequentially, placing this quarter's results near the top of our best margin performances ever. The combination of high-quality revenue, strong adjusted operating margin and capital allocation discipline produced a 20% increase in free cash flow per share through the first 3 quarters of the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to see product demand across financial services in areas which enhance digital experiences. 
Along those lines, we signed a $20 billion bank to our CheckFree bill pay solution in the quarter. This Midwest institution made the decision to enrich their digital payments experience, resulting in a competitive takeaway for our market-leading bill payment solution.
We were also pleased to welcome 5 new DNA clients during the quarter, which included Farm Credit Services of America. This institution, with $25 billion in assets, was focused on making a long-term decision based on modern technology and enhanced flexibility that could also be tailored to their unique business needs. We're excited about providing technology and services to this new category of specialized institutions.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 34% to nearly 5.2 million users compared to the prior year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the continuing importance of digital engagement between financial institutions and their customers. Mobiliti business also continued its growth, bringing nearly 30 clients live in the quarter and more than 30% sequential user growth.
Earlier this week, the bank consortium, EWS, announced Zelle as the brand for its P2P service, which is scheduled to go live in early 2017. Together, we formed a partnership that, on its own, will enable real-time P2P transactions to over 80% of the deposit accounts in the U.S. Today, we support many of the 19 announced bank and credit union partners through Popmoney, and a number of these, including Ally Bank, Bank of the West and BECU, have already committed to access Zelle using our market-leading turnkey solution.
In addition to broad network reach, clients selecting our offering can benefit from our proven P2P services, such as broadened credit risk management, settlement, reporting, analytics and directory management, many of which may also be utilized by institutions on an a la carte basis. 
We continue to believe strongly that a bank-centric P2P is a long-term winning solution, and with over 2,400 member institutions in our network, we expect to play an important role in spurring growth for this exciting new opportunity.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we mentioned Verifast, our advanced biometric authentication solution. Early interest continues to be strong and we've already signed 25 clients. One of our beta clients, Gesa Credit Union, has received the CUNA award for excellence in technology for their use of Verifast. In addition, Fiserv was recognized as the customer engagement category winner of the IDC Financial Insights FinTech Rankings Real Results for Gesa's rollout of Verifast as an innovation that creates meaningful and cutting-edge change in the FI space. 
We continue to focus energy on delivering solutions that meet the demands of rising consumer expectations. Along those lines, FCTI signed with Fiserv during the quarter to provide transaction processing for nearly 8,000 ATMs at 7-Eleven stores. In addition to direct card usage, FCTI has also enabled our award-winning CardFree Cash solution, which allows consumers to securely access their money using only a mobile phone. 
We're excited to partner with FCTI to bring value to their customers at the point of thought.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call,",770,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call, Q3's results were negatively impacted by a large reduction in termination fees. This $10 million headwind was a bit lower than anticipated due to some acceleration in termination fees from the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year termination fees to remain below the 2015 level.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $429 million and is up 6% year-to-date to $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.8% in the quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, but was down 30 basis points against the very difficult prior year compare. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 32.2%, primarily related to excellent Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by dilution from acquisitions earlier in the year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.14 in the quarter and is up 15% to $3.28 for the year-to-date. We are well on our way to our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Turning to our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and is 6% year-to-date. Payments segment revenue growth was led by Output Solutions, card services and electronic payments. EMV card personalization was strong in this quarter, leading to a less than $1 million deferral in Q3, continuing the declining deferral trend we experienced over the last several quarters.
Adjusted revenue, which includes results from acquired businesses, was up 9% in the quarter to $701 million and is up 10% year-to-date to $2.1 billion.
Debit transaction growth in the quarter trended up to the low double digits, and P2P transactions grew in the mid-30% range. 
Real-time transaction growth in the quarter was impressive, up more than 100% over the prior year period, led by growth in Popmoney instant transactions.
New client growth in our Payments and Channels businesses has been solid, adding over 100 new debit clients, nearly 260 bill payment clients, and signing over 150 additional Mobiliti ASP clients through the end of September.
Payments segment adjusted operating income growth was exceptional, increasing 12% in the quarter to $242 million and year-to-date is up 14% to $705 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 34.4% in the quarter, which is an all-time high, and up 140 basis points to 34.1% for the first 9 months of the year.
Integration efforts at our acquired payments businesses are progressing well, and we expect more meaningful synergy benefits as we close out the year and roll into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $624 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion during the first 9 months of the year.
Segment internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. But for the reduction in termination fee revenue, Financial segment growth would have been 3% for the quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $209 million in the quarter and is $606 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points sequentially to 33.5% and down 200 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by the low termination fees, which was 120 basis points alone, and the timing of expenses such as incentives and our quarterly client conference. 
Along those lines, we continue to make meaningful incremental investments in some of our newer innovation solutions such as Agiliti.
Corporate and Other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.8% in the quarter compared to 34.3% in the prior year period. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year. 
Free cash flow was up 12% to $747 million through September 30 and, importantly, free cash flow per share for that period is up a very strong 20% to $3.32.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of September 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
We remain disciplined in returning capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter, and we've returned more than $930 million in the first 9 months of the year. 
There were 217.8 million shares outstanding as of September 30, and 8.1 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
And with that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales performance was outstanding in the quarter, coming in 34% ahead of last year and 119% of quota. Results were strong across several areas of the company, including card, biller, Output Solutions and bank solutions. Importantly, the results included several large payments-oriented transactions, which are an important driver of future revenue growth. We enter the fourth quarter at 100% of quota -- 101% of quota, a robust pipeline, and expect to meaningfully exceed last year's sales results, providing growth momentum entering 2017.
Integrated sales were up 28% to $73 million in the quarter, up 11% sequentially and it increased 12% for the first 9 months of the year. We continue to see strong demand across our digital and payment solutions.
We're experiencing excellent results across our Operational Effectiveness initiatives, having achieved $44 million of savings through the end of September, already eclipsing our $40 million goal for the full year. We've combined 15 data centers this year, including one of the largest locations. Delivering increases in efficiency enhances our ability to invest in future growth and sustainably expand operating margin.
The environment in the quarter remained generally stable, with clients focused on driving revenue, the evolution of the digital consumer and the need to balance investment with cost controls. 
Real-time money movement remains a key topic, both in the construction of the rail itself as well as the use cases which will leverage these capabilities such as Zelle. We expect to play an important role in this evolution by providing a number of solutions that will utilize these real-time services. 
Solutions such as NOW, which are designed to enhance ubiquity around these services, position us well in the evolving payments landscape.
Turning to guidance, we expect to achieve record operating performance for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow per share for the year. The fact that we can deliver these strong results, even as the timing of revenue and lower termination fees have moderated our in-year internal revenue growth expectations, shows the strength and resilience of our business model. 
We now expect full year internal revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 4.5%, which includes higher growth in Q4. We are well positioned for internal revenue growth acceleration as we head into '17.
We have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $4.43 to $4.46, which is $0.11 per share higher on the bottom end of the range than our original guidance or 14% to 15% growth for the full year. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, which includes the margin dilution from the 2 acquisitions completed earlier in the year and lower termination fee revenue. And importantly, we expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We enter the fourth quarter with sales momentum and a platform of solid financial results. We continue to perform within our long-term outlook and are committed to driving a sustainable and steady increase in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years.
During the quarter, we were fortunate to celebrate our 30th year as a public company. Over that period, Fiserv has produced a cumulative return to shareholders of more than 17,000%. This success is a byproduct of the stellar efforts of our more than 22,000 associates and all those who came before to deliver differentiated value to our clients each and every day.

So if we can hold that again, we'll achieve that 50 basis points margin expansion. And if you look at what happened in Q3 relative to what we expect for Q4, there's a number of expenses that impacted us in Q4 of last year that were timing related. And so we saw things like some incentive compensation, commissions, our fall forum actually fell into fourth quarter of last year versus third quarter of this year, so pure timing on that standpoint. And so as we enter in the fourth quarter, we've got a little bit of an easier compare, and we're confident we'll deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion on a full year basis."

And we have the ability to moderate those investments on the basis of how we see take-up going in the market. And so we view this as an important level of flexibility and, frankly, as a driver to the strength and resilience of our operating model."

And so the opportunities -- if our clients want us to peer with a Venmo or something like that, then we would obviously investigate that. And if that made sense, then we would pursue that.

And then the services themselves, we're seeing some larger institutions say -- or examine the opportunity to outsource even that, where, frankly, 3 or 4 years ago, a large institution outsourcing their digital experience just wouldn't have happened.

I would say, number one, it's the implementation of the large transactions that we were talking about that were delayed in '16. Number two, it's really around the new sales. Remember that we had a fairly weak 2015 with a weak Q1. So we really had 5 quarters of weeks -- weaker-than-we-expected sales. We had -- the last 2 quarters were up 34% each, and we're expecting to have a reasonably strong Q4. So the cumulative effect of that, we believe, will provide a growth lift. The third item is really around these new products, where we're talking about the launches and go lives. We'll see some aggregate cumulative effect of those products which are in the market. In many cases, these products are sold already, so we don't have to sell them. We just have to deliver them into the market. So that's the third item. Fourth, I would say is just some continuing success around adoption of some of the products, i.e. Mobiliti. We continue to make progress there, whether it's on the consumer side or on the retail side. And then maybe the last one would be we aren't expecting any meaningful EMV deferral this year. So the turnaround on that will hopefully benefit us as well. So those are 4 or 5 items that I think at least give me confidence that we'll see the step-up on top of just the normal transactional growth that we're seeing, whether it's a little bit higher in debit and those kinds of things."

Specifically, in our digital and payment areas, we've made some changes. We didn't feel like we were moving fast enough in those areas. And again, one of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks, Chris, is that as banks look to really try to differentiate at the point of digital experience, which is currently the handheld device, the mobile device, we're seeing some nice wins and a lot of energy in the digital and payments area. And those are -- tend to be larger transactions. So that has been one of the areas. We also -- we've also introduced a couple of new products. We've introduced something called BillMatrix Next, which is on the -- in the biller side of the business where we've had some fair success this year. Traditionally, we have been focused on the unregistered side of payments. This allows us to have an all-in registered, unregistered, let us handle all of your payments from e-bill all the way to payment acceptance and reconciliation. And this product is getting some nice attention out there. That actually came -- some of those capabilities came from our acquisition of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay platform. So that's an example of some of the new products that are out there. And then I would say, lastly, it's really -- it has really been about focus. I think we had -- '13 and '14 were big record-year-on-record-year and we probably didn't put just enough focus on that. We've been very focused around making sure that not only are we winning more deals but that they are larger deals. And frankly, Mark Ernst has put a tremendous amount of energy on ensuring not are we just winning deals, but that the pipeline -- the pipelines are strong. So we're going to enter '17 with a much stronger pipeline than we had going into the prior year even with a much better sales result. So it's a combination of factors but things that we want to -- we believe we've learned from and will benefit us again in '17."

Make no mistake, discretionary spending is not -- is being managed and moderated. There's no question about that, in terms of banks are absolutely focused on where they're spending money. And frankly, in many cases, banks are slowing spending down in certain areas of the bank and trading it off to be able to invest in the areas that are the most meaningful right now. And those areas are tending to be around digital experience, they tend to be around payments, commercial services for banks, and risk and fraud compliance. I mean, those areas are critically important. We are -- fortunately, many of the investments that we've been making over the last several years happened to be in those areas. That, combined with the fact that we have products like CheckFree, which are clearly at the center of digital experience, we're the beneficiary of a little bit of excess demand in those areas. I'm sure there are some areas that we are not seeing the same kind of growth, but they're -- from a sales perspective, they're more than offset by the level of activity we're seeing out here.

We believe that the majority -- the substantial majority of the clients that are in the Popmoney network today will continue to access our technology because we have the only full-featured end-to-end P2P bank-centric technology in the U.S., the only one.

And therefore, if you look at all of the use cases that are available to P2P -- I mean, the use cases that we see most often in Venmo are use cases that are around really repaying money or paying money from one person to another, not necessarily for services but for advances and splitting checks and things like that. The substantial majority of the person-to-person transactions that happen in the U.S. today are everything from that use case but paying your babysitter and paying a dog walker and paying a component of rent. I mean, there are many, many use cases that tend to look more like a derivative of bill pay than they do here -- passing $5 or $10 or $20 from person A to person B. That's real estate that the banks tend to own historically. And my conviction is really based on the fact that I believe that ultimately, money movement is something that will need to be done in a safe and secure environment. And today, the bank-centric system is really the only safe and secure system that exists. And as we move to a real-time rail, I think that will actually become more important.

So when you add all that together, it's clearly important. And in each of the last 2 Investor Days, we've provided statistics on how our top deals turn into revenue.

If I think of it broadly as normal P2P versus things like disbursements, maybe you could go into payroll, things like that. And the reason I'm making that distinction is because it's not clear to me, regardless of whether something -- whether to please banks and take or not take [ph] -- that you could actually charge for it. But maybe you can charge for disbursements. Do you have, I mean, sort of a prognosis of where we are headed with the types of products that can come out because of having Zelle as sort of a multibank consortium?"

Our third quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, including solid internal revenue growth, strong operating performance and excellent free cash flow, leading to another increase in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. 
As we previewed in our Q2 call, sales results in the quarter were very strong, coming in at 119% of quota, and for the second quarter on a row, 34% ahead of prior year's results. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with adjusted earnings per share up 11% and 15% in each period, respectively. Free cash flow per share through September was up a healthy 20% to $3.32.
Increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the second straight quarter reflects our strong operating performance. At the same time, the combination of implementation delays and bringing on new revenue, along with lower termination fees, have us reducing our revenue guidance for the full year. Although we're disappointed in the shortfall, we take comfort knowing that the primary revenue variances are timing related, a combination of signing new business and some product launch delays. We are confident these revenues will come online in 2017, which will contribute to our anticipated internal revenue growth step-up next year.
Now let me provide an update on our progress against our 3 key shareholder priorities for 2016, which are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and last, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients.
We remain committed to building high-quality revenue, which is at the core of our internal revenue growth acceleration strategy. Even with this year's revenue delays impacting internal revenue growth, we continue to see significant growth opportunities on the horizon.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year's Q3, which was one of our strongest margin quarters ever, but up 90 basis points sequentially, placing this quarter's results near the top of our best margin performances ever. The combination of high-quality revenue, strong adjusted operating margin and capital allocation discipline produced a 20% increase in free cash flow per share through the first 3 quarters of the year.
Our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We continue to see product demand across financial services in areas which enhance digital experiences. 
Along those lines, we signed a $20 billion bank to our CheckFree bill pay solution in the quarter. This Midwest institution made the decision to enrich their digital payments experience, resulting in a competitive takeaway for our market-leading bill payment solution.
We were also pleased to welcome 5 new DNA clients during the quarter, which included Farm Credit Services of America. This institution, with $25 billion in assets, was focused on making a long-term decision based on modern technology and enhanced flexibility that could also be tailored to their unique business needs. We're excited about providing technology and services to this new category of specialized institutions.
Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 34% to nearly 5.2 million users compared to the prior year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the continuing importance of digital engagement between financial institutions and their customers. Mobiliti business also continued its growth, bringing nearly 30 clients live in the quarter and more than 30% sequential user growth.
Earlier this week, the bank consortium, EWS, announced Zelle as the brand for its P2P service, which is scheduled to go live in early 2017. Together, we formed a partnership that, on its own, will enable real-time P2P transactions to over 80% of the deposit accounts in the U.S. Today, we support many of the 19 announced bank and credit union partners through Popmoney, and a number of these, including Ally Bank, Bank of the West and BECU, have already committed to access Zelle using our market-leading turnkey solution.
In addition to broad network reach, clients selecting our offering can benefit from our proven P2P services, such as broadened credit risk management, settlement, reporting, analytics and directory management, many of which may also be utilized by institutions on an a la carte basis. 
We continue to believe strongly that a bank-centric P2P is a long-term winning solution, and with over 2,400 member institutions in our network, we expect to play an important role in spurring growth for this exciting new opportunity.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we mentioned Verifast, our advanced biometric authentication solution. Early interest continues to be strong and we've already signed 25 clients. One of our beta clients, Gesa Credit Union, has received the CUNA award for excellence in technology for their use of Verifast. In addition, Fiserv was recognized as the customer engagement category winner of the IDC Financial Insights FinTech Rankings Real Results for Gesa's rollout of Verifast as an innovation that creates meaningful and cutting-edge change in the FI space. 
We continue to focus energy on delivering solutions that meet the demands of rising consumer expectations. Along those lines, FCTI signed with Fiserv during the quarter to provide transaction processing for nearly 8,000 ATMs at 7-Eleven stores. In addition to direct card usage, FCTI has also enabled our award-winning CardFree Cash solution, which allows consumers to securely access their money using only a mobile phone. 
We're excited to partner with FCTI to bring value to their customers at the point of thought.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results."

Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call,",770,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue increased 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods to $1.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both periods, and as we highlighted on our last call, Q3's results were negatively impacted by a large reduction in termination fees. This $10 million headwind was a bit lower than anticipated due to some acceleration in termination fees from the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year termination fees to remain below the 2015 level.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $429 million and is up 6% year-to-date to $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating margin of 32.8% in the quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, but was down 30 basis points against the very difficult prior year compare. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin has increased 20 basis points to 32.2%, primarily related to excellent Payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives, offset somewhat by dilution from acquisitions earlier in the year.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.14 in the quarter and is up 15% to $3.28 for the year-to-date. We are well on our way to our 31st consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.
Turning to our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and is 6% year-to-date. Payments segment revenue growth was led by Output Solutions, card services and electronic payments. EMV card personalization was strong in this quarter, leading to a less than $1 million deferral in Q3, continuing the declining deferral trend we experienced over the last several quarters.
Adjusted revenue, which includes results from acquired businesses, was up 9% in the quarter to $701 million and is up 10% year-to-date to $2.1 billion.
Debit transaction growth in the quarter trended up to the low double digits, and P2P transactions grew in the mid-30% range. 
Real-time transaction growth in the quarter was impressive, up more than 100% over the prior year period, led by growth in Popmoney instant transactions.
New client growth in our Payments and Channels businesses has been solid, adding over 100 new debit clients, nearly 260 bill payment clients, and signing over 150 additional Mobiliti ASP clients through the end of September.
Payments segment adjusted operating income growth was exceptional, increasing 12% in the quarter to $242 million and year-to-date is up 14% to $705 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 34.4% in the quarter, which is an all-time high, and up 140 basis points to 34.1% for the first 9 months of the year.
Integration efforts at our acquired payments businesses are progressing well, and we expect more meaningful synergy benefits as we close out the year and roll into 2017.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was $624 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion during the first 9 months of the year.
Segment internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. But for the reduction in termination fee revenue, Financial segment growth would have been 3% for the quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Financial segment was $209 million in the quarter and is $606 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points sequentially to 33.5% and down 200 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by the low termination fees, which was 120 basis points alone, and the timing of expenses such as incentives and our quarterly client conference. 
Along those lines, we continue to make meaningful incremental investments in some of our newer innovation solutions such as Agiliti.
Corporate and Other adjusted net operating loss in the quarter was in line with expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.8% in the quarter compared to 34.3% in the prior year period. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of about 35% for the full year. 
Free cash flow was up 12% to $747 million through September 30 and, importantly, free cash flow per share for that period is up a very strong 20% to $3.32.
Total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion as of September 30, or 2.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
We remain disciplined in returning capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter, and we've returned more than $930 million in the first 9 months of the year. 
There were 217.8 million shares outstanding as of September 30, and 8.1 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
And with that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

As we mentioned upfront, sales performance was outstanding in the quarter, coming in 34% ahead of last year and 119% of quota. Results were strong across several areas of the company, including card, biller, Output Solutions and bank solutions. Importantly, the results included several large payments-oriented transactions, which are an important driver of future revenue growth. We enter the fourth quarter at 100% of quota -- 101% of quota, a robust pipeline, and expect to meaningfully exceed last year's sales results, providing growth momentum entering 2017.
Integrated sales were up 28% to $73 million in the quarter, up 11% sequentially and it increased 12% for the first 9 months of the year. We continue to see strong demand across our digital and payment solutions.
We're experiencing excellent results across our Operational Effectiveness initiatives, having achieved $44 million of savings through the end of September, already eclipsing our $40 million goal for the full year. We've combined 15 data centers this year, including one of the largest locations. Delivering increases in efficiency enhances our ability to invest in future growth and sustainably expand operating margin.
The environment in the quarter remained generally stable, with clients focused on driving revenue, the evolution of the digital consumer and the need to balance investment with cost controls. 
Real-time money movement remains a key topic, both in the construction of the rail itself as well as the use cases which will leverage these capabilities such as Zelle. We expect to play an important role in this evolution by providing a number of solutions that will utilize these real-time services. 
Solutions such as NOW, which are designed to enhance ubiquity around these services, position us well in the evolving payments landscape.
Turning to guidance, we expect to achieve record operating performance for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow per share for the year. The fact that we can deliver these strong results, even as the timing of revenue and lower termination fees have moderated our in-year internal revenue growth expectations, shows the strength and resilience of our business model. 
We now expect full year internal revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 4.5%, which includes higher growth in Q4. We are well positioned for internal revenue growth acceleration as we head into '17.
We have increased our adjusted earnings per share outlook to $4.43 to $4.46, which is $0.11 per share higher on the bottom end of the range than our original guidance or 14% to 15% growth for the full year. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, which includes the margin dilution from the 2 acquisitions completed earlier in the year and lower termination fee revenue. And importantly, we expect free cash flow per share to be at least $4.70 for the full year.
We enter the fourth quarter with sales momentum and a platform of solid financial results. We continue to perform within our long-term outlook and are committed to driving a sustainable and steady increase in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years.
During the quarter, we were fortunate to celebrate our 30th year as a public company. Over that period, Fiserv has produced a cumulative return to shareholders of more than 17,000%. This success is a byproduct of the stellar efforts of our more than 22,000 associates and all those who came before to deliver differentiated value to our clients each and every day.

So if we can hold that again, we'll achieve that 50 basis points margin expansion. And if you look at what happened in Q3 relative to what we expect for Q4, there's a number of expenses that impacted us in Q4 of last year that were timing related. And so we saw things like some incentive compensation, commissions, our fall forum actually fell into fourth quarter of last year versus third quarter of this year, so pure timing on that standpoint. And so as we enter in the fourth quarter, we've got a little bit of an easier compare, and we're confident we'll deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion on a full year basis."

And we have the ability to moderate those investments on the basis of how we see take-up going in the market. And so we view this as an important level of flexibility and, frankly, as a driver to the strength and resilience of our operating model."

And so the opportunities -- if our clients want us to peer with a Venmo or something like that, then we would obviously investigate that. And if that made sense, then we would pursue that.

I would say, number one, it's the implementation of the large transactions that we were talking about that were delayed in '16. Number two, it's really around the new sales. Remember that we had a fairly weak 2015 with a weak Q1. So we really had 5 quarters of weeks -- weaker-than-we-expected sales. We had -- the last 2 quarters were up 34% each, and we're expecting to have a reasonably strong Q4. So the cumulative effect of that, we believe, will provide a growth lift. The third item is really around these new products, where we're talking about the launches and go lives. We'll see some aggregate cumulative effect of those products which are in the market. In many cases, these products are sold already, so we don't have to sell them. We just have to deliver them into the market. So that's the third item. Fourth, I would say is just some continuing success around adoption of some of the products, i.e. Mobiliti. We continue to make progress there, whether it's on the consumer side or on the retail side. And then maybe the last one would be we aren't expecting any meaningful EMV deferral this year. So the turnaround on that will hopefully benefit us as well. So those are 4 or 5 items that I think at least give me confidence that we'll see the step-up on top of just the normal transactional growth that we're seeing, whether it's a little bit higher in debit and those kinds of things."

Specifically, in our digital and payment areas, we've made some changes. We didn't feel like we were moving fast enough in those areas. And again, one of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks, Chris, is that as banks look to really try to differentiate at the point of digital experience, which is currently the handheld device, the mobile device, we're seeing some nice wins and a lot of energy in the digital and payments area. And those are -- tend to be larger transactions. So that has been one of the areas. We also -- we've also introduced a couple of new products. We've introduced something called BillMatrix Next, which is on the -- in the biller side of the business where we've had some fair success this year. Traditionally, we have been focused on the unregistered side of payments. This allows us to have an all-in registered, unregistered, let us handle all of your payments from e-bill all the way to payment acceptance and reconciliation. And this product is getting some nice attention out there. That actually came -- some of those capabilities came from our acquisition of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Convenience Pay platform. So that's an example of some of the new products that are out there. And then I would say, lastly, it's really -- it has really been about focus. I think we had -- '13 and '14 were big record-year-on-record-year and we probably didn't put just enough focus on that. We've been very focused around making sure that not only are we winning more deals but that they are larger deals. And frankly, Mark Ernst has put a tremendous amount of energy on ensuring not are we just winning deals, but that the pipeline -- the pipelines are strong. So we're going to enter '17 with a much stronger pipeline than we had going into the prior year even with a much better sales result. So it's a combination of factors but things that we want to -- we believe we've learned from and will benefit us again in '17."

Make no mistake, discretionary spending is not -- is being managed and moderated. There's no question about that, in terms of banks are absolutely focused on where they're spending money. And frankly, in many cases, banks are slowing spending down in certain areas of the bank and trading it off to be able to invest in the areas that are the most meaningful right now. And those areas are tending to be around digital experience, they tend to be around payments, commercial services for banks, and risk and fraud compliance. I mean, those areas are critically important. We are -- fortunately, many of the investments that we've been making over the last several years happened to be in those areas. That, combined with the fact that we have products like CheckFree, which are clearly at the center of digital experience, we're the beneficiary of a little bit of excess demand in those areas. I'm sure there are some areas that we are not seeing the same kind of growth, but they're -- from a sales perspective, they're more than offset by the level of activity we're seeing out here.

And therefore, if you look at all of the use cases that are available to P2P -- I mean, the use cases that we see most often in Venmo are use cases that are around really repaying money or paying money from one person to another, not necessarily for services but for advances and splitting checks and things like that. The substantial majority of the person-to-person transactions that happen in the U.S. today are everything from that use case but paying your babysitter and paying a dog walker and paying a component of rent. I mean, there are many, many use cases that tend to look more like a derivative of bill pay than they do here -- passing $5 or $10 or $20 from person A to person B. That's real estate that the banks tend to own historically. And my conviction is really based on the fact that I believe that ultimately, money movement is something that will need to be done in a safe and secure environment. And today, the bank-centric system is really the only safe and secure system that exists. And as we move to a real-time rail, I think that will actually become more important.

And so we're -- there are many of those metrics that we look at that we're not communicating externally. I would say that it's probably not a coincidence that we had record sales in '12, '13 and '14, and we had an easier growth journey in '13, '14 and '15, where, in '15, sales were not as strong as we liked and we had quite a soft start to this year. So when you add all that together, it's clearly important. And in each of the last 2 Investor Days, we've provided statistics on how our top deals turn into revenue. And it shows that there's a -- it can be anywhere from a 12- to 18-month average turn to revenue. So from that perspective, that's not a bad way to look at it. I would also say that this year, we've had some deals, specifically in the nonfinancial institution space, that we do expect to turn to revenue quicker, which is also going to help us."

If I think of it broadly as normal P2P versus things like disbursements, maybe you could go into payroll, things like that. And the reason I'm making that distinction is because it's not clear to me, regardless of whether something -- whether to please banks and take or not take [ph] -- that you could actually charge for it. But maybe you can charge for disbursements. Do you have, I mean, sort of a prognosis of where we are headed with the types of products that can come out because of having Zelle as sort of a multibank consortium?"

I mean, that's probably a longer question than we can go through here. I would say that there's a difference between the financial institution to their customer monetization versus us as the builder and supplier of the technology and our ability to monetize that technology. But I would tend to agree with you that the P2P monetization is going to be difficult. And I do think disbursements, it could be quite a lucrative potential use case. But I think that's one of the areas we'll probably cover at our Investor Day next year.
Thanks, Ashwin.
