This was another superb and critical year for Southwest, and I am very grateful to all of our people for their hard work. I want to especially thank them for these terrific results. 
Tammy is going to take us through the quarter, but I want to offer up not a comprehensive overview but at least a few highlights. Of course, this was, by far, our best year of earnings in our entire history, and that includes a record return on invested capital of 32.7%. We no doubt benefited from 29% lower economic jet fuel prices. Obviously, that was a major component of our earnings, but so were record load factors and our revenues were up also a very solid 5.6%. 
It was a strategic year for us in that we had secular growth opportunities out of Dallas arising from the repeal of the Wright Amendment, and of course, that has been a phenomenal success. We've also had secular growth opportunities out of Washington Reagan and LaGuardia that is arising from the acquisition of slots. It was also a year that followed the -- at the end of 2014 the completion of the AirTran acquisition and integration. A lot of new markets resulted from that. And then, of course, it was also a year where we had a unique opportunity in which to build an international terminal and launch international flights out of Houston Hobby. That was for the first time since 1969, by the way.
All of that added up to capacity growth of 7.2%, and then of course, we were delighted that traffic was stronger than that, it grew 8.8%. And as a backdrop, the economy for last year was solid. Travel demand was solid, and of course, energy prices moved even lower. So the convergence of all of these things made 2015 a very successful year, but again, one that was also very strategic for us. 
And we accomplished virtually everything that we set out to do. In some cases where we didn't, we at least made significant progress. I'm very happy about that but certainly that includes generating record operating cash flow, strong free cash flow. And we also returned a record $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
So I want to make sure that I highlight 2 announcements from this morning's release. First of all, we announced that we will soon launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. I'm sure you all saw that. And then second, we recently ordered 33 new 737-800s from Boeing, and that is spread out for delivery in '16, '17 and '18. And the sole purpose for that is to accelerate further the retirement of our classic fleet. So mechanically, we did that by exercising 6 options and then on top of that, we placed new orders for 27 more. So you get to 33 more new airplanes. 
And then in addition to that on our fleet chart, you'll also see that we have committed to 2 more used aircraft. But I just want to reiterate that our capacity plans for the next 5 years are essentially unchanged by this announcement. We're replacing the classics with next-generation airplanes. And then, in particular, our capacity plans for 2016 are unchanged, and we still plan to grow this year between 5% and 6%.
So the financial operations and customer service effects of this fleet announcement are all very favorable, and Tammy will take us through all that.
Work continues along 3 basic themes this year as far as investment goes for the future: One, as we have significant airport renovation and infrastructure projects underway across the country, some we're managing, some we're not but big project in LAX, Fort Lauderdale, Chicago, Midway and New Orleans. And that Fort Lauderdale in particular will bring on new capacity for us in 2017. 
Number two, we've got a significant commercial technology program underway. And the headline on that, of course, is the replacement of our reservation system, and that's also targeted for 2017. 
And then finally, we have a major program underway with our operations technology. And the headline on that is the new 737 MAX, along with other very significant technology improvements that Mike Van De Ven has planned. And that has also a 2017 deliverable at least with respect to the MAX. 
So for this year, in addition to our focus on these investment programs, we want to do a handful of things. We want to continue to manage our network growth and mature our developing markets; number two, we want to compete vigorously in an increasingly competitive environment; number three, we want to continue to work on and improve our reliability of our operations. 
Next, we want to continue our focus on the hospitality of our customer service. And through all of this, we want to continue to grow our unit revenues, our margins and our earnings. So there's nothing really fancy about that or 2016, pretty basic blocking and tackling things but clearly, 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for Southwest Airlines.
I just want to highlight for our Southwest people finally that our profit sharing for 2015 will eclipse last year's record and increase by 74% to an all-time record of $620 million. And I'm very pleased about that. I'm very proud of them and their hard work. And I'm very pleased with their being justly rewarded with that. 
So Tammy with that quick overview, I'd love to turn it over to you and have you take us through the quarter"
31726,268188511,919933,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2016",2016-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","All right, thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are very pleased to report a banner year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43rd consecutive year of profits. Our annual earnings, excluding special items, were a record $2.4 billion or $3",2219,"All right, thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are very pleased to report a banner year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43rd consecutive year of profits. Our annual earnings, excluding special items, were a record $2.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted share, which was an increase of 75% year-over-year. 
Our fourth quarter performance was also record-setting, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of profit. Fourth quarter net income, excluding special items, increased 46% year-over-year to $591 million or $0.90 per share, which was in line with consensus. 
Operating income, excluding special items, was a record $992 million, which produced a 5-point improvement in operating margin of 19.9%, which is the best fourth quarter margin performance we've seen since 1978. And it's also worth noting like last quarter, with and without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. 
And the record that really stands out is our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, of 32.7%. I'd like to congratulate all of our outstanding employees on these fantastic results. And like Gary, thrilled we can reward our employees with a record-breaking profit sharing of $620 million for 2015.
Our total operating revenues in fourth quarter were a record $5 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year on a capacity increase of 8.4%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.6 billion. Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in more than 11% growth in traffic and an all-time fourth quarter record high load factor. 
A softer yield environment resulted in a 7% decline in passenger revenue yield and an $8 decrease in our average fare. Our fourth quarter operating revenues included a $125 million net benefit from the amended Chase contract and the required accounting treatment. And this $125 million benefit was about a 2- to 3-point improvement to RASM.
For 2016, we expect to realize a year-over-year incremental benefit from the amended Chase agreement and accounting change. But once we reach third quarter, we will, of course, lapse the year-over-year benefit. For our first quarter 2016, our estimated incremental benefit is approximately $110 million, and that is included in the RASM guidance that we provided. Our developmental markets continued to perform in line with our expectations. And Dallas continues to outperform the system on margins and returns.
International is also developing as planned, including our inaugural service from Houston, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter RASM declined 0.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Considering a 1-point [ph] impact from development markets and roughly 2-point impact from increased gauge and stage, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter record and lastly, industry-leading revenue performance.
Thus far in January, demand for our low fares remains strong. Soft yet stable yields have continued thus far into first quarter. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are estimating first quarter 2016 RASM will be flat year-over-year. In light of the current yield environment, we're very pleased with our first quarter revenue outlook at this juncture.
Our freight and other revenue production was also favorable. In addition to the incremental benefit from the amended Chase card that I mentioned earlier, our ancillary revenue production was strong, led by growth in earlybird and our upgraded boarding revenues. And we currently expect first quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to be comparable with fourth quarter 2015.
I'll turn to our cost performance now. And our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding special items, decreased just under 7% year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control, particularly our fleet modernization effort. Our economic fuel costs decreased almost $200 million year-over-year, and that was driven by the 23% decline in fuel prices. With the current state of the oil market and oversupply situation, we currently expect another year-over-year decline in first quarter and full year 2016 economic fuel costs.
Based on our current hedge portfolio for this year and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price to be approximately $1.70 per gallon. And I'll also provide you our estimates by quarter here. Second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.60 per gallon. And second half, we expect that to be in the $1.80 to $1.95 per gallon range again based on last Friday. And that brings us to a full year 2016 fuel price per gallon in the $1.70 to $1.75 range.
So while above market prices, we're still benefiting from lower fuel prices and currently estimate over $500 million in economic fuel savings this year. Our first quarter 2016 estimated fuel price per gallon is below last year's $2 per gallon and represents the lowest economic fuel price we've realized since third quarter of 2006. 
With respect to our hedge book, our strong profit -- our strong profit margins today call for a more conservative approach to hedging in this environment, in this low fuel environment. We will continue to manage our existing portfolio to minimize costs as we burn off our 2016 and 2017 positions. Prospectively, we'll focus on catastrophic protection with no downside risk, particularly in this environment. For 2018, as we reported, we are 35% hedged and that's with all calls and call spreads. So while our hedging philosophy has not changed, our tactics have in this environment. And we will manage through our portfolio and this fourth quarter of 2015, we participated in 85% of the market decline.
So I'll take you through our nonfuel costs quickly. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were flat, including a 36% year-over-year increase in profit sharing that our employees earned for fourth quarter 2015. Profit sharing expense accrued in the fourth quarter was $136 million. And that brings again the total for the year to an astounding $620 million, which again was 75% year-over-year. 
Excluding profit sharing and special items, our nonfuel unit costs decreased 1.1% year-over-year, which was towards the more favorable end of our cost guidance due primarily to reduction in advertise spend and lower airport costs than we had expected. 
Our fleet modernization produced the expected $700 million in EBIT this year, and that's even with the drop in fuel prices. So based on our current cost trends, we expect first quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And keep in mind that roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation, which, of course, is a noncash charge from our recent decision to accelerate the retirement of the classic fleet that Gary took you through.
For our full year 2016, we are currently estimating a 1% year-over-year increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And again, this modest cost inflation is almost entirely driven by the accelerated depreciation. And as a quick reminder, as we noted in our press release this morning, this cost guidance only reflects current labor contracts. Therefore, it does not include the impact from the tentative agreement currently out for vote with our ramp operations provisioning and cargo vote.
I'll move to our balance sheet and cash flow. And of course, our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, and that's after [indiscernible] being $835 million in cash collateral to third parties. We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2015 and incurred $2 billion in capital expenditures. For 2016, we continue to estimate CapEx of approximately $2 billion, and I'll cover our aircraft CapEx when I review our fleet plans here shortly.
We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015, which exceeded our free cash flow of $1.1 billion. And we will have $200 million remaining on the $1.5 billion purchase program as we launch our $500 million accelerated share repurchase, which we will be doing soon. We repaid $213 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2015 and issued $500 million senior unsecured notes at an all-time low 2.65%. And this was in light of our debt maturities of approximately $600 million here in 2016. 
Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range. And of course, we are very proud of our strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating that was further strengthened during fourth quarter with an upgrade by Fitch to BBB+. And that followed an upgrade in July by Moody's to Baa1. We're focused on preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows while continuing our long-standing track of returning significant value to our shareholders.
I'll move now to our fleet and capacity plans. We ended 2015 with 704 aircraft in our fleet as planned and outlined in this morning's release. Our press release also included our future delivery schedule that I'd point you to that we restructured at the end of December in conjunction with our decision to further accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet. 
I'll quickly take you through the revisions, but they included the conversion of our remaining 25 next-gen -700 firm orders to next-gen -800 firm orders. And it included the addition, as Gary mentioned, of 33 -800 firm deliveries. And as he noted, some of those were options that we had exercised. And we had 2 additional used -700s. We now intend to retire a classic fleet no later than mid-2018, and that's compared to our previous plan that had retirements gearing into 2021. And we had 129 classic aircraft in our fleet at year-end.
Roughly 2/3 of our classic aircraft were impacted by our decision to further accelerate the retirement. The incremental and aircraft in our restructured order book is intended to backfill these aircraft while maintaining our current plans to keep our year-over-year fleet growth over the next 3 years to no more than 2% on average.
The accelerated retirement plan is estimated to produce cumulative EBIT improvement of approximately $200 million over the acceleration period, and that's primarily through maintenance and fuel cost savings. And I'd also note that this incorporates the approximate $100 million in accelerated depreciation that I referred to earlier. 
And the overall customer experience will improve as well with the fully WiFi-equipped more modernized fleet. Our future from capital commitments increased approximately $400 million as a result of the order book revisions. And our 2015 capital expenditures increased $200 million to $300 million, and that was primarily related or that was related to a restructuring of our order book. 
Our aircraft CapEx for 2016 is still estimated to fall in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. And our average aircraft CapEx for 2017 and 2018 combined is currently estimated to be in a similar range as 2016, which is very manageable.
While the details of our agreement are confidential, the economics of our order book are very supportive of our continued fleet modernization efforts. Overall, the internal rate of return on accelerating retirement of our classic fleet is estimated to exceed our return of investment and this is after-tax, which we reported here in 2015 of almost 21%. So it was a very easy decision for us. We are still optimizing our retirement schedule over the next few years but we expect to end 2016 with roughly 720 aircraft.
With regards to capacity, we ended 2015 as planned and we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. And as we previously noted, the majority of 2016 capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of our 2015 expansion.
So in conclusion, we ended an exceptionally strong 2015 with a record fourth quarter. And our outlook for first quarter calls for another quarter of strong operating margins approaching 20%. Despite a soft yield environment, demand held strong producing a record revenue. We currently estimate our first quarter RASM will be flat year-over-year based on revenue and booking trends thus far in 2016, which suggests a continuation of the strong demand, soft yield environment. 
Substantially lower fuel prices and other cost controls contributed to our favorable cost performance in 2015. And our outlook for 2016 calls for modest cost inflation, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And again, that was driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and an EBIT improvement in the $200 million range. We continue to benefit from lower fuel prices and currently estimate this year's fuel costs to be more than $500 million lower year-over-year based on last Friday's prices and including our current fuel hedge.
Our balance sheet is industry-leading and our cash flows remain strong. And as ever, we are committed to creating value, and we are very pleased that we were able to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015. 
And as we announced this morning, we will be launching our $500 million accelerated share repurchase soon, which will leave $200 million remaining on our outstanding $1.5 billion buyback authorization. And again, our pretax return on invested capital was an astounding 32.7%. I would like to close by thanking all of our employees for their outstanding contribution to these very strong results.
So with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions."

Not -- there's never been a promise to be the highest-paying airline in the industry. And so to the extent that we're able to do that because we produce great results, I think that is terrific. But all of that needs to obviously be negotiated with our labor groups, and that's what happens and that's the way that works.

And I -- first of all, I think that it is inevitable that over time, that an industry will get more competitive, especially when there's a disruptor as there has been with Southwest Airlines. So it is not shocking at all that we have more intense competition today than at any time in our history. And it is a challenge for our company and something that I'm very confident that our people will rise up to that challenge. But indeed, it will put an obligation on us to continue to innovate and work very, very hard so that we don't lose our low-fare leadership position in the country. So absolutely, it is different, and I think we recognize that the industry is more competitive today than it has been ever. I would quickly add, by the way, that Southwest has never been stronger. We've never had the route network. We've never had the depth and breadth of the service that we offer. And we've never had a balance sheet this strong. We've never had earnings this strong.

Obviously, we reported a lot on Dallas Love Field and are very pleased with how those markets are progressing. But we wouldn't expect our international markets, as an example, to mature as a right we would say at Dallas or even the AirTran market. So they're all a little bit different, but I can at least help quantify the impact we're expecting here in the first quarter. And if you -- it's probably in terms of -- it's probably a 1-point, I'll call it, maybe not even a 1-point impact from development markets. So as we move into 2016, at least my expectation would be that we'll get some tailwinds from our development markets as those continue to mature."

The -- I would admit to you all that it is -- the year is off to a very concerning start when it comes to headlines around the world. It's almost as if we're living in a different dimension here at Southwest and from what I've heard from some of our competitor reports too. So our business continues to be strong, but I will quickly admit that there are concerning headlines around the world. So you translate this to oil prices and living in Texas my entire life, this is an oil and gas state. And yes, it is concerning the impact that it will have on companies and debt payments and jobs and so on. There's no question that the United States has benefited from the oil and gas boom that was occurring over the last x number of years since the -- really since the recession. So yes, that's all a concern that no doubt you have, we share that. But at least in terms of seeing any manifestation of that in our business, we just -- we don't see it. Even our oil and gas markets, if you want to call them that, produced very strong results in the fourth quarter. Several of our markets have year-over-year yield pressure, if you will, so that's not unique to those markets, but they still produced very, very handsome returns. But yes, it's just something we're going to have to keep our eye on. And I offer that background just as an acknowledgment that we're just living in a world where we need to continue to be alert and be cautious. I will then follow on and say that we felt like our plan for 2015 was sound and it turned out to be so. We think that the follow-on plan here for 2016 is also sound. It is more conservative than what we had committed ourselves to for last year. And as Tammy and I have both reiterated, we've not made any change with our capacity outlook and especially for 2016. We're still right in the 5% to 6% range. And I think all of us would be prepared that if, for whatever reason, travel demand weakens, then we would be -- we would want to address that and then at least discuss what kind of options we have to react on the downside. But in terms of taking advantage -- further advantage of low energy prices and boosting our capacity, we don't have any plans to do that. So Tammy, before we go on to the second question, anything you would like to add?"

I guess, I'll just point back to our fleet modernization efforts that when we set our plan, I guess I just have to say we've been very pleased with the benefits from our fleet modernizations so far. And as we continued to evaluate just the operating cost of operating classic as the windows and size we just really took out our pencils, evaluated it and we were able to come up with a plan that actually is going to enable us to improve our EBIT with very -- at very modest capital levels. So I think you know Southwest well. We prefer a simplified fleet. And even the classics fleet of 737, we'd much prefer to operate 700s and 800s, and it certainly simplifies a lot of the operations and also just improves the reliability in terms of just less downtime from a maintenance perspective. So I think we'll get -- also get a boost from the productivity of our fleet, which certainly was part of the EBIT contribution that we're expecting. So all in all, when we sat down and evaluated it, it became pretty compelling to go ahead and accelerate the classics. So hopefully, that helps provide a little color as to what went into the decision-making process. Gary, did you have anything?"

And I think it's back to that convergence or confluence of things. First of all, we're at a fleet number that is manageable to think about accelerating retirement in that way. We have more out-of-service time with those airplanes for maintenance reasons than we do the rest of our fleet. So -- and Tammy made that point I just want to reiterate. You'll get a lot more productivity out of a new airplane than what we are currently getting out of these classics, which means you don't necessarily even have to have a tail-by-tail replacement, although that is our plan. But they'll be more efficient. The other thing is that Boeing was available to us. Boeing had delivery positions. And we were able to strike a deal with them in a way that was -- that worked for them and was a win for them, it was a win for us. So that was key. With respect to our people, I think about the people after touch the airplane, the pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, especially. It's just far easier for our people to operate the next-gen than it is the classics. That's just a fact. So this will simplify a lot of things for all 3 of those workgroups, and in particular, our pilots. So it's a good deal. It works out -- it'd be better for our customers. And all the way around, we're just delighted that we have this alternative available, and we were able to pull it all together at the end of the year. But it was an idea and a decision that was aggressively pursued in 2015, in fact, the latter part of 2015 and fortunately, it all came together."

All-in, I want Southwest Airlines to be lowest price. We'll win if we have the best service at the lowest price. And that's been our tradition. That's been our history. That's what the whole company is based upon. And that's what our growth plans are fundamentally based upon. I think it is a slippery slope to accept that our cost and our fares can be higher based on service, because as you well know, there's a long list of failures in the airline industry who pursue that exact strategic plan. And it's really a cop-out. It's really not facing up to the challenges of finding more and better ways to compete on cost and on price. So the thing I love about Southwest is it's been a company who's been able to do both. And the other thing that you find, I think, is, which is a slippery slope is companies can change.

But the other thing that's going on is you look at the broader GDP results for the fourth quarter, and they weren't very good. So it's possible that the industry was seeing some softening in demand that led to more aggressive discounting. And it's, coupled with the industry also growing faster than GDP. So it wouldn't be shocking to find that there was a little bit of a rough patch there and just trying to get supply and demand cleared. If [indiscernible] by price.

This was another superb and critical year for Southwest, and I am very grateful to all of our people for their hard work. I want to especially thank them for these terrific results. 
Tammy is going to take us through the quarter, but I want to offer up not a comprehensive overview, but at least a few highlights. Of course, this was, by far, our best year of earnings in our entire history and that includes a record return on invested capital of 32.7%. We no doubt benefited from 29% lower economic jet fuel prices. Obviously, that was a major component of our earnings, but so were record load factors and our revenues were up also a very solid 5.6%. 
It was a strategic year for us in that we had secular growth opportunities out of Dallas arising from the repeal of the Wright Amendment and of course that has been a phenomenal success. We've also had secular growth opportunities out of Washington Reagan and LaGuardia that is arising from the acquisition of slots. It was also a year that followed the -- at the end of 2014, the completion of the AirTran acquisition and integration. A lot of new markets resulted from that. And then, of course, it was also a year where we had a unique opportunity in which to build an international terminal and launch international flights out of Houston Hobby. That was for the first time since 1969, by the way. All of that added up to capacity growth of 7.2%, and then of course, we were delighted that traffic was stronger than that, it grew 8.8%. 
And as a backdrop, the economy for last year was solid. Travel demand was solid, and of course, energy prices moved even lower. So the convergence of all of these things made 2015 a very successful year, but again, one that was also very strategic for us. 
And we accomplished virtually everything that we set out to do. In some cases where we didn't, we at least made significant progress. I'm very happy about that, but certainly that includes generating record operating cash flow, strong free cash flow and we also returned a record $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
So I want to make sure that I highlight 2 announcements from this morning's release. First of all, we announced that we will soon launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, I'm sure you all saw that. And then second, we recently ordered 33 new 737-800s from Boeing and that is spread out for delivery in '16, '17 and '18. And the sole purpose for that is to accelerate further the retirement of our classic fleet. So mechanically, we did that by exercising 6 options and then on top of that we placed new orders for 27 more. So you get to 33 more new airplanes. And then in addition to that, on our fleet chart, you'll also see that we have committed to 2 more used aircraft. But I just want to reiterate that our capacity plans for the next 5 years are essentially unchanged by this announcement. We're replacing the classics with next-generation airplanes. 
And then, in particular, our capacity plans for 2016 are unchanged, and we still plan to grow this year between 5% and 6%.
So the financial operations and customer service effects of this fleet announcement are all very favorable, and Tammy will take us through all that.
Work continues along 3 basic themes this year as far as investment goes for the future. One is we have significant airport renovation and infrastructure projects underway across the country. Some we're managing, some we're not, but big project in LAX, Fort Lauderdale, Chicago Midway and New Orleans and that Fort Lauderdale, in particular, will bring on new capacity for us in 2017. 
Number two, we've got a significant commercial technology program underway. And the headline on that, of course, is the replacement of our reservation system and that's also targeted for 2017. 
And then, finally, we have a major program underway with our operations technology. And the headline on that is the new 737 MAX, along with other very significant technology improvements that Mike Van De Ven has planned and that is also a 2017 deliverable, at least with respect to the MAX. 
So for this year, in addition to our focus on these investment programs, we want to do a handful of things. We want to continue to manage our network growth and mature our developing markets; number two, we want to compete vigorously in an increasingly competitive environment; number three, we want to continue to work on and improve our reliability of our operations; next, we want to continue our focus on the hospitality of our customer service, and through all of this, we want to continue to grow our unit revenues, our margins and our earnings. So there's nothing really fancy about that or 2016, pretty basic blocking and tackling things, but clearly 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for Southwest Airlines.
I just want to highlight for our Southwest people finally that our profit sharing for 2015 will eclipse last year's record and increase by 74% to an all-time record of $620 million, and I'm very pleased about that. I'm very proud of them and their hard work. And I am very pleased with their being justly rewarded with that. 
So Tammy, with that quick overview, I'd love to turn it over to you and have you take us through the quarter."

We are very pleased to report a banner year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43rd consecutive year of profits. Our annual earnings, excluding special items, were a record $2.4 billion or $3",2229,"All right, thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are very pleased to report a banner year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43rd consecutive year of profits. Our annual earnings, excluding special items, were a record $2.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted share, which was an increase of 75% year-over-year. 
Our fourth quarter performance was also record-setting, representing -- and represented our 11th consecutive quarter of profit. Fourth quarter net income, excluding special items, increased 46% year-over-year to $591 million or $0.90 per share, which was in line with consensus. 
Operating income, excluding special items, was a record $992 million, which produced a 5-point improvement in operating margin of 19.9%, which is the best fourth quarter margin performance we've seen since 1978. 
And it's also worth noting like last quarter, with or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. 
And the record that really stands out is our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, of 32.7%. 
I'd like to congratulate all of our outstanding employees on these fantastic results. And like Gary, I'm thrilled we can reward our employees with a record-breaking profit sharing of $620 million for 2015.
Our total operating revenues in fourth quarter were a record $5 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year on a capacity increase of 8.4%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.6 billion. 
Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in more than 11% growth in traffic and an all-time fourth quarter high -- record-high load factor. 
A softer yield environment resulted in a 7% decline in passenger revenue yields and an $8 decrease in our average fare. 
Our fourth quarter operating revenues included a $125 million net benefit from the amended Chase contract and the required accounting treatment. And this $125 million benefit was about a 2- to 3-point improvement to RASM.
For 2016, we expect to realize a year-over-year incremental benefit from the amended Chase agreement and accounting change. But once we reach third quarter, we will, of course, lapse the year-over-year benefit. For first quarter 2016, our estimated incremental benefit is approximately $110 million and that is included in the RASM guidance that we provided. 
Our developmental markets continued to perform in line with our expectations. And Dallas continues to outperform the system on margins and returns.
International is also developing as planned including our inaugural service from Houston, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter RASM declined 0.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Considering a point impact from development markets and roughly 2-point impact from increased gauge and stage, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter record, and likely, industry-leading revenue performance.
Thus far, in January, demand for our low fares remains strong. Soft yet stable yields have continued thus far into first quarter. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are estimating first quarter 2016 RASM will be flat year-over-year. In light of the current yield environment, we're very pleased with our first quarter revenue outlook at this juncture.
Our freight and other revenue production was also favorable. In addition to the incremental benefit from the amended Chase card that I mentioned earlier, our ancillary revenue production was strong, led by growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding revenues. And we currently expect first quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to be comparable with fourth quarter 2015.
I'll turn to our cost performance now. And our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding special items, decreased just under 7% year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control, particularly our fleet modernization effort. Our economic fuel costs decreased almost $200 million year-over-year and that was driven by the 23% decline in fuel prices. With the current state of the oil market and oversupply situation, we currently expect another year-over-year decline in first quarter and full year 2016 economic fuel costs.
Based on our current hedge portfolio for this year and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price to be approximately $1.70 per gallon, and I'll also provide you our estimates by quarter here. Second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.60 per gallon. And second half, we expect that to be in the $1.80 to $1.95 per gallon range again based on last Friday. And that brings us to a full year 2016 fuel price per gallon in the $1.70 to $1.75 range.
So while above market prices, we're still benefiting from lower fuel prices and currently estimate over $500 million in economic fuel savings this year. Our first quarter 2016 estimated fuel price per gallon is below last year's $2 per gallon and represents the lowest economic fuel price we've realized since third quarter of 2006. 
With respect to our hedge book. Our strong profit -- our strong profit margins today call for a more conservative approach to hedging in this environment -- in this low fuel environment. We will continue to manage our existing portfolio to minimize costs as we burn off our 2016 and 2017 positions. Prospectively, we'll focus on catastrophic protection with no downside risk, particularly in this environment. For 2018, as we reported, we are 35% hedged and that's with all calls and call spreads. So while our hedging philosophy has not changed, our tactics have in this environment. And we will manage through our portfolio, and this -- since fourth quarter of 2015, we participated in 85% of the market decline.
So I'll take you through our nonfuel costs quickly. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were flat, including a 36% year-over-year increase in profit sharing that our employees earned for fourth quarter 2015. Profit sharing expense accrued in the fourth quarter was $136 million and that brings again the total for the year to an astounding $620 million, which, again, was 75% year-over-year. 
Excluding profit sharing and special items, our nonfuel unit costs decreased 1.1% year-over-year, which was towards the more favorable end of our cost guidance due primarily to reduction in advertise spend and lower airport costs than we had expected. 
Our fleet modernization produced the expected $700 million in EBIT this year and that's even with the drop in fuel prices. 
So based on our current cost trends, we expect first quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And keep in mind that roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation, which, of course, is a noncash charge from our recent decision to accelerate the retirement of the classic fleet that Gary took you through.
For our full year 2016, we are currently estimating a 1% year-over-year increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And again, this modest cost inflation is almost entirely driven by the accelerated depreciation. 
And as a quick reminder, as we noted in our press release this morning, this cost guidance only reflects current labor contracts. Therefore, it does not include the impact from the tentative agreement currently out for vote with our ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo vote.
I'll move to our balance sheet and cash flow. And of course, our balance sheet and cash flows remained very strong. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and that's after posting $835 million in cash collateral to third parties. We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2015 and incurred $2 billion in capital expenditures. 
For 2016, we continue to estimate CapEx of approximately $2 billion, and I'll cover our aircraft CapEx when I review our fleet plans here shortly.
We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015, which exceeded our free cash flow of $1.1 billion. And we will have $200 million remaining on the $1.5 billion purchase program after we launch our $500 million accelerated share repurchase, which we will be doing soon. 
We repaid $213 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2015 and issued $500 million senior unsecured notes at an all-time low 2.65%. And this was in light of our debt maturities of approximately $600 million here in 2016. 
Our leverage including off-balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low to mid-30% range. And of course, we are very proud of our strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating that was further strengthened during fourth quarter with an upgrade by Fitch to BBB+ and that followed an upgrade in July by Moody's to Baa1. 
We're focused on preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows while continuing our long-standing track of returning significant value to our shareholders.
I'll move now to our fleet and capacity plans. We ended 2015 with 704 aircraft in our fleet, as planned and outlined in this morning's release. Our press release also included our future delivery schedule that I'd point you to that we restructured at the end of December in conjunction with our decision to further accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet. 
I'll quickly take you through the revisions, that they included the conversion of our remaining 25 next-gen -700 firm orders to next-gen -800 firm orders and it included the addition, as Gary mentioned, of 33 -800 firm deliveries. And as he noted, some of those were options that we had exercised. And we had 2 additional used -700s. We now intend to retire our classic fleet no later than mid-2018 and that's compared to our previous plan that had retirements carrying into 2021. And we had 129 classic aircraft in our fleet at year-end.
Roughly 2/3 of our classic aircraft were impacted by our decision to further accelerate the retirement. And the incremental seat gauge and aircraft in our restructured order book is intended to backfill these aircraft while maintaining our current plans to keep our year-over-year fleet growth over the next 3 years to no more than 2% on average.
The accelerated retirement plan is estimated to produce cumulative EBIT improvement of approximately $200 million over the acceleration period and that's primarily through maintenance and fuel cost savings. And I'd also note that this incorporates the approximate $100 million in accelerated depreciation that I referred to earlier. 
And the overall customer experience will improve as well with the fully WiFi-equipped, more modernized fleet. 
Our future firm capital commitments increased approximately $400 million as a result of the order book revisions. And our 2015 capital expenditures increased $200 million to $300 million and that was primarily related -- or that was related to the restructuring of our order book. 
Our aircraft CapEx for 2016 is still estimated to fall in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. And our average aircraft CapEx for 2017 and 2018 combined is currently estimated to be in a similar range as 2016, which is very manageable.
While the details of our Boeing agreement are confidential, the economics of our NG order book are very supportive of our continued fleet modernization effort. 
Overall, the internal rate of return on accelerating the retirement of our classic fleet is estimated to exceed our -- the return of investment, and this is after-tax, which we reported here in 2015 of almost 21% so it was a very easy decision for us. We are still optimizing our retirement schedule over the next few years, but we expect to end 2016 with roughly 720 aircraft.
With regards to capacity. We ended 2015 as planned and we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. And as we previously noted, the majority of 2016's capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of our 2015 expansion.
So in conclusion. We ended an exceptionally strong 2015 with a record fourth quarter, and our outlook for first quarter calls for another quarter of strong operating margins approaching 20%. Despite a soft yield environment, demand held strong producing record revenues. We currently estimate our first quarter RASM will be flat year-over-year based on revenue and booking trends thus far in 2016, which suggest continuation of the strong-demand, soft-yield environment. 
Substantially lower fuel prices and other cost controls contributed to our favorable cost performance in 2015. And our outlook for 2016 calls for modest cost inflation, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing and again that was driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and an EBIT improvement in the $200 million range. We continue to benefit from lower fuel prices and currently estimate this year's fuel costs to be more than $500 million lower year-over-year based on last Friday's prices and including our current fuel hedge.
Our balance sheet is industry-leading and our cash flows remain strong. And as ever, we are committed to creating value, and we are very pleased that we were able to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015. 
And as we announced this morning, we will be launching our $500 million accelerated share repurchase soon, which will leave $200 million remaining on our outstanding $1.5 billion buyback authorization. 
And again, our pretax return on invested capital was an astounding 32.7%. 
I would like to close by thanking all of our employees for their outstanding contribution to these very strong results.
So with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions."

So let me move on to Gary here and another question on labor. Given your history of profitability, it's no surprise that your 737 wage rates came to represent the peak for U.S. airlines easily over the last decade. But as the competitor wage bar begins to rise above yours currently, is it inevitable that Southwest has to establish a new peak with every successful contract? Or put differently, is your business model predicated on maintaining above-market pay scales? Or was that just a by-product of how poorly the competition was at one point?"

Not -- there's never been a promise to be the highest-paying airline in the industry. And so to the extent that we're able to do that because we produce great results, I think that is terrific. But all of that needs to obviously be negotiated with our labor groups and that's what happens and that's the way that works. But I think the overriding objective for us is to continue to have a healthy company, meaning that we're safe and that we're financially strong. And in order to do that, we've got to continue to offer great service and at -- our objective is to be the low-cost producer and live up to the low-fare brand promise that we have."

The only thing I would -- the only edit I would make is that actually when we acquired AirTran, their costs were not lower than ours interestingly enough, at least by my analysis. But clearly, there are carriers today whose costs are lower. On that point, you and I certainly agree. And I -- first of all, I think that it is inevitable that, over time, that an industry will get more competitive, especially when there's a disruptor as there has been with Southwest Airlines. So it is not shocking at all that we have more intense competition today than at any time in our history. And it is a challenge for our company and something that I'm very confident that our people will rise up to that challenge. But indeed, it will put an obligation on us to continue to innovate and work very, very hard so that we don't lose our low-fare leadership position in the country. So absolutely, it is different and I think we recognize that the industry is more competitive today than it has been ever. I would quickly add, by the way, that Southwest has never been stronger. We've never had the route network. We've never had the depth and the breadth of the service that we offer. And we've never had a balance sheet this strong. We've never had earnings this strong. So it's really up to us to continue to make sure that we compete and be the best at service and price."

But we wouldn't expect our international markets, as an example, to mature at the rate we would say at Dallas or even the AirTran market. So they're all a little bit different, but I can at least help quantify the impact we're expecting here in the first quarter. And if you -- it's probably in terms of -- it's probably a 1-point, I'd call it, maybe not even a 1-point impact from development markets.

The -- I would admit to you all that it is -- the year is off to a very concerning start when it comes to headlines around the world. It's almost as if we're living in a different dimension here at Southwest and from what I've heard from some of our competitor reports, too. So our business continues to be strong, but I will quickly admit that there are concerning headlines around the world. So if you translate this to oil prices, and living in Texas my entire life, this is an oil and gas state, and yes, it is concerning the impact that it will have on companies and debt payments and jobs and so on. There's no question that the United States has benefited from the oil and gas boom that was occurring over the last X number of years since the -- really since the recession. So yes, that's all a concern that no doubt you have, we share that. But at least in terms of seeing any manifestation of that in our business, we just -- we don't see it. Even our oil and gas markets, if you want to call them that, produced very strong results in the fourth quarter. Several of our markets have year-over-year yield pressure, if you will, so that's not unique to those markets, but they still produced very, very handsome returns. But yes, it's just something we're going to have to keep our eye on. And I offer that background just as an acknowledgment that we're just living in a world where we need to continue to be alert and be cautious. I will then follow on and say that we felt like our plan for 2015 was sound and it turned out to be so. We think that the follow-on plan here for 2016 is also sound. It is more conservative than what we had committed ourselves to for last year. And as Tammy and I have both reiterated, we've not made any change with our capacity outlook and especially for 2016. We're still right in the 5% to 6% range. And I think all of us would be prepared that if, for whatever reason, travel demand weakens, then we would be -- we would want to address that and then at least discuss what kind of options we have to react on the downside. But in terms of taking advantage -- further advantage of low energy prices and boosting our capacity, we don't have any plans to do that. So Tammy, before we go on to the second question, anything you would like to add?"

And in terms of the -- your question on why did we decide to accelerate the classics, I guess, I'd just point back to our fleet modernization efforts that when we set our plan, I guess I just have to say we've been very pleased with the benefits from our fleet modernization so far. And as we continued to evaluate just the operating costs of operating classic as it dwindles in size, we just really took out our pencils, evaluated it and we were able to come up with a plan that actually is going to enable us to improve our EBIT with very -- at very modest capital levels. So I think you know Southwest well. We prefer a simplified fleet. And even though the classics fleet of 737, we'd much prefer to operate 700s and 800s, and it certainly simplifies a lot of the operations and also just improves the reliability in terms of just less downtime from a maintenance perspective. So I think we'll get -- also get a boost from the productivity of our fleet, which certainly was part of the EBIT contribution that we're expecting. So all in all, when we sat down and evaluated it, it became pretty compelling to go ahead and accelerate the classics. So hopefully, that helps provide a little color as to what went into the decision-making process. Gary, did you have anything?"

And I think it's back to that convergence or confluence of things. First of all, we're at a fleet number that is manageable to think about accelerating retirement in that way. We have more out-of-service time with those airplanes for maintenance reasons than we do the rest of our fleet. So -- and Tammy made that point, I just want to reiterate. You will get a lot more productivity out of a new airplane than what we are currently getting out of these classics, which means you don't necessarily even have to have a tail-by-tail replacement, although that is our plan. But they'll be more efficient. The other thing is that Boeing was available to us. Boeing had delivery positions and we were able to strike a deal with them in a way that was -- that worked for them, was a win for them, it was a win for us. So that was key. With respect to our people, think about the people who have to touch the airplane, the pilots, flight attendants, mechanics especially, it's just far easier for our people to operate the next-gen than it is the classics. That's just a fact. So this will simplify a lot of things for all 3 of those workgroups, and in particular, our pilots. So it's a good deal. It works out -- it'll be better for our customers. And all the way around, we're just delighted that we have this alternative available and we were able to pull it all together at the end of the year. But it was an idea and a decision that was aggressively pursued in 2015, in fact, the latter part of 2015 and fortunately it all came together."

Or is it -- if this a truly like a commodity business and you just have to be -- have the lowest fares?"

I love everybody's question, but that, I think, that's one that's an interesting one to share and I'm happy to have an opportunity to address it. We want to be the best service at the lowest price, period. And in describing price, I would agree that we're going to have to do some comparisons between unbundled pricing versus our more bundled approach. All-in, I want Southwest Airlines to be the lowest price. We'll win if we have the best service at the lowest price. And that's been our tradition, that's been our history, that's what the whole company is based upon and that's what our growth plans are fundamentally based upon. I think it is a slippery slope to accept that our cost and our fares can be higher based on service because, as you well know, there is a long list of failures in the airline industry who pursue that exact strategic plan. And it's really a cop-out, it's really not facing up to the challenges of finding more and better ways to compete on cost and on price. So the thing I love about Southwest is it's been a company who's been able to do both. And the other thing that you find, I think, which is a slippery slope is companies can change. And while service may not be a great attribute for some of our competitors today who will go unnamed, who's to say that they can't change that in the future? And so we need to continue to strive to be the best at both and we need -- while we may not have all the answers in any given point in time, I think that, that needs to continue to be our guiding light."

Then on the other, we did hear that some airlines just ran a better operation because the winter weather wasn't that bad.

I think the thing that's -- and Tammy will have better insights, no doubt, but the thing that stands out to me was Thanksgiving. We were pretty much tracking along with our forecast for the quarter until then. And it was all -- if you'll recall our discussion with our November traffic, the pricing environment was not -- it was -- I used the word, it was quoted at the time, it was unusual. So the Christmas holiday period was more normal. But regardless, you kind of fast-forward now, and Tammy, maybe you -- maybe it might be more helpful to talk about current trends as opposed to what changed but that -- Mike, that was the main thing that I recall in the fourth quarter was the yields over the week of Thanksgiving holiday travel based on unusual discounting in the industry were lower than what we would have predicted.

So as we're just trying to sort through all of that, I would just -- our expectation going into the first quarter, based on what we've seen so far in January, is demand seems strong. We're continuing to see strong load factors. But again, we're also continuing to see those come in at weaker yields. So that -- so at least, I guess the way I would characterize it, at least from what we're seeing so far, in our bookings is stabilized."

That's hard to tease out of all that. But the other thing that's going on here is you look at the broader GDP results for the fourth quarter and they weren't very good. So it's possible that the industry was seeing some softening in demand that led to more aggressive discounting and it's coupled with the industry also growing faster than GDP. So it wouldn't be shocking to find that there was a little bit of a rough patch there and just trying to get supply and demand cleared at the right price. But in any event, beyond that, we're continuing to manage our developing markets. We're continuing to manage our markets in which there are competitive changes in terms of pluses and minuses in activity. And overall, the demand, as we said, demand it all adds up to a, I think, a very solid outlook. And I'll just reiterate one more time that our results are not adjusted for the difference in stage length and gauge. If you do that, we're turning in positive unit revenue performances in the fourth quarter, for the full year 2015 and that would also continue to be our outlook in the first quarter."

This was another superb and critical year for Southwest, and I am very grateful to all of our people for their hard work. I want to especially thank them for these terrific results. 
Tammy is going to take us through the quarter, but I want to offer up not a comprehensive overview, but at least a few highlights. Of course, this was, by far, our best year of earnings in our entire history and that includes a record return on invested capital of 32.7%. We no doubt benefited from 29% lower economic jet fuel prices. Obviously, that was a major component of our earnings, but so were record load factors and our revenues were up also a very solid 5.6%. 
It was a strategic year for us in that we had secular growth opportunities out of Dallas arising from the repeal of the Wright Amendment and of course that has been a phenomenal success. We've also had secular growth opportunities out of Washington Reagan and LaGuardia that is arising from the acquisition of slots. It was also a year that followed the -- at the end of 2014, the completion of the AirTran acquisition and integration. A lot of new markets resulted from that. And then, of course, it was also a year where we had a unique opportunity in which to build an international terminal and launch international flights out of Houston Hobby. That was for the first time since 1969, by the way. All of that added up to capacity growth of 7.2%, and then of course, we were delighted that traffic was stronger than that, it grew 8.8%. 
And as a backdrop, the economy for last year was solid. Travel demand was solid, and of course, energy prices moved even lower. So the convergence of all of these things made 2015 a very successful year, but again, one that was also very strategic for us.  And we accomplished virtually everything that we've set out to do. In some cases where we didn't, we at least made significant progress. I'm very happy about that, but certainly that includes generating record operating cash flow, strong free cash flow and we also returned a record $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
So I want to make sure that I highlight 2 announcements from this morning's release. First of all, we announced that we will soon launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, I'm sure you all saw that. And then second, we recently ordered 33 new 737-800s from Boeing and that is spread out for delivery in '16, '17 and '18. And the sole purpose for that is to accelerate further the retirement of our classic fleet. So mechanically, we did that by exercising 6 options and then on top of that we placed new orders for 27 more. So you get to 33 more new airplanes. And then in addition to that, on our fleet chart, you'll also see that we have committed to 2 more used aircraft. But I just want to reiterate that our capacity plans for the next 5 years are essentially unchanged by this announcement. We're replacing the classics with next-generation airplanes. And then, in particular, our capacity plans for 2016 are unchanged, and we still plan to grow this year between 5% and 6%. So the financial, operations and customer service effects of this fleet announcement are all very favorable, and Tammy will take us through all that.
Work continues along 3 basic themes this year as far as investment goes for the future. One is we have significant airport renovation and infrastructure projects underway across the country. Some we're managing, some we're not, but a big project in LAX, Fort Lauderdale, Chicago Midway and New Orleans and that Fort Lauderdale, in particular, will bring on new capacity for us in 2017. Number two, we've got a significant commercial technology program underway. And the headline on that, of course, is the replacement of our reservation system and that's also targeted for 2017. And then, finally, we have a major program underway with our operations technology. And the headline on that is the new 737 MAX, along with other very significant technology improvements that Mike Van De Ven has planned and that is also a 2017 deliverable, at least with respect to the MAX. 
So for this year, in addition to our focus on these investment programs, we want to do a handful of things. We want to continue to manage our network growth and mature our developing markets; number two, we want to compete vigorously in an increasingly competitive environment; number three, we want to continue to work on and improve our reliability of our operations; next, we want to continue our focus on the hospitality of our customer service, and through all of this, we want to continue to grow our unit revenues, our margins and our earnings. So there's nothing really fancy about that or 2016, pretty basic blocking and tackling things, but clearly 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for Southwest Airlines.
I just want to highlight for our Southwest people finally that our profit sharing for 2015 will eclipse last year's record and increase by 74% to an all-time record of $620 million, and I'm very pleased about that. I'm very proud of them and their hard work. And I am very pleased that they're being justly rewarded with that. 
So Tammy, with that quick overview, I'd love to turn it over to you and have you take us through the quarter."

We are very pleased to report a banner year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43rd consecutive year of profits.

We are very pleased to report a banner year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43rd consecutive year of profits. Our annual earnings, excluding special items, were a record $2.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted share, which was an increase of 75% year-over-year. 
Our fourth quarter performance was also record-setting, representing -- represented our 11th consecutive quarter of profit. Fourth quarter net income, excluding special items, increased 46% year-over-year to $591 million or $0.90 per share, which was in line with consensus.  Operating income, excluding special items, was a record $992 million, which produced a 5-point improvement in operating margin of 19.9%, which is the best fourth quarter margin performance we've seen since 1978. And it's also worth noting like last quarter, with or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. And the record that really stands out is our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, of 32.7%.  I'd like to congratulate all of our outstanding employees on these fantastic results. And like Gary, I'm thrilled we can reward our employees with a record-breaking profit sharing of $620 million for 2015. 
Our total operating revenues in fourth quarter were a record $5 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year on a capacity increase of 8.4%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.6 billion.  Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in more than 11% growth in traffic and an all-time fourth quarter high -- record-high load factor. A softer yield environment resulted in a 7% decline in passenger revenue yields and an $8 decrease in our average fare. Our fourth quarter operating revenues included a $125 million net benefit from the amended Chase contract and the required accounting treatment. And this $125 million benefit was about a 2- to 3-point improvement to RASM.
For 2016, we expect to realize a year-over-year incremental benefit from the amended Chase agreement and accounting change. But once we reach third quarter, we will, of course, lapse the year-over-year benefit. For first quarter 2016, our estimated incremental benefit is approximately $110 million and that is included in the RASM guidance that we provided.  Our developmental markets continue to perform in line with our expectations. And Dallas continues to outperform the system on margins and returns.
International is also developing as planned including our inaugural service from Houston, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter RASM declined 0.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Considering a point impact from development markets and roughly 2-point impact from increased gauge and stage, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter record, and likely, industry-leading revenue performance.
Thus far, in January, demand for our low fares remains strong. Soft yet stable yields have continued thus far into first quarter. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are estimating first quarter 2016 RASM will be flat year-over-year. In light of the current yield environment, we're very pleased with our first quarter revenue outlook at this juncture. Our freight and other revenue production was also favorable. In addition to the incremental benefit from the amended Chase card that I mentioned earlier, our ancillary revenue production was strong, led by growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding revenues. And we currently expect first quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to be comparable with fourth quarter 2015.
I'll turn to our cost performance now. And our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding special items, decreased just under 7% year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control, particularly our fleet modernization effort. Our economic fuel costs decreased almost $200 million year-over-year and that was driven by the 23% decline in fuel prices. With the current state of the oil market and oversupply situation, we currently expect another year-over-year decline in first quarter and full year 2016 economic fuel costs.
Based on our current hedge portfolio for this year and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price to be approximately $1.70 per gallon, and I'll also provide you our estimates by quarter here. Second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.60 per gallon. And second half, we expect that to be in the $1.80 to $1.95 per gallon range again based on last Friday. And that brings us to a full year 2016 fuel price per gallon in the $1.70 to $1.75 range. So while above market prices, we're still benefiting from lower fuel prices and currently estimate over $500 million in economic fuel savings this year. Our first quarter 2016 estimated fuel price per gallon is below last year's $2 per gallon and represents the lowest economic fuel price we've realized since third quarter of 2006. 
With respect to our hedge book. Our strong profit margins today call for a more conservative approach to hedging in this environment -- in this low fuel environment. We will continue to manage our existing portfolio to minimize costs as we burn off our 2016 and 2017 positions. Prospectively, we'll focus on catastrophic protection with no downside risk, particularly in this environment. For 2018, as we reported, we are 35% hedged and that's with all calls and call spreads. So while our hedging philosophy has not changed, our tactics have in this environment. And we will manage through our portfolio, and this -- since fourth quarter of 2015, we participated in 85% of the market decline.
So I'll take you through our nonfuel costs quickly. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were flat, including a 30% year-over-year increase in profit sharing that our employees earned for fourth quarter 2015. Profit sharing expense accrued in the fourth quarter was $136 million and that brings again the total for the year to an astounding $620 million, which, again, was 75% year-over-year. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our nonfuel unit costs decreased 1.1% year-over-year, which was towards the more favorable end of our cost guidance due primarily to a reduction in advertise spend and lower airport costs than we had expected. Our fleet modernization produced the expected $700 million in EBIT this year and that's even with the drop in fuel prices. 
So based on our current cost trends, we expect first quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And keep in mind that roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation, which, of course, is a noncash charge from our recent decision to accelerate the retirement of the classic fleet that Gary took you through. For our full year 2016, we are currently estimating a 1% year-over-year increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And again, this modest cost inflation is almost entirely driven by the accelerated depreciation.  And as a quick reminder, as we noted in our press release this morning, this cost guidance only reflects current labor contracts. Therefore, it does not include the impact from the tentative agreement currently out for vote with our ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo vote.
I'll move to our balance sheet and cash flow. And of course, our balance sheet and cash flows remained very strong. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and that's after posting $835 million in cash collateral to third parties. We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2015 and incurred $2 billion in capital expenditures. For 2016, we continue to estimate CapEx of approximately $2 billion, and I'll cover our aircraft CapEx when I review our fleet plans here shortly.
We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015, which exceeded our free cash flow of $1.1 billion. And we will have $200 million remaining on the $1.5 billion purchase program after we launch our $500 million accelerated share repurchase, which we will be doing soon. We repaid $213 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2015 and issued $500 million senior unsecured notes at an all-time low 2.65%. And this was in light of our debt maturities of approximately $600 million here in 2016. 
Our leverage including off-balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low to mid-30% range. And of course, we are very proud of our strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating that was further strengthened during fourth quarter with an upgrade by Fitch to BBB+ and that followed an upgrade in July by Moody's to Baa1. We're focused on preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows while continuing our long-standing track of returning significant value to our shareholders.
I'll move now to our fleet and capacity plans. We ended 2015 with 704 aircraft in our fleet, as planned and outlined in this morning's release. Our press release also included our future delivery schedule that I'd point you to that we restructured at the end of December in conjunction with our decision to further accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet. 
I'll quickly take you through the revisions, that they included the conversion of our remaining 25 next-gen -700 firm orders to next-gen -800 firm orders and it included the addition, as Gary mentioned, of 33 -800 firm deliveries. And as he noted, some of those were options that we had exercised. And we had 2 additional used -700s. We now intend to retire our classic fleet no later than mid-2018 and that's compared to our previous plan that had retirements carrying into 2021. And we had 129 classic aircraft in our fleet at year-end.
Roughly 2/3 of our classic aircraft were impacted by our decision to further accelerate the retirement. And the incremental seat gauge and aircraft in our restructured order book is intended to backfill these aircraft while maintaining our current plans to keep our year-over-year fleet growth over the next 3 years to no more than 2% on average. The accelerated retirement plan is estimated to produce cumulative EBIT improvement of approximately $200 million over the acceleration period and that's primarily through maintenance and fuel cost savings. And I'd also note that this incorporates the approximate $100 million in accelerated depreciation that I referred to earlier. And the overall customer experience will improve as well with the fully WiFi-equipped, more modernized fleet. 
Our future firm capital commitments increased approximately $400 million as a result of the order book revisions. And our 2015 capital expenditures increased $200 million to $300 million and that was primarily related -- or that was related to the restructuring of our order book. Our aircraft CapEx for 2016 is still estimated to fall in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. And our average aircraft CapEx for 2017 and 2018 combined is currently estimated to be in a similar range as 2016, which is very manageable. While the details of our Boeing agreement are confidential, the economics of our NG order book are very supportive of our continued fleet modernization effort. 
Overall, the internal rate of return on accelerating the retirement of our classic fleet is estimated to exceed our -- the return of investment, and this is after-tax, which we reported here in 2015 of almost 21% so it was a very easy decision for us. We are still optimizing our retirement schedule over the next few years, but we expect to end 2016 with roughly 720 aircraft. With regards to capacity, we ended 2015 as planned and we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. And as we previously noted, the majority of 2016's capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of our 2015 expansion.
So in conclusion. We ended an exceptionally strong 2015 with a record fourth quarter, and our outlook for first quarter calls for another quarter of strong operating margins approaching 20%. Despite a soft yield environment, demand held strong producing record revenues. We currently estimate our first quarter RASM will be flat year-over-year based on revenue and booking trends thus far in 2016, which suggest a continuation of the strong-demand, soft-yield environment. 
Substantially lower fuel prices and other cost controls contributed to our favorable cost performance in 2015. And our outlook for 2016 calls for modest cost inflation, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing and again that was driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of our classic fleet, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and an EBIT improvement in the $200 million range. We continue to benefit from lower fuel prices and currently estimate this year's fuel costs to be more than $500 million lower year-over-year based on last Friday's prices and including our current fuel hedge.
Our balance sheet is industry-leading and our cash flows remain strong. And as ever, we are committed to creating value, and we are very pleased that we were able to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015. And as we announced this morning, we will be launching our $500 million accelerated share repurchase soon, which will leave $200 million remaining on our outstanding $1.5 billion buyback authorization. And again, our pretax return on invested capital was an astounding 32.7%.  I would like to close by thanking all of our employees for their outstanding contribution to these very strong results.
So with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions."

And I -- first of all, I think that it is inevitable that, over time, that an industry will get more competitive, especially when there's a disruptor as there has been with Southwest Airlines. So it is not shocking at all that we have more intense competition today than at any time in our history. And it is a challenge for our company and something that I'm very confident that our people will rise up to that challenge. But indeed, it will put an obligation on us to continue to innovate and work very, very hard so that we don't lose our low-fare leadership position in the country. So absolutely, it is different and I think we recognize that the industry is more competitive today than it has been ever. I would quickly add, by the way, that Southwest has never been stronger. We've never had the route network. We've never had the depth and the breadth of the service that we offer. And we've never had a balance sheet this strong. We've never had earnings this strong. So it's really up to us to continue to make sure that we compete and be the best at service and price."

But we wouldn't expect our international markets, as an example, to mature at the rate we would, say, a Dallas or even the AirTran markets. So they're all a little bit different, but I can at least help quantify the impact we're expecting here in the first quarter. And if you -- it's probably in terms of -- it's probably a 1-point, I'd call it, maybe not even a 1-point impact from development markets.

The -- I would admit to you all that it is -- the year is off to a very concerning start when it comes to headlines around the world. It's almost as if we're living in a different dimension here at Southwest and from what I've heard from some of our competitor reports, too. So our business continues to be strong, but I will quickly admit that there are concerning headlines around the world. So then you translate this to oil prices, and living in Texas my entire life, this is an oil and gas state, and yes, it is concerning the impact that it will have on companies and debt payments and jobs and so on. There's no question that the United States has benefited from the oil and gas boom that was occurring over the last X number of years since the -- really since the recession. So yes, that's all a concern that no doubt you have, we share that. But at least in terms of seeing any manifestation of that in our business, we just -- we don't see it. Even our oil and gas markets, if you want to call them that, produced very strong results in the fourth quarter. Several of our markets have year-over-year yield pressure, if you will, so that's not unique to those markets, but they still produced very, very handsome returns. But yes, it's just something we're going to have to keep our eye on. And I offer that background just as an acknowledgment that we're just living in a world where we need to continue to be alert and be cautious. I will then follow on and say that we felt like our plan for 2015 was sound and it turned out to be so. We think that the follow-on plan here for 2016 is also sound. It is more conservative than what we had committed ourselves to for last year. And as Tammy and I have both reiterated, we've not made any change with our capacity outlook and especially for 2016. We're still right in the 5% to 6% range. And I think all of us would be prepared that if, for whatever reason, travel demand weakens, then we would want to address that and then at least discuss what kind of options we have to react on the downside. But in terms of taking advantage -- further advantage of low energy prices and boosting our capacity, we don't have any plans to do that.

And as we continued to evaluate just the operating costs of operating classic as it dwindles in size, we just really took out our pencils, evaluated it and we were able to come up with a plan that actually is going to enable us to improve our EBIT with very -- at very modest capital levels. So I think you know Southwest well. We prefer a simplified fleet. And even though the classics fleet's a 737, we'd much prefer to operate 700s and 800s, it certainly simplifies a lot of the operations and also just improves the reliability in terms of just less downtime from a maintenance perspective. So I think we'll get -- also get a boost from the productivity of our fleet, which certainly was part of the EBIT contribution that we're expecting. So all in all, when we sat down and evaluated it, it became pretty compelling to go ahead and accelerate the classics. So hopefully, that helps provide a little color as to what went into the decision-making process. So Gary, did you have anything?"

And I think it's back to that convergence or confluence of things. First of all, we're at a fleet number that is manageable to think about accelerating retirement in that way. We have more out-of-service time with those airplanes for maintenance reasons than we do the rest of our fleet. So and Tammy made that point, I just want to reiterate. You will get a lot more productivity out of a new airplane than what we are currently getting out of these classics, which means you don't necessarily even have to have a tail-by-tail replacement, although that is our plan. But they'll be more efficient. The other thing is that Boeing was available to us. Boeing had delivery positions and we were able to strike a deal with them in a way that was -- that worked for them, and was a win for them, it was a win for us. So that was key. With respect to our people, think about the people who have to touch the airplane, the pilots, flight attendants, mechanics especially, it's just far easier for our people to operate the next-gen than it is the classics. That's just a fact. So this will simplify a lot of things for all 3 of those workgroups, and in particular, our pilots. So it's a good deal. It works out -- it'll be better for our customers. And all the way around, we're just delighted that we have this alternative available and we were able to pull it all together at the end of the year. But it was an idea and a decision that was aggressively pursued in 2015, in fact, the latter part of 2015 and fortunately it all came together."

So with all of those new routes, I think we would readily admit to you that, in some cases, we may not -- we may have too many flights in some places, we may not have enough flights in places and so there's always some tuning that continues.

I love everybody's question, but that, I think that's one that's an interesting one to share and I'm happy to have an opportunity to address it. We want to be the best service at the lowest price, period. And in describing price, I would agree that we're going to have to do some comparisons between unbundled pricing versus our more bundled approach. All-in, I want Southwest Airlines to be the lowest price. We'll win if we have the best service at the lowest price. And that's been our tradition, that's been our history, that's what the whole company is based upon and that's what our growth plans are fundamentally based upon. I think it is a slippery slope to accept that our costs and our fares can be higher based on service because, as you well know, there is a long list of failures in the airline industry who pursued that exact strategic plan. And it's really a cop-out, it's really not facing up to the challenges of finding more and better ways to compete on cost and on price. So the thing I love about Southwest is it's been a company who's been able to do both. And the other thing that you find, I think, which is a slippery slope is companies can change. And while service may not be a great attribute for some of our competitors today who will go unnamed, who's to say that they can't change that in the future? And so we need to continue to strive to be the best at both and we need -- while we may not have all the answers at any given point in time, I think that, that needs to continue to be our guiding light."

We were pretty much tracking along with our forecast for the quarter until then. And it was all -- if you'll recall our discussion with our November traffic, the pricing environment was not -- it was -- I used the word, it was quoted at the time, it was unusual. So the Christmas holiday period was more normal. But regardless, you kind of fast-forward now, and Tammy, maybe you -- maybe it might be more helpful to talk about current trends as opposed to what -- but that -- Mike, that was the main thing that I recalled in the fourth quarter was the yields over the week of Thanksgiving holiday travel based on unusual discounting in the industry were lower than what we would have predicted.

We're continuing to see strong load factors. But again, we're also continuing to see them come in at weaker yields. So that -- so at least, I guess the way I would characterize it, at least from what we're seeing so far, in our bookings is stabilized."

That's hard to tease out of all that. But the other thing that's going on here is you look at the broader GDP results for the fourth quarter and they weren't very good. So it's possible that the industry was seeing some softening in demand that led to more aggressive discounting and it's coupled with the industry also growing faster than GDP. So it wouldn't be shocking to find that there was a little bit of a rough patch there and just trying to get supply and demand cleared at the right price. So but in any event, beyond that, we're continuing to manage our developing markets. We're continuing to manage our markets in which there are competitive changes in terms of pluses and minuses in activity. And overall, the demand, as we said, demand it all adds up to a, I think, a very solid outlook. And I'll just reiterate one more time that our results are not adjusted for the difference in stage, length and gauge. If you do that, we're turning in positive unit revenue performances in the fourth quarter, for the full year 2015 and that would also continue to be our outlook in the first quarter."

We are absolutely delighted with these results and considering the quality of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service and these strong profits, it is absolutely the best start we've had to a year and over 2 decades so I'm very, very pleased.
Of course, a big driver in our 33% earnings per share growth is a lower jet fuel price but the revenue performance was also superb. This year is essentially the follow through to a healthy expansion that began back in 2014 with the repeal of the Wright Amendment and then the aggressive expansion out of Dallas Love Field and that was followed by the integration and conversion of AirTran at year end 2014 and that generated a lot of new flights in Southwest as well. Following the AirTran conversion, we launched 4 new international cities in 2015, as well as a new terminal and domestic gateway at Houston Hobby. So you add all that up and it's a 9.2% capacity growth here in the first quarter. Would certainly admit that, that is a lot and what is impressive is that our revenue growth kept pace. So we continue to experience outstanding performance out of Dallas Love Field. The rest of our developing markets are providing a very nice tailwind as well as they continue along an expected maturity path.
Last year at this time, we had about 20% of our system in development and this year because we have intentionally slowed the additions of new markets, we have only about 5% in development.
And of course as a backdrop, the industry is adding fleets aggressively. It's a very competitive environment. Of course, that's all fine with us. We have low cost and we have a great low fare brand but we've been very pleased with the consistent strong demand for the Southwest product resulting in yet another record load factor in the first quarter and numerous other records for that matter. But the point is even in the face of our growth and the in intensely competitive environment, we're doing really, really well.
And I would attribute that to a couple of things. First and foremost, to our people and the terrific service that they offer our customers every single day. I'm very proud of them and of course, I congratulate them on these great results and the record profit sharing that they've earned. I also attribute our results to our strong domestic network where we offer more seats and board more customers than any other airline.
Our marketing department, in particular, has done a terrific job of distilling our message with our advertising campaign on transparency, the customer awareness of the low fare value that you get with Southwest is very high and that timing of that campaign matches perfectly with the incredible momentum that we have had with our record rewards loyalty program. So we have a strong profitable network, we have great service, low fares with nothing to hide. We have an award-winning loyalty program and all of that served up by outstanding employees. So we are exceptionally well-positioned to compete and grow and we intend to keep it just that way.
Now before I turn it over to Tammy, I have noticed that some of the reports this morning, a little bit of confusion, so I did want to make an opening clarifying point, which is with the now early retirement of our classic fleet. I just want to be sure that everyone understands that what we said in our press release is that means that the growth rate will be less, not that our capacity will be less. So we will still grow, available seat miles under any scenario that we contemplated in 2017 compared to 2016 and then the same would be true also for 2018 as compared to 2017. The point is that the growth rates in '17 will no doubt be less than it should have been.
So Tammy, with those opening remarks, let me just turn it over to you to take us through the quarter, please, ma'am."

We're thrilled to report on our exceptionally strong first quarter results. Net income, excluding special items, increased almost 26% year-over-year to a record $567 million and earnings per share grew 33%. This represented our 12th consecutive quarter of record profit. Our revenue results remained at record levels and we continue to benefit from low fuel prices and our ongoing fleet modernization efforts. We expanded our operating margin, excluding special items to 19.7%, which is the highest it's been in more than 35 years and our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items for the 12 months ended March 2016, was 33.4%, which well exceeded our cost of capital on an after-tax basis.
Just a fantastic start to the year and I'd also like to congratulate our wonderful employees on these outstanding results and their record first quarter profit sharing of $155 million.
Our strong revenue performance in first quarter was a significant driver of our record first quarter earnings. Operating revenues grew to a record $4.8 billion and our passenger revenues also grew to record levels. Strong demand for our low friendly fares and the overall strength of our network were contributing factors to our 9.3% increase in revenues.
We're pleased with the performance of our development markets that resulted in about 1 point net tailwind to RASM in first quarter. International markets also performed in line with our expectations including our new Houston markets and Dallas continues to produce solid results with load factor expansion and strong margins in first quarter.
Our Rapid Rewards revenue production was very strong in the quarter, including approximately $125 million, a year-over-year incremental revenue from our amended co-brand agreement with Chase last July, and our ancillary revenues continued to perform very well.
Our revenue growth was in line with our capacity, resulting in flat RASM, which was industry-leading and notable considering the 1 to 2-point impact from our stage engage increase in first quarter. All around, I'm very pleased with our first quarter revenue performance.
While the weak yield environment has continued into second quarter, demand so far has remained solid and based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are expecting a modest growth in second quarter, 2016 RASM performance year-over-year. And just as a reminder again, this outlook includes roughly $125 million from the Chase agreement and accounting change that -- just as a reminder that we will lapse that year-over-year benefit in the third quarter.
Our freight revenue was down slightly year-over-year and other revenue production was boosted by the Chase agreement but also by a 12% increase in ancillary revenues, mostly from growth in EarlyBirds and our upgraded boarding product. We currently expect second quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from second quarter last year.
Turning to our cost. We are very pleased with our first quarter cost performance. Our operating unit cost, excluding special items, decreased 2.6% year-over-year from ongoing fleet modernization benefits, weather and lower jet fuel prices. Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 11% year-over-year to $1.78. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower crude and heating oil prices offset by higher hedging year-over-year. We ended up a little higher than our previous guide at the beginning of March simply due to the increase in the crude and heating oil since that time. And based on market prices as of Monday and our second quarter hedge, that remains unchanged. We currently expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.75 to $1.80 range. And for full-year 2016, we currently expect to fall in the $1.85 to $1.90 range based on current market prices.
Excluding fuel and special items, our unit cost were comparable to first quarter last year and down slightly when you also include, excuse me, exclude profit-sharing. This was better than our previous guidance due to milder weather and associated costs avoided, as well as ship to projects spend to later this year.
Based on our current cost trends, we expect second quarter 2016 CASM excluding fuel special items to profit sharing to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classics retirement. And the remainder of the cost inflation is largely as a result of timing of advertising and technology investments.
For our -- for the full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong and our cash and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We allowed our cash to build a bit as we plan to fund our 2015 profit-sharing accrual later this month and we also intend to launch a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, which will be completed next month.
Our record free cash flow was $1.2 billion as a result of strong operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and $438 million of capital spend. For our full-year 2016, we continue to estimate manageable CapEx of approximately $2 billion.
We returned a $596 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter and as I previously mentioned, we will be launching a $200 million accelerated share repurchase this month to complete our current $1.5 billion repurchase authorization and this was on the heels of returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015. Returning significant value to our shareholders remains a priority along with preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our leverage including balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low to mid-30% range and we are very proud of our strong balance sheet and we remain the only domestic airlines with an investment grade rating from all 3 rating agencies.
So before I wrap up, I'd like to spend just a little bit of time going over our announcement this morning regarding our Classics retirement fleet plans. So as you will recall in January, we announced our intent to retire our Classics fleet no later than mid-2018. Earlier this month, we made the decision to refine the acceleration date to no later than third quarter 2017 to allow for our Classics fleet to be retired ahead of our planned operating date of the Boeing -800 Max aircraft. By doing so, we'll alleviate the potential of training complexities related to operating both the classic and MAX aircraft. Boeing and FAA aren't expected to determine their training requirements of operating the Classics MAX Air until May of 2017 at the earliest, which doesn't allow adequate time to be trained and operationally ready for a 2017 MAX launch. So our preference to address the undefined FAA requirement with this segment, Classics and MAX lines. We've been working with the swap and negotiating team to come up with a mutually beneficial solution to address the segmentation but unfortunately, we've been able to come to any agreement.
So in order to move forward with our plan to watch the launch of MAX, we must proceed with a solution, which retiring our Classics fleet no later than third quarter '17 provides.
So as a result of this decision, we'll have about 50 fewer aircraft than previously planned in fourth quarter 2017, which obviously also creates less capacity. And again as Gary mentioned, we intend to have capacity growth but just this decision alone creates less capacity than what we had previously planned.
That said, we're evaluating our options given these circumstances and believe we have a lot of flexibility to manage through the temporary dip in our fleet as we did with the 717s, including utilization of our fleets.
So with that in mind, we continue to expect our year-over-year fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 to average no more than 2% and again, our annual year-over-year capacity over that period is still expected to peak this year at 5% to 6%. While we'll continue to evaluate our fleet plans based on where we are today, our aircraft CapEx forecast remains in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for this year.
And while I mentioned that before, our preference for a number of reasons would have been to segment our fleet, however, we still estimate and even improvement of at least $200 million from accelerating the Classics from the 2021 timeframe to 2017, again largely driven by maintenance and fuel savings. This is net of the impact of the estimated accelerated depreciation of approximately $130 million that will largely be expensed during 2016. And of course, accelerating our Classics retirement results in an improved customer service even faster with a fully equipped Wi-Fi suite by the end of third quarter of next year.
So with regards to capacity just again, to be clear we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. Our second and third quarter ASMs will increase in the 4% to 5% range and we will be publishing our fourth quarter schedule in May, which will go through January 4 of next year. And as we've noted previously, the majority of 2016 capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of 2015 unit expansion opportunities. While our capacity plans beyond 2016 are yet to be determined, we do expect 2017 and 2018 year-over-year ASM growth to been down from 2016's levels. We will remain disciplined in our approach to growth with our focus of flexibility to adjust and with a goal to preserve strong returns and margins.
So in conclusion, we had another record quarter with or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year, demand remains strong producing record revenues and our outlook for second quarter suggests positive operating unit revenue growth. Our cost outlook for the year is for modest inflation driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classics fleet even faster than we've previously announced, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and even improvement of at least $200 million.
Fuel prices remain lower year-over-year and we have had very strong free cash flow this year and our balance sheet is strong as ever. We've continued our commitment to reach our value to shareholders and intend to complete our current authorization with the launch of a $200 million ASR by the end of this month and we will continue to prudently manage our capital spend and we'll remain disciplined in our valuation of future growth opportunities.
Again, our pretax return on invested capital was an exceptional 33.4%. Our outlook for second quarter supports another quarter of strong margins likely in excess of first quarter's of 19.7% and with that, I'd like to close by thanking our employees again for another fantastic quarter.
So Tom, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now."

So I'll just walk you through the quarter a bit. So just at the highest level, January and February RASM were slightly down and then margin was slightly up, which got us to the roughly flat unit revenue comparison with about $15 million of benefit from Easter in March. So April, we're at RASM adjusted for Easter is currently running in line with March and as you think about the comparisons as we move forward in the quarter, we expected to improve as a result of the increased competitive environment that we began experiencing in May and June of last year. And then, of course, as a reminder again, we'll continue to have the year-over-year benefit from the Chase agreement, at least through the second quarter here. So again, I think we're positioned very well here as we start second quarter and I would just characterize the demand environment as solid. And so at this point, adjust -- we're continuing to see the same sort of trends that we saw in the first quarter."

I think it is the usual suspects that are available to us. We can tweak the utilization of the aircraft, which translates to a longer duty day of the airplane. I'm not sure that that's what we want to do but that is an option. Yes, in other words, just flying later, earlier and later in the day. We can search the used market for more 700s and we have some options as you know by our fleet chart, we have options that can be exercised as well, which would translate to more -- to be clear, that will be more capital spending. That's not in Tammy's capital spending guidance that in other words, the capital spending guidance does not assume the exercise of any options, to be clear. In no scenario that we've talked about would we bring in 50 more airplanes. And Mike, I don't recall exactly how many aircraft will be ultimately retired under the previous scenario, but I'm going to guess it was around 30 that would have been retired in one step, 30-ish. So the 50 is not quite as large as it might sound although again that's a large number but where already retiring a fair number of aircraft in 2018. So as I said in the press release, this is all manageable. It's not preferable. It's all manageable, and we're just not -- the first thing that we wanted to share with all of our team and of course you all as well is that, that is going to happen, of that being the Classic retirement acceleration. Now the company can go to work on translating that into maintenance programs for that fleet to now retire earlier that will avoid some maintenance spending as Tammy has already made clear. And then we can explore other options as far as bringing either leased equipment in or exercising some options and spending a little bit more capital. But I think the other thing just to make sure that everybody is clear in their head on is we -- our projected fleet at the end of 2018 is unaffected by any of this. So you're simply talking about accelerating retirements from 2018 into 2017. And that makes this all for us a little bit easier. And another reason why we want to be thoughtful about bringing on more airplanes to replace that. So all of that is still an open question. And as soon as we make some choices there, I'm sure we'll be sharing those."

I thought it would take us a while longer to produce the kind of results we have there. Tammy, I did glance this morning earlier, the returns out of Dallas are still right at system average, maybe just a hair below for the first quarter. So simply meaning, Hunter, that it is -- I would not call Dallas in development, clearly Bob, is going to disagree and say there are certain markets at who want to better performance but overall as an entity, it looks really good. I've never noticed any remarkable difference in the O&D mix versus connects -- Dallas versus any other place. Sounds like you've been studying this but as our intent would be to have Chicago, St. Louis, Phoenix, Baltimore -- all of those very large operation -- Houston, all of those very large operations look roughly the same. And I don't -- I'm not seeing anything that says so that it is remarkably different. And I certainly haven't seen anything so far to suggest that there is any disappointment whatsoever in Dallas."

So I'll say that the last couple of groupings that we added, which are obviously younger are continuing to develop and we'll see that confident over time. So there's still room for improvement in Dallas even though it is right at system average. The traffic mix, just because Dallas is constrained, always remember, we love to have more flights in Dallas than we can have and so because of that, were always going to bias for local traffic more than we would in an unconstrained large city like a Chicago for example. So we do -- because we could have more capacity in Dallas, Dallas will always I think slightly under weight the flow and connect traffic compared to what it could be if we were not constrained because we've got to make room for local traffic, which again there's more local traffic demand than we have room for at the gates and flights that we have in Dallas."

First of all, so I don't know that I have an explanation. You might ask United that question. But we have had great success in Houston in particular over the past 4 years as we have been working with the city to reestablish international service at Houston Hobby. That generated a significant amount of grassroots support locally to convince the city to add that service, which we were very pleased with. What we have discovered at the time when we started this in 2012 is that the airfares, especially internationally out of Bush works extraordinarily high. It doubled, in fact, the airfares compared to even to Chicago in the same airline to point south. So I think what we've been able to do is build a brand-new 5 gate terminal and the city of Houston and the community are very excited about that. We've been able to add a lot of new flights at lower fares and the community has been very excited about that. And our low-cost is such that we can offer that very profitably. We have a decades long business built up in Houston including connecting it to Midland and we just have a real strong franchise in there. We have a lot of loyal customers. We have a lot of Rapid Rewards members so anywhere from 1/3 to 40% of our customers flies on us on Business so I can assure you it's not because we don't have Business customers, we probably carry more business customers in the United States than any other airline. But I would achieve it again to again great service prior to look at what a great network that we offer. We are offering a great product, excellent on-time performance and we really made a very significant investment in the community and I think the community is pleased to know that."

We are absolutely delighted with these results and considering the quality of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service and these strong",696,"Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We are absolutely delighted with these results and considering the quality of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service and these strong profits, it is absolutely the best start we've had to a year and over 2 decades so I'm very, very pleased.
Of course, a big driver in our 33% earnings per share growth is a lower jet fuel price but the revenue performance was also superb. This year is essentially the follow through to a healthy expansion that began back in 2014 with the repeal of the Wright Amendment and then the aggressive expansion out of Dallas Love Field and that was followed by the integration and conversion of AirTran at year-end 2014 and that generated a lot of new flights in Southwest as well. Following the AirTran conversion, we launched 4 new international cities in 2015 as well as a new terminal and domestic gateway at Houston Hobby. So you add all that up and that's a 9.2% capacity growth here in the first quarter. Would certainly admit that that is a lot, and what is impressive is that our revenue growth kept pace. So we continue to experience outstanding performance out of Dallas Love Field. The rest of our developing markets are providing a very nice tailwind as well as they continue along an expected maturity path.
Last year at this time, we had about 20% of our system in development, and this year because we have intentionally slowed the additions of new markets, we have only about 5% in development.
And of course, as a backdrop, the industry is adding fleets aggressively. It's a very competitive environment. Of course, that's all fine with us. We have low cost, and we have a great low fare brand but we've been very pleased with a consistent strong demand for the Southwest product, resulting in yet another record load factor in the first quarter and numerous other records for that matter. But the point is even in the face of our growth and the intensely-competitive environment, we're doing really, really well.
And I would attribute that to a couple of things. First and foremost, to our people and the terrific service that they offer our customers every single day. I'm very proud of them and of course, I congratulate them on these great results and the record profit sharing that they've earned. I also attribute our results to our strong domestic network, where we offer more seats and board more customers than any other airline.
Our marketing department, in particular, has done a terrific job of distilling our message with our advertising campaign on transparency, the customer awareness of the low fare value that you get with Southwest is very high and that timing of that campaign matches perfectly with the incredible momentum that we have had with our record rewards loyalty program. So we have a strong profitable network. We have great service, low fares with nothing to hide. We have an award-winning loyalty program and all of that served up by outstanding employees. So we are exceptionally well positioned to compete and grow, and we intend to keep it just that way.
Now before I turn it over to Tammy, I have noticed in some of the reports this morning, a little bit of confusion, so I did want to make an opening clarifying point, which is with the now, earlier retirement of our classic fleet. I just want to be sure that everyone understands that what we said in our press release is that means that the growth rate will be less, not that our capacity will be less. So we will still grow, available seat miles under any scenario that we contemplated in 2017 compared to 2016 and then the same would be true also for 2018 as compared to 2017. The point is that the growth rates in '17 will no doubt be less than it should have been.
So Tammy, with those opening remarks, let me just turn it over to you to take us through the quarter. Please, ma'am."

We're thrilled to report on our exceptionally strong first quarter results. Net income, excluding special items, increased almost 26% year-over-year to a record $567 million and earnings per share grew 33%. This represented our 12th consecutive quarter of record profit. Our revenue results remained at record levels, and we continue to benefit from low fuel prices and our ongoing fleet modernization efforts. We expanded our operating margin, excluding special items to 19.7%, which is the highest it's been in more than 35 years and our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items for the 12 months ended March 2016, was 33.4%, which well exceeded our cost of capital on a after-tax basis.
Just a fantastic start to the year, and I'd also like to congratulate our wonderful employees on these outstanding results and their record first quarter profit sharing of $155 million.
Our strong revenue performance in first quarter was a significant driver of our record first quarter earnings. Operating revenues grew to a record $4.8 billion and our passenger revenues also grew to record levels. Strong demand for our low friendly fares and the overall strength of our network were contributing factors to our 9.3% increase in revenues.
We're pleased with the performance of our development markets that resulted in about a point net tailwind to RASM in first quarter. International markets also performed in line with our expectations, including our new Houston markets and Dallas continues to produce solid results with load factor expansion and strong margins in first quarter.
Our Rapid Rewards revenue production was very strong in the quarter, including approximately $125 million, a year-over-year incremental revenue from our amended co-brand agreement with Chase last July, and our ancillary revenues continued to perform very well.
Our revenue growth was in line with our capacity, resulting in flat RASM, which was industry leading and notable, considering the 1- to 2-point impact from our stage engage increase in first quarter. All around, very pleased with our first quarter revenue performance.
While the weak yield environment has continued into second quarter, demand so far has remained solid and based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are expecting a modest growth in second quarter, 2016 RASM performance year-over-year. And just as a reminder again, this outlook includes roughly $125 million from the Chase agreement and accounting change that -- just as a reminder that we will lapse that year-over-year benefit in the third quarter.
Our freight revenue was down slightly year-over-year and other revenue production was boosted by the Chase agreement, but also by a 12% increase in ancillary revenues, mostly from growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding product. We currently expect second quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from second quarter last year.
Turning to our cost. We are very pleased with our first quarter cost performance. Our operating unit cost, excluding special items, decreased 2.6% year-over-year from ongoing fleet modernization benefits amount to weather and lower jet fuel prices. Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 11% year-over-year to $1.78. This year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower crude and heating oil prices, offset by higher hedging settlements year-over-year. We ended up a little higher than our previous guide at the beginning of March, simply due to the increase in the crude and heating oil since that time. And based on market prices as of Monday and our second quarter hedge, that remains unchanged. We currently expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.75 to $1.80 range. And for full year 2016, we currently expect to fall in the $1.85 to $1.90 range based on current market prices.
Excluding fuel and special items, our unit cost were comparable to first quarter last year, and down slightly when you also include -- excuse me, exclude profit sharing. This was better than our previous guidance due to milder weather and associated costs avoided as well as ship to projects spend to later this year.
Based on our current cost trends, we expect second quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel special items to profit sharing to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classics retirement. And the remainder of the cost inflation is largely as a result of timing of advertising and technology investments.
For our -- for the full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong and our cash and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We allowed our cash to build a bit as we plan to fund our 2015 profit-sharing accrual later this month, and we also intend to launch a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, which will be completed next month.
Our record free cash flow was $1.2 billion as a result of strong operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and $438 million of capital spend. For our full year 2016, we continue to estimate manageable CapEx of approximately $2 billion.
We returned $596 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter and as I previously mentioned, we will be launching a $200 million accelerated share repurchase this month to complete our current $1.5 billion repurchase authorization, and this was on the heels of returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015. Returning significant value to our shareholders remains a priority along with preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows.
Our leverage, including balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range, and we are very proud of our strong balance sheet and we remain the only domestic airline with an investment grade rating from all 3 rating agencies.
So before I wrap up, I'd like to spend just a little bit of time going over our announcement this morning regarding our Classics retirement fleet plans. So as you will recall in January, we announced our intent to retire our Classics fleet no later than mid-2018. Earlier this month, we made the decision to refine the acceleration date to no later than third quarter 2017 to allow for our Classics fleet to be retired ahead of our planned operating date of the Boeing -800 Max aircraft. By doing so, we'll alleviate the potential training complexities related to operating both the Classics and MAX aircraft. Boeing and FAA aren't expected to determine their training requirements of operating the Classics/Max pair until May of 2017 at the earliest, which doesn't allow adequate time to be trained and operationally ready for a 2017 MAX launch. So our preference to address the undefined FAA requirement was to segment, Classics and MAX flying. We've been working with the swap and negotiating team to come up with a mutually beneficial solution to address the segmentation but unfortunately, we've been able to come to any agreement.
So in order to move forward with our plan to watch the launch of MAX, we must proceed with the solution, which retiring our Classics fleet no later than third quarter '17 provides.
So as a result of this decision, we'll have about 50 fewer aircraft than previously planned in fourth quarter 2017, which obviously also creates less capacity. And again as Gary mentioned, we intend to have capacity growth but just this decision alone creates less capacity than what we had previously planned.
That said, we're evaluating our options given these circumstances and believe, we have a lot of flexibility to manage through the temporary dip in our fleet as we did with the 717s, including utilization of our fleets.
So with that in mind, we continue to expect our year-over-year fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 to average no more than 2% and again, our annual year-over-year capacity over that period is still expected to peak this year at 5% to 6%. While we'll continue to evaluate our fleet plans based on where we are today, our aircraft CapEx forecast remains in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for this year.
And while I mentioned that before, our preference for a number of reasons would have been to segment our fleet, however, we still estimate even improvement of at least $200 million from accelerating the Classics from the 2021 time frame to 2017, again largely driven by maintenance and fuel savings. This is net of the impact of the estimated accelerated depreciation of approximately $130 million that will largely be expensed during 2016. And of course, accelerating our Classics retirement results in an improved customer service even faster, with a fully equipped Wi-Fi suite by the end of third quarter of next year.
So with regards to capacity just again, to be clear we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. Our second and third quarter ASMs will increase in the 4% to 5% range, and we will be publishing our fourth quarter schedule in May, which will go through January 4 of next year. And as we've noted previously, the majority of 2016 capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of 2015 unit expansion opportunities. While our capacity plans beyond 2016 are yet to be determined, we do expect 2017 and 2018 year-over-year ASM growth to bend down from 2016's level. We will remain disciplined in our approach to growth, with a focus of flexibility to adjust if needed and with a goal to preserve strong returns and margins.
So in conclusion, we had another record quarter, with or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. Demand remained strong, producing record revenues and our outlook for second quarter suggests positive operating unit revenue growth. Our cost outlook for the year is for modest inflation, driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classics fleet even faster than we'd previously announced, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and even improvement of at least $200 million.
Fuel prices remain lower year-over-year, and we have had very strong free cash flow this year and our balance sheet is strong as ever. We've continued our commitment to reach our value to shareholders, and intend to complete our current authorization with the launch of a $200 million ASR by the end of this month, and we will continue to prudently manage our capital spend and we'll remain disciplined in our evaluation of future growth opportunities.
Again, our pretax return on invested capital was an exceptional 33.4%. Our outlook for second quarter supports another quarter of strong margins, likely in excess of first quarters of 19.7% and with that, I'd like to close by thanking our employees again for another fantastic quarter.
So Tom, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now."

So I'll just walk you through the quarter a bit. So just at the highest level, January and February RASM were slightly down and then March was slightly up, which got us to the roughly flat unit revenue comparison with about $15 million of benefit from Easter in March. So April, we're at RASM adjusted for Easter is currently running in line with March and as you think about the comparisons as we move forward in the quarter, we expect that to improve as a result of the increased competitive environment that we began experiencing in May and June of last year. And then of course, as a reminder again, we'll continue to have the year-over-year benefit from the Chase agreement, at least through the second quarter here. So again, I think we're positioned very well here as we start second quarter and I would just characterize the demand environment as solid. And so at this point, adjust the -- we're continuing to see the same sort of trends that we saw in the first quarter."

I think it is the usual suspects that are available to us. We can tweak the utilization of the aircraft, which translates to a longer duty day of the airplane. I'm not sure that that's what we want to do, but that is an option. In other words, just flying later, earlier and later in the day. We can search the used market for more 700s, and we have some options as you know by our fleet chart. We have options that can be exercised as well, which would translate to more -- to be clear, that would be more capital spending. That's not in Tammy's capital spending guidance that -- in other words, the capital spending guidance does not assume the exercise of any options, to be clear. In no scenario that we've talked about would we bring in 50 more airplanes. And Mike, I don't recall exactly how many aircraft would be ultimately retired under the previous scenario, but I'm going to guess it was around 30 that would have been retired in one step, 30-ish. So the 50 is not quite as large as it might sound although again that's a real number but we were already going to retire a fair number of aircraft in 2018. So as I said in the press release, this is all manageable. It's not preferable, but it's all manageable. And we're just not -- the first thing that we wanted to share with all of our team and of course, you all as well is if that is going to happen, that being the Classic retirement acceleration. Now the company can go to work on translating that into maintenance programs for that fleet to now retire earlier. That will avoid some maintenance spending as Tammy has already made clear. And then we can explore other options as far as bringing either leased equipment in or exercising some options and spending a little bit more capital. But I think the other thing just to make sure that everybody is clear in their head on is that we -- our projected fleet at the end of 2018 is unaffected by any of this. So you're simply talking about accelerating retirements from 2018 into 2017. And that makes this all for us a little bit easier. And another reason why we want to be thoughtful about bringing on more airplanes to replace that, so all of that is still an open question. And as soon as we make some choices there, I'm sure we'll be sharing those."

So we do -- because we could have more capacity in Dallas, Dallas will always I think slightly underweight the flow and connect traffic compared to what it could be if we were not constrained because we've got to make room for local traffic, which again there's more local traffic demand than we have room for at the gates and flights that we have in Dallas."

That's one of the reasons that we need to give our team this guidance now is because Bob Jordan and his commercial team are working right now on what the schedule will be in the fourth quarter of 2017. And they've got to know how many airplanes we're going to give them to schedule. So those are questions that will be immediately thrashing through. One thing that's a priority for next year that we won't waiver on is Fort Lauderdale, completing the construction of the new international 5-gate terminal and then following through to launch international flights there. So that will be a very high and hard priority for 2017 that we'll have to potentially work around is one example.

So I don't know that I have an explanation. You might ask United that question. But we have had great success in Houston in particular over the past 4 years, as we have been working with the City to reestablish international service at Houston Hobby. That generated a significant amount of grassroot support locally to convince the City to add that service, which we are very pleased with. What we have discovered at the time when we started this in 2012 is that the airfares, especially internationally out of Bush were extraordinarily high, double, in fact, the airfares compared to even to Chicago on the same airline to point south. So I think what we've been able to do is build a brand new 5 gate terminal and the City of Houston and the community are very excited about that. We've been able to add a lot of new flights at lower fares, and the community has been very excited about that. And our low cost are such that we can offer that very profitably. We have a decade long business built up in Houston, including connecting it to Midland and we just had a real strong franchise there. We have a lot of loyal customers. We have a lot of Rapid Rewards members. So anywhere from 1/3 to 40% of our customers fly on us on business. So I can assure you it's not because we don't have business customers, we probably carry more business customers in the United States than any other airline. But I would just attribute it again to great service by our people, the great network that we offer. they're offering a great product, excellent on-time performance.

We are absolutely delighted with these results, and considering the quality of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service and these strong profits, it is absolutely the best start we've had to a year in over 2 decades so I'm very, very pleased.
Of course, a big driver in our 33% earnings per share growth is a lower jet fuel price but the revenue performance was also superb. This year is, essentially, the follow through to a healthy expansion that began back in 2014 with the repeal of the Wright Amendment and then the aggressive expansion out of Dallas Love Field and that was followed by the integration and conversion of AirTran at year-end 2014 and that generated a lot of new flights in Southwest as well. Following the AirTran conversion, we launched 4 new international cities in 2015 as well as a new terminal and domestic gateway at Houston Hobby. So you add all that up and it's a 9.2% capacity growth here in the first quarter. I would certainly admit that, that is a lot, and what is impressive is that our revenue growth kept pace. So we continue to experience outstanding performance out of Dallas Love Field. The rest of our developing markets are providing a very nice tailwind as well as they continue along an expected maturity path.
Last year at this time, we had about 20% of our system in development, and this year because we have intentionally slowed the additions of new markets, we have only about 5% in development.
And of course, as a backdrop, the industry is adding seats aggressively. It's a very competitive environment. Of course, that's all fine with us. We have low cost, and we have a great low fare brand. But we've been very pleased with the consistent strong demand for the Southwest product, resulting in yet another record load factor in the first quarter and numerous other records for that matter. But the point is even in the face of our growth and the intensely-competitive environment, we're doing really, really well.
And I would attribute that to a couple of things. First and foremost, to our people and the terrific service that they offer our customers every single day. I'm very proud of them and of course, I congratulate them on these great results and the record profit sharing that they've earned. I also attribute our results to our strong domestic network, where we offer more seats and board more customers than any other airline.
Our marketing department, in particular, has done a terrific job of distilling our message with our advertising campaign on transparency. The customer awareness of the low fare value that you get with Southwest is very high, and that timing of that campaign matches perfectly with the incredible momentum that we have had with our record rewards loyalty program. So we have a strong profitable network. We have great service, low fares with nothing to hide. We have an award-winning loyalty program and all of that's served up by outstanding employees. So we are exceptionally well positioned to compete and grow, and we intend to keep it just that way.
Now before I turn it over to Tammy, I have noticed in some of the reports this morning a little bit of confusion. So I did want to make an opening clarifying point, which is with the now earlier retirement of our classic fleet. I just want to be sure that everyone understands that what we said in our press release is that means that the growth rate will be less, not that our capacity will be less. So we will still grow available seat miles under any scenario that we've contemplated in 2017 compared to 2016, and then the same would be true also for 2018 as compared to 2017. The point is that the growth rates in '17 will no doubt be less than it could have been.
So Tammy, with those opening remarks, let me just turn it over to you to take us through the quarter. Please, ma'am."

We're thrilled to report on our exceptionally strong first quarter results. Net income, excluding special items, increased almost 26% year-over-year to a record $567 million, and earnings per share grew 33%. This represented our 12th consecutive quarter of record profit. Our revenue results remained at record levels, and we continue to benefit from low fuel prices and our ongoing fleet modernization efforts. We expanded our operating margin excluding special items to 19.7%, which is the highest it's been in more than 35 years and our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items for the 12 months ended March 2016, was 33.4%, which well exceeded our cost of capital on a after-tax basis.
Just a fantastic start to the year, and I'd also like to congratulate our wonderful employees on these outstanding results and their record first quarter profit sharing of $155 million.
Our strong revenue performance in first quarter was a significant driver of our record first quarter earnings. Operating revenues grew to a record $4.8 billion and our passenger revenues also grew to record levels. Strong demand for our low friendly fares and the overall strength of our network were contributing factors to our 9.3% increase in revenues.
We're pleased with the performance of our development markets that resulted in about a point net tailwind to RASM in first quarter. International markets also performed in line with our expectations, including our new Houston markets, and Dallas continues to produce solid results with load factor expansion and strong margins in first quarter.
Our Rapid Rewards revenue production was very strong in the quarter, including approximately $125 million, a year-over-year incremental revenue from our amended co-brand agreement with Chase last July, and our ancillary revenues continued to perform very well.
Our revenue growth was in line with our capacity, resulting in flat RASM, which was industry leading and notable, considering the 1- to 2-point impact from our stage engage [ph] increase in first quarter. All around, very pleased with our first quarter revenue performance.
While the weak yield environment has continued into second quarter, demand so far has remained solid. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends we are expecting a modest growth in second quarter, 2016 RASM performance, year-over-year. And just as a reminder again, this outlook includes roughly $125 million from the Chase agreement and accounting change. But just as a reminder that we will lapse that year-over-year benefit in the third quarter.
Our freight revenue was down slightly year-over-year and other revenue production was boosted by the Chase agreement but also by a 12% increase in ancillary revenues, mostly from growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding product. We currently expect second quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from second quarter last year.
Turning to our cost. We are very pleased with our first quarter cost performance. Our operating unit cost, excluding special items, decreased 2.6% year-over-year from ongoing fleet modernization benefits, milder weather and lower jet fuel prices. Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 11% year-over-year to $1.78. This year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower crude and heating oil prices, offset by higher hedging settlements year-over-year. We ended up a little higher than our previous guide at the beginning of March, simply due to the increase in the crude and heating oil since that time. And based on market prices as of Monday and our second quarter hedge, that remains unchanged. We currently expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.75 to $1.80 range. And for full year 2016, we currently expect to fall in the $1.85 to $1.90 range based on current market prices.
Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were comparable to first quarter last year and down slightly when you also include -- excuse me, exclude profit sharing. This was better than our previous guidance due to milder weather and the associated costs avoided as well as shift in project spend to later this year.
Based on our current cost trends, we expect second quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classics retirement. And the remainder of the cost inflation is largely as a result of timing of advertising and technology investments.
For the full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong and our cash and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We allowed our cash to build a bit as we plan to fund our 2015 profit-sharing accrual later this month, and we also intend to launch a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, which will be completed next month.
Our record free cash flow was $1.2 billion as a result of strong operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and $438 million of capital spend. For our full year 2016, we continue to estimate manageable CapEx of approximately $2 billion.
We returned $596 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter and as I previously mentioned, we will be launching a $200 million accelerated share repurchase this month to complete our current $1.5 billion repurchase authorization, and this was on the heels of returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015. Returning significant value to our shareholders remains a priority along with preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows.
Our leverage, including balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range, and we are very proud of our strong balance sheet and we remain the only domestic airline with an investment grade rating from all 3 rating agencies.
So before I wrap up, I'd like to spend just a little bit of time going over our announcement this morning regarding our Classics retirement fleet plans. So as you will recall in January, we announced our intent to retire our Classics fleet no later than mid-2018. Earlier this month, we made the decision to refine the acceleration date to no later than third quarter 2017 to allow for our Classics fleet to be retired ahead of our planned operating date of the Boeing -8 MAX aircraft. By doing so, we'll alleviate the potential training complexities related to operating both the Classics and MAX aircraft. Boeing and the FAA aren't expected to determine their training requirements of operating the Classics/Max pair until May of 2017 at the earliest, which doesn't allow adequate time to be trained and operationally ready for a 2017 MAX launch. So our preference to address the undefined FAA requirement was to segment Classics and MAX flying. We've been working with the SWAPA negotiating team to come up with a mutually beneficial solution to address the segmentation but unfortunately, we've been unable to come to an agreement.
So in order to move forward with our plan to launch the MAX, we must proceed with the solution, which retiring our Classics fleet no later than third quarter '17 provides.
So as a result of this decision, we'll have about 50 fewer aircraft than previously planned in fourth quarter 2017, which obviously also creates less capacity. And again as Gary mentioned, we intend to have capacity growth but just this decision alone creates less capacity than what we had previously planned.
That said, we're evaluating our options given these circumstances and believe we have a lot of flexibility to manage through the temporary dip in our fleet as we did with the 717s, including utilization of our fleet.
So with that in mind, we continue to expect our year-over-year fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 to average no more than 2% and again, our annual year-over-year capacity over that period is still expected to peak this year at 5% to 6%. While we'll continue to evaluate our fleet plans based on where we are today, our aircraft CapEx forecast remains in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for this year.
And while I mentioned before, our preference for a number of reasons would have been to segment our fleet, however, we still estimate even improvement of at least $200 million from accelerating the Classics from the 2021 time frame to 2017, again largely driven by maintenance and fuel savings. This is net of the impact of the estimated accelerated depreciation of approximately $130 million that will largely be expensed during 2016. And of course, accelerating our Classics retirement results in an improved customer service even faster, with a fully equipped WiFi fleet by the end of third quarter of next year.
So with regards to capacity, just again to be clear, we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. Our second and third quarter ASMs will increase in the 4% to 5% range, and we will be publishing our fourth quarter schedule in May, which will go through January 4 of next year. And as we've noted previously, the majority of 2016's capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of 2015's unique expansion opportunities. While our capacity plans beyond 2016 are yet to be determined, we do expect 2017 and 2018 year-over-year ASM growth to bend down from 2016's level. We will remain disciplined in our approach to growth, with a focus of flexibility to adjust if needed and with a goal to preserve strong returns and margins.
So in conclusion, we had another record quarter. With or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. Demand remained strong, producing record revenues and our outlook for second quarter suggests positive operating unit revenue growth. Our cost outlook for the year is for modest inflation, driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classics fleet even faster than we'd previously announced, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and even improvement of at least $200 million.
Fuel prices remain lower year-over-year, and we have had very strong free cash flow this year and our balance sheet is strong as ever. We've continued our commitment to return value to shareholders, and intend to complete our current authorization with the launch of a $200 million ASR by the end of this month, and we will continue to prudently manage our capital spend and we'll remain disciplined in our evaluation of future growth opportunities.
Again, our pretax return on invested capital was an exceptional 33.4%. Our outlook for second quarter supports another quarter of strong margins, likely in excess of first quarter's 19.7%. And with that, I'd like to close by thanking our employees again for another fantastic quarter.
So Tom, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now."

So I'll just walk you through the quarter a bit. So just at the highest level, January and February RASM were slightly down and then March was slightly up, which got us to the roughly flat unit revenue comparison with about $15 million of benefit from Easter in March. So April RASM adjusted for Easter is currently running in line with March and as you think about the comparisons as we move forward in the quarter, we expect those to improve as a result of the increased competitive environment that we began experiencing in May and June of last year. And then of course, as a reminder, again, we'll continue to have the year-over-year benefit from the Chase agreement at least through the second quarter here. So again, I think we're positioned very well here as we start second quarter and I would just characterize the demand environment as solid.

I think it is the usual suspects that are available to us. We can tweak the utilization of the aircraft, which translates to a longer duty day of the airplane. I'm not sure that that's what we want to do, but that is an option. In other words, just flying later, earlier and later in the day. We can search the used market for more 700s. And we have some options -- as you know by our fleet chart we have options that can be exercised as well, which would translate to more -- to be clear, that would be more capital spending. That's not in Tammy's capital spending guidance that -- in other words, the capital spending guidance does not assume the exercise of any options, to be clear. In no scenario that we've talked about would we bring in 50 more airplanes. And Mike, I don't recall exactly how many aircraft would be ultimately retired under the previous scenario, but I'm going to guess it was around 30 that would have been retired in one step, 30-ish. So the 50 is not quite as large as it might sound. Although again, that's a real number but we were already going to retire a fair number of aircraft in 2018. So as I said in the press release, this is all manageable. It's not preferable, but it's all manageable. And we're just not -- the first thing that we wanted to share with all of our team and, of course, you all as well is that, that is going to happen, that being the Classic retirement acceleration. Now the company can go to work on translating that into maintenance programs for that fleet to now retire earlier. That will avoid some maintenance spending as Tammy has already made clear. And then we can explore other options as far as bringing either leased equipment in or exercising some options and spending a little bit more capital. But I think the other thing just to make sure that everybody is clear in their head on is that we -- our projected fleet at the end of 2018 is unaffected by any of this. So you're simply talking about accelerating retirements from 2018 into 2017. And that makes the solve for us a little bit easier and another reason why we want to be thoughtful about bringing on more airplanes to replace that. So all of that is still an open question. And as soon as we make some choices there, I'm sure we'll be sharing those."

So there's still room for improvement in Dallas even though it is right at system average. From the traffic mix, just because Dallas is constrained, you have to always remember we would love to have more flights in Dallas than we can have. And so because of that, we're always going to bias for local traffic more than we would in an unconstrained large city like a Chicago for example. So we do -- because we could have more capacity in Dallas, Dallas will always I think slightly underweight the flow and connect traffic compared to what it could be if we were not constrained because we've got to make room for local traffic, which again there's more local traffic demand than we have room for at the gates and flights that we have in Dallas."

So I think the impact is likely larger than the point that Tammy shared with you. I think all of our folks agree with that. So we may be a little bit conservative and that may be a conservative outlook as a consequence of that. But the other thing is not only is the existing maturing, but we're also slowing down the pace of stepping in new and that's all intentional. So we'll have a pretty conservative year here in 2016 in terms of incremental flying that's being added between now and the end of the year, and that will help as well.

So by the end of the next year, by the end of 2018, we'll be back to our fleet plan, and we haven't given you a precise number there yet. So that's a little ""p"" plan. It's not etched in stone but we'll work through all of that. In the meantime, it may affect a priority or 2. It's a little premature to say. That's one of the reasons that we need to give our team this guidance now is because Bob Jordan and his commercial team are working right now on what the schedule will be in the fourth quarter of 2017. And they've got to know how many airplanes we're going to give them to schedule. So those are questions that we'll be immediately thrashing through. One thing that's a priority for next year that we won't waver on is Fort Lauderdale, completing the construction of the new international 5-gate terminal and then following through to launch international flights there. So that will be a very high and hard priority for 2017 that we'll have to potentially work around as one example.

So I don't know that I have an explanation. You might ask United that question. But we have had great success in Houston in particular over the past 4 years, as we have been working with the city to reestablish international service at Houston Hobby. That generated a significant amount of grassroot support locally to convince the city to add that service, which we are very pleased with. What we had discovered at the time when we started this in 2012 is that the airfares, especially internationally, out of Bush were extraordinarily high, double, in fact, the airfares compared even to Chicago on the same airline to points south. So I think what we've been able to do is build a brand new 5-gate terminal and the City of Houston and the community are very excited about that. We've been able to add a lot of new flights at lower fares, and the community has been very excited about that. And our low costs are such that we can offer that very profitably. We have a decades-long business built up in Houston, including connecting it to Midland and we just had a real strong franchise there. We have a lot of loyal customers. We have a lot of Rapid Rewards members. So anywhere from 1/3 to 40% of our customers fly on us on business. So I can assure you it's not because we don't have business customers. We probably carry more business customers in the United States than any other airline. But I would just attribute it, again, to great service by our people, the great network that we offer. They're offering a great product, excellent on-time performance. And we've really made a very significant investment in the community, and I think the community is appreciative of that."

As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 p.m. There was a network equipment",504,"Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 p.m. There was a network equipment failure, and the planned redundancy or backup failed as well, and this hindered the recovery efforts and especially with some of our older legacy systems. 
Ultimately, the network was virtually fully recovered and restored around 12 hours later, roughly 1 or 2 a.m. this morning. And since then, the operation, and that is airplanes and flight crews and customer re-accommodations, have been working to catch up. I want to apologize to all of our customers that were affected yesterday and today. This is absolutely not the kind of service that our customers expect or what we expect of ourselves. And of course, our 50,000 employees, jobs to serve our customers became significantly more difficult as a result of the computer failure. And I do want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their collective efforts to recover. Those efforts have been truly heroic. So hopefully after a day of recovery, things will be back to normal tomorrow morning.
Tammy's going to take us through the quarterly results and I just wanted to point out a couple of highlights. First of all, we had a record performance in many ways, traffic, revenues, load factor, earnings, return on invested capital, with a very strong quarter also in terms of customer service and operations. Next, we had very solid revenue growth on 4.8% growth in capacity, and that was driving industry leading but modest unit revenue growth of 0.6% and that was in line with our expectations. 
Revenue trends have been up and down all year. Now we're seeing softer fare trends in July, August and notably with close-in bookings, given overall industry revenue and capacity trends that we've been monitoring. None of this is shocking but it is disappointing. 
We're still anticipating strong third quarter margins and profits, strong cash flows and continuing shareholder returns. But we will need to factor these softer trends into our future plans. So for now our second half 2016 plans are unchanged but we'll continue to look carefully and evaluate our 2017 growth plans.
2017 is going to be an exciting year. We have the 737-8 being launched next year. We've got new technology being deployed next year. We are opening an international terminal in Fort Lauderdale. We've gotten our preliminary approvals to serve 3 cities in Cuba, and we have an outstanding request to add Mexico service to LAX. So a lot of exciting things going on and certainly, 2017 is going to be a very big year. 
I want to thank our people for all their hard work and the tremendous success in driving these results and also congratulate them on another quarter of record profit sharing. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the quarter."
31726,301882343,1009597,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million and excluding special items, our net interest -- net income in",1514,"Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million and excluding special items, our net interest -- net income increased 9.6% year-over-year to a record $757 million, and we grew our earnings per share almost 16% to $1.19. This was a little shy of consensus but it was right in line with our expectation and the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day. 
Our operating margins of over 23% represents a 36-year high performance. And we grew our pretax ROIC, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended June by more than 5 points to 33.5%. I'd just like to also join Gary in congratulating our outstanding employees on our 13th consecutive quarter of record profit, excluding special items, and their record quarterly profit sharing of $206 million. This brings our profit sharing accrual to $361 million for the first half of the year alone.
Second quarter revenue performance was a significant driver of these strong results. Our operating revenues grew 5.3% and our passenger revenues once again grew to record levels. The growth in our revenues exceeded our capacity growth, resulting in unit revenue growth of 0.6%, which was in line with our guidance. This RASM performance outperformed the industry and on a stage length adjusted basis, our RASM performance was even better. 
Despite the challenging fare environment, our core business was solid, with strong demand for our low fares. Load factors were at record levels throughout the quarter, and we closed second quarter with a record load factor of 85.6%. 
Revenues related to Rapid Rewards continue to be very strong. Our second quarter results reflect a net benefit of approximately $135 million related to the amendment of our Chase agreement effective in July last year. Our strong revenue performance was also supported by continued growth in other ancillary revenue.
Corporate sales were also strong although at softer yields. We continued to benefit from tailwinds from our development markets. And we're very pleased with their performance, especially in light of the challenging fare environment. International markets continue to perform in line with our expectation, with several of them producing revenue results well above system averages. Our freight revenues were in line with second quarter of last year. So to close revenue, we are very pleased with our record operating performance.
So turning to our third quarter revenue outlook. Thus far, traffic and booking trends remain strong but the fare environment continues to be a challenge. We're seeing a heavy discounting of fares, including close-in, which as we noted in the release has softened in recent weeks. Based on these trends and our current bookings and including the yield trends, we are expecting third quarter RASM to decline in the 3% to 4% range year-over-year. 
And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing benefit from the Chase amendment, and 2Q's approximately $135 million benefit is a reasonable run rate for 3Q. But we won't see the 2- to 3-point year-over-year RASM improvement in future quarters, of course, as we've lapped the July 2015 amendment date. We currently expect third quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from third quarter 2015.
And now I'll move over to our cost performance. Our second quarter costs were right in line with our expectation. Our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased modestly year-over-year largely from lower jet fuel prices. Despite a 4.8% increase in our capacity, our fuel balance only increased 4.1%, reflecting our fuel efficiency gains largely from our fuel modernization effort. 
Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 10.4%. The -- to the lower end of our guidance of $1.80 to $1.85. And based on our market prices as of Monday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.05. We're also currently forecasting that level for fourth quarter. This brings our estimate for the full year 2016 to the $1.90 to $1.95 range, which is down a bit due to the recent drop in market prices. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio beyond third quarter 2016 based on prices as of Monday, is a net liability of approximately $775 million.
And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our second quarter unit costs were also in line with guidance, up approximately 2% year-over-year. This increase is due largely to the acceleration of the depreciation of the classic fleet, the timing of advertising and technology investment, along with airframe maintenance. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to also increase approximately 2% year-over-year.
Roughly 1 point of that year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our classic retirements, with the remainder associated with increased salary wages and benefit costs from ratified agreements since third quarter 2015 as well as costs associated with technology projects. For full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
And I am going to move now to our balance sheet and cash flow. And I'll just make a few quick comments regarding the strength of our balance sheet and as well as our cash flows. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. As we reported at Investor Day, we deferred $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx to beyond 2020 as a result of our recently restructured order book with Boeing. Our capital spending remains on track to reach approximately $2 billion this year, with $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx and about $650 million in non-aircraft capital spend. 
With operating cash flows of $2.7 billion thus far this year and manageable capital spend, our free cash flow has remained strong, enabling us to continue to return value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
To quickly recap what we discussed at Investor Day last month, we completed our previous $1.5 billion buyback authorization with a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program in May and launched a $500 million ASR under our new $2 billion program, which was authorized by our board back in May. We completed that ASR last month, and we intend to launch another $250 million accelerated share repurchase here soon. Once launched, we have returned $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, and we will have $1.25 billion remaining under our authorization. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range.
And I'll just make a few comments on our fleet. We have not had any changes to our plans since we announced the restructuring of our order book with Boeing last month at Investor Day. We ended the quarter as planned with 719 aircraft in our fleet and continue to anticipate ending the year with a fleet of 723 aircraft. We are still managing to an average annual net fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 of no more than 2%. And as Gary's mentioned, our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. 
While we continue to evaluate our rate of capacity growth beyond 2016, especially in light of the current revenue environment, we still expect annual capacity growth in 2017 and 2018 to be less than this year. We remain disciplined in our approach to growth with a focus, of course, on flexibility to adjust, if needed, with a goal to preserve our strong returns and margins.
And now just to quickly recap for you. This was another quarter of record profits, outstanding margins and strong cash flows. Demand for low fares is strong and we continue to produce record load factors. The revenue yield environment remains challenging with heavy fare discounting, and we are working hard to control costs. And this year's inflation in non-fuel costs is explained on this entirely by the depreciation associated with our accelerated retirement. And we still expect cost savings and an EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Lower fuel prices continue to benefit earnings, but second quarter earnings would have improved with or without the benefit of lower fuel prices. 
Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and our commitment to return value to shareholders is unchanged, having already returned as much in the first half of 2016 as we did in all of 2015. And of course, we also announced in it's really our intention to launch a $250 million ASR. 
Our capital spending remains in check and are very manageable. And pretax return on invested capital was just phenomenal at 33.5%. As we look ahead to third quarter, we are expecting another quarter of strong margins. And with that overview, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for another fantastic quarter and for their extraordinary efforts over the last 24 hours. 
So Tom, with that, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

The -- we're different than the industry so we don't publish 330 days' worth of inventory. And the other aspect of the -- our competitors' approach is they mostly overschedule so they'll publish more, will claw that back and we just don't use that technique as you know. We don't publish as much inventory and what we do publish, we very much intend to fly. So we rarely go out into a published schedule and make changes. It is easier for us to hold a few flights in reserve and then publish them later as opposed to taking flights out and re-accommodate the customers. So it is a -- I don't know if it's much a philosophy but it is certainly a practice that we've used. The modeling that we've been -- and second, the trends that we are claiming about this morning are very recent. And that's one reason that I mentioned to you all in my opening remarks is that we've seen inconsistent trends over the first 7 months of the year, really going back to December, Tammy, I think of last year. So the -- so we don't know that weeks will make a trend. The bookings right now for the fall look quite good. I wouldn't want you to conclude that, that means that we're predicting positive unit revenue comparisons yet in the fourth quarter. But when I mentioned earlier that I was disappointed, that is our goal. Our goal is to have positive unit revenue growth every single quarter and certainly for this year. We're falling short of that right now for the third quarter and that obviously will give us cause to rethink our plans. The final point is as we have discussed this in recent weeks about the opportunity to reduce the schedule primarily in the fourth quarter, we've not been able to model a scenario where it was profit positive for us to do that. And so this -- in dealing with these incremental capacity choices, we think that actually would be harmful to Southwest in the near term as opposed to helpful. So I think the more productive work effort for us right now on July 21 is to think about our next schedules and what our plans are for 2017. So hopefully, that's responsive to your question."

Business travel, as you know, is very sensitive to the cycle and if that's where you're going with your question. The other tool that we have today to help manage through softer periods is we just have better connect -- we have better connecting capabilities and a lot higher load factors today than we did 20 years ago. So I still think that we're very well positioned for a change in the cycle. I think we're obviously a low-cost producer and have a low fare brand. We have a very loyal band and people do travel during recessions. They just look for more bargains. So generally, that's worked very well in our favor in the past."

I think all the capacity questions that we're getting here today are very appropriate, and that's something that we're going to have to take a very close look at. I agree with Tammy's point earlier.

Now that's mostly weaker revenues that we're seeing here for July, August. There was a question earlier about September. September does look better than July, August, but it's not anything that we're willing to tell you that you can take to the bank at all. So the trend could change. The trend -- we could be overly pessimistic here. It is -- most of the change in the trend, as again, we've attributed it a number of times here today to the close-in bookings. And that is just simply saying we have a lot of competitors out there the week [ph] of travel that offering very hot fares. And we must match to get that traffic. It's just that simple. So that is a change in technique and a change in trend for us. The all-in results is still quite good, still falling -- still, as I said before, just below our goal. The only other thing that I would mention is that there is a consistent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenues going back now all the way to probably the second half of 2014 when we began to see lower fuel prices. So we're off-trend in the third quarter compared to second quarter. And the second quarter is also off-trend compared to where we would expect to be relative to the first quarter. So these are -- not having talked to you a lot personally, we call these sequential trends. You probably use the same term or technique. And that is basically the technique that we are using to arrive at this prediction of down 3% to 4% in the third quarter. So we'll take steps to try to arrest these trends and to get back to positive unit revenue comparisons. And as again as I've said a couple of times, we've got quite a bit of work to do to try to get back there at least here in the near term."

We'll need to evaluate that and see if we need to make some adjustments. I'll remind you that we had some secular opportunities to step up our growth in 2014, 2015. The added capacity that's coming online here this year is very modest. I believe Bob, it's about 2%, so you got the carryover effect of increasing the flying for the Wright Amendment, taking on the flying of the swaps that we acquired for Reagan and LaGuardia, and then launching international service, which was a function of integrating AirTran. And then what is true expansion any way you look at it is launching international services an example out of Houston Hobby. So you have the full year carryover of that from the fourth quarter of last year. So we are, as we've said many times, we peaked in that capacity growth in 2015. We're coming down here in 2016 and now I think we're getting into a point where for 2017, we need to be thoughtful about how fast we grow. The other thing that's going on with our capacity is a fairly significant changing gauge. We're not adding a lot of trips. We're adding more seats than trips because of the up gauging. And then we're getting a little bit more productivity per airplane per day because we're flying a little bit longer, so there's just less time sitting on the ground. So all of those are adding up to more available seat miles than I think really tell the story about our growth. But I don't know that -- again as I've said, we're not shocked that this is where we are. We've been leading the industry consistently with unit revenue performances. And I think is very much justified our growth. We've got record earnings and record returns on capital. So we have a little bit different economic and fare environment you that we're seeing in July.

As I think about the international, that's high risk and truly expansionary. That's real growth. What are wonderful opportunities for us to add capacity remain in the domestic markets with our point-to-point system, either adding frequencies in markets that are selling traffic or alternatively connecting 2 cities with new nonstop service. And as much lower risk than adding a new Caribbean destination -- which is part of the reason that as we look at just taking the fourth quarter as an example, why we don't see a profit positive move that close-in, given that we already have this fixed capacity. We already have the employees, we already got the airplanes. We already got the corporate overhead. It's real hard to justify pulling in the capacity that close-in. So we're much better served to look a little bit further out where we can impact the cost in more variable way and avoid the capacity increases that way. But we have plenty of opportunities to grow the airline. And whether we need to be growing at GDP or something faster, slower or all things, we're going to have to continue to judge.

If I don't think we have a decent -- I don't think we have a reasonable prospect of having positive unit revenues in the third quarter. It probably is difficult to assume that for the fourth quarter, so that doesn't mean we won't make a hearty effort in that regard. But we'll certainly be looking very closely at that for 2017."

As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 p.m. There was a network equipment",504,"Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 p.m. There was a network equipment failure, and the planned redundancy or backup failed as well, and this hindered the recovery efforts and especially with some of our older legacy systems.
Ultimately, the network was virtually fully recovered and restored around 12 hours later, roughly 1 or 2 a.m. this morning. And since then, the operation, and that is airplanes and flight crews and customer re-accommodations, have been working to catch up. I want to apologize to all of our customers that were affected yesterday and today. This is absolutely not the kind of service that our customers expect or what we expect of ourselves. And of course, our 50,000 employees' jobs to serve our customers became significantly more difficult as a result of the computer failure. And I do want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their collective efforts to recover. Those efforts have been truly heroic. So hopefully, after a day of recovery, things will be back to normal tomorrow morning.
Tammy's going to take us through the quarterly results, and I just wanted to point out a couple of highlights. First of all, we had a record performance in many ways, traffic, revenues, load factor, earnings, return on invested capital, with a very strong quarter also in terms of customer service and operations.
Next, we had very solid revenue growth on 4.8% growth in capacity, and that was driving industry leading but modest unit revenue growth of 0.6%, and that was in line with our expectations.
Revenue trends have been up and down all year. Now we're seeing softer fare trends in July, August and notably with close-in bookings, given overall industry revenue and capacity trends that we've been monitoring. None of this is shocking but it is disappointing. 
We're still anticipating strong third quarter margins and profits, strong cash flows and continuing shareholder returns. But we will need to factor these softer trends into our future plans. So for now our second half 2016 plans are unchanged, but we'll continue to look carefully and evaluate our 2017 growth plans.
2017 is going to be an exciting year. We have the 737-8 being launched next year. We've got new technology being deployed next year. We are opening an international terminal in Fort Lauderdale. We've gotten our preliminary approvals to serve 3 cities in Cuba, and we have an outstanding request to add Mexico service to LAX. So a lot of exciting things going on, and certainly, 2017 is going to be a very big year.
I want to thank our people for all their hard work and the tremendous success in driving these results and also congratulate them on another quarter of record profit sharing.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the quarter."

We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million. And excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% year-over-year to a record $757 million, and we grew our earnings per share almost 16% to $1.19. This was a little shy of consensus, but it was right in line with our expectation and the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day.
Our operating margins of over 23% represents a 36-year high performance. And we grew our pretax ROIC, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended June by more than 5 points to 33.5%.
I'd just like to also join Gary in congratulating our outstanding employees on our 13th consecutive quarter of record profit, excluding special items, and their record quarterly profit sharing of $206 million. This brings our profit sharing accrual to $361 million for the first half of the year alone.
Second quarter revenue performance was a significant driver of these strong results. Our operating revenues grew 5.3% and our passenger revenues once again grew to record levels. The growth in our revenues exceeded our capacity growth, resulting in unit revenue growth of 0.6%, which was in line with our guidance. This RASM performance outperformed the industry. And on a stage length adjusted basis, our RASM performance was even better.
Despite the challenging fare environment, our core business was solid, with strong demand for our low fares. Load factors were at record levels throughout the quarter, and we closed second quarter with a record load factor of 85.6%.
Revenues related to Rapid Rewards continue to be very strong. Our second quarter results reflect a net benefit of approximately $135 million related to the amendment of our Chase agreement effective in July last year. Our strong revenue performance was also supported by continued growth in other ancillary revenues.
Corporate sales were also strong, although at softer yields. We continued to benefit from tailwinds from our development markets. And we're very pleased with their performance, especially in light of the challenging fare environment.
International markets continue to perform in line with our expectation, with several of them producing revenue results well above system averages.
Our freight revenues were in line with second quarter of last year.
So to close revenue, we are very pleased with our record operating performance.
So turning to our third quarter revenue outlook. Thus far, traffic and booking trends remain strong, but the fare environment continues to be a challenge. We're seeing heavy discounting of fares, including close-in, which, as we noted in the release, has softened in recent weeks. Based on these trends and our current bookings and including the yield trends, we are expecting third quarter RASM to decline in the 3% to 4% range year-over-year.
And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing benefit from the Chase amendment, and 2Q's approximately $135 million benefit is a reasonable run rate for 3Q. But we won't see the 2- to 3-point year-over-year RASM improvement in future quarters, of course, as we've lapped the July 2015 amendment date. We currently expect third quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from third quarter 2015.
And now I'll move over to our cost performance. Our second quarter costs were right in line with our expectation. Our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased modestly year-over-year largely from lower jet fuel prices. Despite a 4.8% increase in our capacity, our fuel balance only increased 4.1%, reflecting our fuel efficiency gains largely from our fuel modernization effort.
Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 10.4%, the -- to the lower end of our guidance of $1.80 to $1.85. And based on our market prices as of Monday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.05. We're also currently forecasting that level for fourth quarter. This brings our estimate for the full year of 2016 to the $1.90 to $1.95 range, which is down a bit due to the recent drop in market prices. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio beyond third quarter 2016, based on prices as of Monday, is a net liability of approximately $775 million.
And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our second quarter unit costs were also in line with guidance, up approximately 2% year-over-year. This increase is due largely to the acceleration of the depreciation of the Classic fleet, the timing of advertising and technology investments, along with airframe maintenance. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to also increase approximately 2% year-over-year.
Roughly 1 point of that year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirement, with the remainder associated with increased salary, wages and benefits costs from ratified agreements since third quarter 2015 as well as costs associated with technology projects. For full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
And I'm going to move now to our balance sheet and cash flow, and I'll just make a few quick comments regarding the strength of our balance sheet and as well as our cash flows. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. As we reported at Investor Day, we deferred $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx to beyond 2020 as a result of our recently restructured order book with Boeing. Our capital spending remains on track to reach approximately $2 billion this year, with $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx and about $650 million in non-aircraft capital spend.
With operating cash flows of $2.7 billion thus far this year and manageable capital spend, our free cash flow has remained strong, enabling us to continue to return value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
To quickly recap what we discussed at Investor Day last month, we completed our previous $1.5 billion buyback authorization with a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program in May and launched a $500 million ASR under our new $2 billion program, which was authorized by our board back in May. We completed that ASR last month, and we intend to launch another $250 million accelerated share repurchase here soon. Once launched, we have returned $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, and we will have $1.25 billion remaining under our authorization. Our leverage, including off balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range.
And I'll just make a few comments on our fleet, but we have not had any changes to our plans since we announced the restructuring of our order book with Boeing last month at Investor Day. We ended the quarter as planned with 719 aircraft in our fleet and continue to anticipate ending the year with a fleet of 723 aircraft. We are still managing to an average annual net fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 of no more than 2%. And as Gary mentioned, our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range.
While we continue to evaluate our rate of capacity growth beyond 2016, especially in light of the current revenue environment, we still expect annual capacity growth in 2017 and 2018 to be less than this year. We remain disciplined in our approach to growth with a focus, of course, on flexibility to adjust if needed, with a goal to preserve our strong returns and margins.
And now just to quickly recap for you. This was another quarter of record profits, outstanding margins and strong cash flows. Demand for low fares is strong, and we continue to produce record load factors. The revenue yield environment remains challenging with heavy fare discounting, and we are working hard to control costs. And this year's inflation in nonfuel costs is explained on this entirely by the depreciation associated with our accelerated retirement. And we still expect cost savings and an EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Lower fuel prices continue to benefit earnings, but second quarter earnings would have improved with or without the benefit of lower fuel prices.
Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and our commitment to return value to shareholders is unchanged, having already returned as much in the first half of 2016 as we did in all of 2015. And of course, we also announced in this release our intention to launch a $250 million ASR.
Our capital spending remains in check and are very manageable, and pretax return on invested capital was just phenomenal at 33.5%. As we look ahead to third quarter, we are expecting another quarter of strong margins. 
And with that overview, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for another fantastic quarter and for their extraordinary efforts over the last 24 hours.
So Tom, with that, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

The -- we're different than the industry, so we don't publish 330 days' worth of inventory. And the other aspect of the -- our competitors' approach is they mostly over-schedule. So they'll publish more, will claw that back, and we just don't use that technique as you know. We don't publish as much inventory. And what we do publish, we very much intend to fly. So we rarely go out into a published schedule and make changes. It is easier for us to hold a few flights in reserve and then publish them later as opposed to taking flights out and re-accommodating customers. So it is a -- I don't know if it's so much a philosophy, but it is certainly a practice that we've used. The modeling that we've been -- and second, the trends that we are claiming about this morning are very recent. And that's one reason that I mentioned to you all in my opening remarks is that we've seen inconsistent trends over the first 7 months of the year, really going back to December, Tammy, I think of last year. So the -- so we don't know that weeks will make a trend. The bookings right now for the fall look quite good. I wouldn't want you to conclude that, that means that we're predicting positive unit revenue comparisons yet in the fourth quarter. But when I mentioned earlier that I was disappointed, that is our goal. Our goal is to have positive unit revenue growth every single quarter and certainly for this year. We're falling short of that right now for the third quarter, and that obviously will give us a cause to rethink our plans. The final point is as we have discussed this in recent weeks about the opportunity to reduce the schedule primarily in the fourth quarter, we've not been able to model a scenario where it was profit positive for us to do that. And so this -- in dealing with these incremental capacity choices, we think that actually would be harmful to Southwest in the near term as opposed to helpful. So I think the more productive work effort for us right now on July 21 is to think about our next schedules and what our plans are for 2017. So hopefully, that's responsive to your question."

So hopefully, there'll be some opportunities to regain some growth with the cargo business there. So we'll have a number of things that we'll be looking at to try to boost revenues.

That was our goal for the year, and we're falling short of that goal and we can't be happy about that. That's all I was trying to point out. What we are able to do in the meantime, of course, is continue to sustain very strong profits. We're enjoying low fuel prices, and very strong operating margins are our expectation here for the third quarter. I don't have any reason to believe that, that will change in the fourth quarter. But we have initiatives that come online in 2017 that bring with them the opportunity to boost our revenue production. So we're in a period here between now and then where we're just going to have to focus on blocking and tackling: good revenue management, excellent customer service, tweaking our route network to try to use those levers here for the next several quarters. I think all the capacity questions that we're getting here today are very appropriate, and that's something that we're going to have to take a very close look at. I agree with Tammy's point earlier. If that is one of the main levers that we have, we're just not prepared to give any 2017 guidance yet. And of course, just to remind everybody that last year, when we did give guidance well in advance, it was -- I think it was somewhat misunderstood. So we've got some work to do on 2017. We've got the goal to boost unit revenues in 2017 and based on third quarter trends, we've got a lot of work to do."

Now that's mostly weaker revenues that we're seeing here for July, August. There was a question earlier about September. September does look better than July, August, but it's not anything that we're willing to tell you that you can take to the bank at all. So the trend could change. The trend -- we could be overly pessimistic here. It is -- most of the change in the trend, as again, we've attributed it a number of times here today to the close-in bookings. And that is just simply saying that our -- we have a lot of competitors out there the week of travel that are offering very hot fares, and we must match to get that traffic. It's just that simple. So that is a change in technique and a change in trend for us. The all-in results is still quite good, still falling -- still, as I said before is just below our goal. The only other thing that I would mention is that there is a consistent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenues going back now all the way to probably the second half of 2014 when we began to see lower fuel prices. So we're off-trend in the third quarter compared to second quarter. And the second quarter is also off-trend compared to where we would expect to be relative to the first quarter. So these are -- not having talked to you a lot personally, we call these sequential trends. You probably use the same term or technique. And that is basically the technique that we are using to arrive at this prediction of down 3% to 4% in the third quarter. So we'll take steps to try to arrest these trends and to get back to positive unit revenue comparisons. And as -- again as I've said a couple of times, we've got quite a bit of work to do to try to get back there, at least here in the near term."

We'll need to evaluate that and see if we need to make some adjustments. I'll remind you that we had some secular opportunities to step up our growth in 2014, 2015. The added capacity that's coming online here this year is very modest. I believe, Bob, it's about 2%, so you got the carryover effect of increasing the flying for the Wright Amendment, taking on the flying of the slots that we acquired for Reagan and LaGuardia, and then launching international service, which was a function of integrating AirTran. And then what is true expansion any way you look at it is launching international service as an example out of Houston Hobby. So you have the full year carryover of that from the fourth quarter of last year. So we are, as we've said many times, we peaked in that capacity growth in 2015. We're coming down here in 2016 and now I think we're getting into a point where, for 2017, we need to be thoughtful about how fast we grow. The other thing that's going on with our capacity is a fairly significant changing gauge. We're not adding a lot of trips. We're adding more seats than trips because of the up gauging. And then we're getting a little bit more productivity per airplane per day, because we're flying a little bit longer, so there's just less time sitting on the ground. So all of those are adding up to more available seat miles than I think really tell the story about our growth. But I don't know that -- again, as I've said, we're not shocked that this is where we are. We've been leading the industry consistently with unit revenue performances, and I think is very much justified our growth. We've got record earnings and record returns on capital. So we have a little bit different economic and fare environment here that we're seeing in July. And again, we're going to react to that and stay tuned."

As I think about the international, that's high risk and truly expansionary. That's real growth. What are wonderful opportunities for us to add capacity remain in the domestic markets with our point-to-point system, either adding frequencies in markets that are spilling traffic or alternatively connecting 2 cities with new nonstop service. And as much lower risk than adding a new Caribbean destination and which -- and that was part of the reason that as we look at, just taking the fourth quarter as an example, why we don't see a profit positive move that close-in, given that we already have this fixed capacity. We already have the employees. We already got the airplanes. We already got the corporate overhead. It's real hard to justify pulling in the capacity that close-in. So we're much better served to look a little bit further out where we can impact the cost in more variable way and avoid the capacity increases that way. But we have plenty of opportunities to grow the airline. And whether we need to be growing at GDP or something faster or slower or all things, we're going to have to continue to judge.

And -- but I would -- I appreciate the question, but the premise I would push back on, I think that certainly more than any other airline, and I put us in there with top-notch industrials. We have done a very fine job of trying to balance the needs of all of our constituents. And we're taking very good care of our shareholders, and it's interesting that you described the current period as a time of crisis when in the first half of this year, I believe we've had all-time record shareholder returns in 6 months. So if that's a crisis, I'll take it. But the notion that we put one over the other is an unfair characterization. We must have good employees. We must take good care of the employees. We have a very intensive business, and we truly care about people. We care about our people, and we -- and then in turn we care about our customers. And it is a virtuous cycle. And to think that you can simply ignore that and say we're only going to focus on the shareholders doesn't work. It's not sustainable. But we're famous for telling everyone and admitting that's who we are, and we're just not going to apologize for that. It's work. This is the most successful airline in history that is now turning out record earnings. And so we want to sustain that. We want to sustain the returns for our shareholders, and the best way to do that is to continue to take very good care of our people."

As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 p.m. There was a network equipment failure, and the planned redundancy or backup failed as well, and this hindered the recovery efforts and especially with some of our older legacy systems.
Ultimately, the network was virtually fully recovered and restored around 12 hours later, roughly 1 or 2 a.m. this morning. And since then, the operation, and that is airplanes and flight crews and customer re-accommodations, have been working to catch up. I want to apologize to all of our customers that were affected yesterday and today. This is absolutely not the kind of service that our customers expect or what we expect of ourselves. And of course, our 50,000 employees' jobs to serve our customers became significantly more difficult as a result of the computer failure. And I do want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their collective efforts to recover. Those efforts have been truly heroic. So hopefully, after a day of recovery, things will be back to normal tomorrow morning.
Tammy's going to take us through the quarterly results, and I just wanted to point out a couple of highlights. First of all, we had a record performance in many ways, traffic, revenues, load factor, earnings, return on invested capital, with a very strong quarter also in terms of customer service and operations.
Next, we had very solid revenue growth on 4.8% growth in capacity, and that was driving industry leading but modest unit revenue growth of 0.6%, and that was in line with our expectations.
Revenue trends have been up and down all year. Now we're seeing softer fare trends in July, August and notably with close-in bookings, given overall industry revenue and capacity trends that we've been monitoring. None of this is shocking but it is disappointing. 
We're still anticipating strong third quarter margins and profits, strong cash flows and continuing shareholder returns. But we will need to factor these softer trends into our future plans. So for now our second half 2016 plans are unchanged, but we'll continue to look carefully and evaluate our 2017 growth plans.
2017 is going to be an exciting year. We have the 737-8 being launched next year. We've got new technology being deployed next year. We are opening an international terminal in Fort Lauderdale. We've gotten our preliminary approvals to serve 3 cities in Cuba, and we have an outstanding request to add Mexico service to LAX. So a lot of exciting things going on, and certainly, 2017 is going to be a very big year.
I want to thank our people for all their hard work and the tremendous success in driving these results and also congratulate them on another quarter of record profit sharing.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the quarter."

We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million. And excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% ye",1513,"Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million. And excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% year-over-year to a record $757 million, and we grew our earnings per share almost 16% to $1.19. This was a little shy of consensus, but it was right in line with our expectation and the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day.
Our operating margins of over 23% represents a 36-year high performance. And we grew our pretax ROIC, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended June by more than 5 points to 33.5%.
I'd just like to also join Gary in congratulating our outstanding employees on our 13th consecutive quarter of record profit, excluding special items, and their record quarterly profit sharing of $206 million. This brings our profit sharing accrual to $361 million for the first half of the year alone.
Second quarter revenue performance was a significant driver of these strong results. Our operating revenues grew 5.3% and our passenger revenues once again grew to record levels. The growth in our revenues exceeded our capacity growth, resulting in unit revenue growth of 0.6%, which was in line with our guidance. This RASM performance outperformed the industry. And on a stage length adjusted basis, our RASM performance was even better.
Despite the challenging fare environment, our core business was solid, with strong demand for our low fares. Load factors were at record levels throughout the quarter, and we closed second quarter with a record load factor of 85.6%.
Revenues related to Rapid Rewards continue to be very strong. Our second quarter results reflect a net benefit of approximately $135 million related to the amendment of our Chase agreement effective in July last year. Our strong revenue performance was also supported by continued growth in other ancillary revenues.
Corporate sales were also strong, although at softer yields. We continued to benefit from tailwinds from our development markets. And we're very pleased with their performance, especially in light of the challenging fare environment.
International markets continue to perform in line with our expectations, with several of them producing revenue results well above system averages.
Our freight revenues were in line with second quarter of last year.
So to close revenue, we are very pleased with our record operating performance.
So turning to our third quarter revenue outlook. Thus far, traffic and booking trends remain strong, but the fare environment continues to be a challenge. We're seeing a heavy discounting of fares, including close-in, which, as we noted in the release, has softened in recent weeks. Based on these trends and our current bookings and including the yield trends, we are expecting third quarter RASM to decline in the 3% to 4% range year-over-year.
And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing benefit from the Chase amendment, and 2Q's approximately $135 million benefit is a reasonable run rate for 3Q. But we won't see the 2- to 3-point year-over-year RASM improvement in future quarters, of course, as we've lapped the July 2015 amendment date. We currently expect third quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from third quarter 2015.
And now I'll move over to our cost performance. Our second quarter costs were right in line with our expectation. Our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased modestly year-over-year largely from lower jet fuel prices. Despite a 4.8% increase in our capacity, our fuel balance only increased 4.1%, reflecting our fuel efficiency gains largely from our fuel modernization effort.
Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 10.4%, the -- to the lower end of our guidance of $1.80 to $1.85. And based on our market prices as of Monday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.05. We're also currently forecasting that level for fourth quarter. This brings our estimate for the full year of 2016 to the $1.90 to $1.95 range, which is down a bit due to the recent drop in market prices. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio beyond third quarter 2016, based on prices as of Monday, is a net liability of approximately $775 million.
And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our second quarter unit costs were also in line with guidance, up approximately 2% year-over-year. This increase is due largely to the acceleration of the depreciation of the Classic fleet, the timing of advertising and technology investments, along with airframe maintenance. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to also increase approximately 2% year-over-year.
Roughly 1 point of that year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirement, with the remainder associated with increased salary, wages and benefits costs from ratified agreements since third quarter 2015 as well as costs associated with technology projects. For full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
And I'm going to move now to our balance sheet and cash flow, and I'll just make a few quick comments regarding the strength of our balance sheet and as well as our cash flows. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. As we reported at Investor Day, we deferred $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx to beyond 2020 as a result of our recently restructured order book with Boeing. Our capital spending remains on track to reach approximately $2 billion this year, with $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx and about $650 million in non-aircraft capital spend.
With operating cash flows of $2.7 billion thus far this year and manageable capital spend, our free cash flow has remained strong, enabling us to continue to return value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
To quickly recap what we discussed at Investor Day last month, we completed our previous $1.5 billion buyback authorization with a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program in May and launched a $500 million ASR under our new $2 billion program, which was authorized by our board back in May. We completed that ASR last month, and we intend to launch another $250 million accelerated share repurchase here soon. Once launched, we have returned $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, and we will have $1.25 billion remaining under our authorization. Our leverage, including off balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range.
And I'll just make a few comments on our fleet, but we have not had any changes to our plans since we announced the restructuring of our order book with Boeing last month at Investor Day. We ended the quarter as planned with 719 aircraft in our fleet and continue to anticipate ending the year with a fleet of 723 aircraft. We are still managing to an average annual net fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 of no more than 2%. And as Gary mentioned, our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range.
While we continue to evaluate our rate of capacity growth beyond 2016, especially in light of the current revenue environment, we still expect annual capacity growth in 2017 and 2018 to be less than this year. We remain disciplined in our approach to growth with a focus, of course, on flexibility to adjust if needed, with a goal to preserve our strong returns and margins.
And now just to quickly recap for you. This was another quarter of record profits, outstanding margins and strong cash flows. Demand for low fares is strong, and we continue to produce record load factors. The revenue yield environment remains challenging with heavy fare discounting, and we are working hard to control costs. And this year's inflation in nonfuel costs is explained on almost entirely by the depreciation associated with our accelerated retirement. And we still expect cost savings and an EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Lower fuel prices continue to benefit earnings, but second quarter earnings would have improved with or without the benefit of lower fuel prices.
Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and our commitment to return value to shareholders is unchanged, having already returned as much in the first half of 2016 as we did in all of 2015. And of course, we also announced in this release our intention to launch a $250 million ASR.
Our capital spending remains in check and are very manageable, and pretax return on invested capital was just phenomenal at 33.5%. As we look ahead to third quarter, we are expecting another quarter of strong margins. 
And with that overview, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for another fantastic quarter and for their extraordinary efforts over the last 24 hours.
So Tom, with that, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

But when I look at sort of the guidance for the latter part of 2016, I think fuel's going to be up year-over-year, CASM is going to be up and it also looks like RASM could be down a bit. Why no change or move away from the 5% to 6% growth for this year? I mean, is it a systems issue that you can't change the schedule for the latter part of '16? Or what's holding you up or maybe preventing that? Any color, your thoughts on that would be great."

The -- we're different than the industry, so we don't publish 330 days' worth of inventory. And the other aspect of the -- our competitors' approach is they mostly over-schedule. So they'll publish more, they'll claw that back, and we just don't use that technique as you know. We don't publish as much inventory. And what we do publish, we very much intend to fly. So we rarely go out into a published schedule and make changes. It is easier for us to hold a few flights in reserve and then publish them later as opposed to taking flights out and re-accommodating customers. So it is a -- I don't know if it's so much a philosophy, but it is certainly a practice that we've used. The modeling that we've been -- and second, the trends that we are claiming about this morning are very recent. And that's one reason that I mentioned to you all in my opening remarks is that we've seen inconsistent trends over the first 7 months of the year, really going back to December, Tammy, I think of last year. So the -- so we don't know that weeks will make a trend. The bookings right now for the fall look quite good. I wouldn't want you to conclude that, that means that we're predicting positive unit revenue comparisons yet in the fourth quarter. But when I mentioned earlier that I was disappointed, that is our goal. Our goal is to have positive unit revenue growth every single quarter and certainly for this year. We're falling short of that right now for the third quarter, and that obviously will give us a cause to rethink our plans. The final point is as we have discussed this in recent weeks about the opportunity to reduce the schedule primarily in the fourth quarter, we've not been able to model a scenario where it was profit positive for us to do that. And so this -- in dealing with these incremental capacity choices, we think that actually would be harmful to Southwest in the near term as opposed to helpful. So I think the more productive work effort for us right now on July 21 is to think about our next schedules and what our plans are for 2017. So hopefully, that's responsive to your question."

And the nice thing is we're seeing -- in terms of more positives, we're seeing good strength with our corporate sales, very nice growth there. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to grow very nicely. And those are sort of outside of the ""fare environment."" And then our ancillary products continue to grow, and that's primarily EarlyBird and the upgraded boarding product. So we have a couple of tools. And I guess, the other thought was that freight was relatively soft in the second quarter. So hopefully, there'll be some opportunities to regain some growth with the cargo business there. So we'll have a number of things that we'll be looking at to try to boost revenues. But certainly, as time goes by here this year, the tailwind of the developing markets, I agree with Tammy, it's going to continue to wane. But we have some. We're 4% in development this year.

And I think what a lot of people misunderstood back in the '90s is how much business travel we had, and some of that, again, was very natural with the short-haul orientation we had with high frequencies. Those were convenient schedules that were built for business customers. So I don't -- if anything, I'll bet you that we're less reliant on business customers today than we were 20 years ago. Business travel, as you know, is very sensitive to the cycle, and -- if that's where you're going with your question. The other tool that we have today to help manage through softer periods is we just have better connect -- we have better connecting capabilities and a lot higher load factors today than we did 20 years ago. So no, I still think that we're very well positioned for a change in the cycle. I think we're obviously a low-cost producer and have a low fare brand. We have a very loyal brand, and people do travel during recessions. They just look for more bargains. So generally, that's worked very well in our favor in the past."

That was our goal for the year, and we're falling short of that goal and we can't be happy about that. That's all I was trying to point out. What we are able to do in the meantime, of course, is continue to sustain very strong profits. We're enjoying low fuel prices, and very strong operating margins are our expectation here for the third quarter. I don't have any reason to believe that, that will change in the fourth quarter. But we have initiatives that come online in 2017 that bring with them the opportunity to boost our revenue production. So we're in a period here between now and then where we're just going to have to focus on blocking and tackling: good revenue management, excellent customer service, tweaking our route network to try to use those levers here for the next several quarters. I think all the capacity questions that we're getting here today are very appropriate, and that's something that we're going to have to take a very close look at. I agree with Tammy's point earlier. If that is one of the main levers that we have, we're just not prepared to give any 2017 guidance yet. And of course, I'll just remind everybody that last year, when we did give guidance well in advance, it was -- I think it was somewhat misunderstood. So we've got some work to do

Now that's mostly weaker revenues that we're seeing here for July, August. There was a question earlier about September. September does look better than July, August, but it's not anything that we're willing to tell you that you can take to the bank at all. So the trend could change. The trend -- we could be overly pessimistic here. It is -- most of the change in the trend, as again, we've attributed it a number of times here today to the close-in bookings. And that is just simply saying that our -- we have a lot of competitors out there the week [ph] of travel that are offering very hot fares, and we must match to get that traffic. It's just that simple. So that is a change in technique and a change in trend for us. The all-in result is still quite good, still falling -- still, as I said before is just below our goal. The only other thing that I would mention is that there is a consistent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenues going back now all the way to probably the second half of 2014 when we began to see lower fuel prices. So we're off-trend in the third quarter compared to second quarter. And the second quarter is also off-trend compared to where we would expect to be relative to the first quarter. So these are -- not having talked to you a lot personally, we call these sequential trends. You probably use the same term or technique. And that is basically the technique that we are using to arrive at this prediction of down 3% to 4% in the third quarter. So we'll take steps to try to arrest these trends and to get back to positive unit revenue comparisons. And as -- again as I've said a couple of times, we've got quite a bit of work to do to try to get back there, at least here in the near term."

And then what is true expansion any way you look at it is launching international service as an example out of Houston Hobby.

The other thing that's going on with our capacity is a fairly significant changing gauge. We're not adding a lot of trips. We're adding more seats than trips because of the up gauging. And then we're getting a little bit more productivity per airplane per day, because we're flying a little bit longer, so there's just less time sitting on the ground. So all of those are adding up to more available seat miles than I think really tell the story about our growth. But I don't know that -- again, as I've said, we're not shocked that this is where we are. We've been leading the industry consistently with unit revenue performances, and I think has very much justified our growth. We've got record earnings and record returns on capital. So we have a little bit different economic and fare environment here that we're seeing in July. And again, we're going to react to that and stay tuned."

And that because as I think about it, you're already retiring your Classic fleet, and if I remember correctly from the Investor Day, I don't think you have many retirements until 2023. So just what's the flexibility over the next few years to really kind of flex up or flex down capacity plans? Is it -- or is it just a mix between domestic and international?"

As I think about the international, that's higher risk and truly expansionary. That's real growth. What are wonderful opportunities for us to add capacity remain in the domestic markets with our point-to-point system, either adding frequencies in markets that are spilling traffic or alternatively connecting 2 cities with new nonstop service. And as much lower risk than adding a new Caribbean destination and which -- and that was part of the reason that as we look at, just taking the fourth quarter as an example, why we don't see a profit positive move that close-in, given that we already have this fixed capacity. We already have the employees. We already got the airplanes. We already got the corporate overhead. It's real hard to justify pulling in the capacity that close-in. So we're much better served to look a little bit further out where we can impact the cost in more variable way and avoid the capacity increases that way. But we have plenty of opportunities to grow the airline. And whether we need to be growing at GDP or something faster or slower or all things, we're going to have to continue to judge. And I'm just not ready to give you an answer today."

So if that's a crisis, I'll take it. But the notion that we put one over the other is an unfair characterization. We must have good employees. We must take good care of the employees. We have a very intensive business, and we truly care about people. We care about our people, and we -- and then in turn we care about our customers. And it is a virtuous cycle. And to think that you can simply ignore that and say we're only going to focus on the shareholders doesn't work. It's not sustainable. But we're famous for telling everyone and admitting that's who we are, and we're just not going to apologize for that. It's worked. This is the most successful airline in history that is now turning out record earnings. And so we want to sustain that. We want to sustain the returns for our shareholders, and the best way to do that is to continue to take very good care of our people."

As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 p.m. There was a network equipment failure, and the planned redundancy or backup failed as well, and this hindered the recovery efforts and especially with some of our older legacy systems.
Ultimately, the network was virtually fully recovered and restored around 12 hours later, roughly 1 or 2 a.m. this morning. And since then, the operation, and that is airplanes and flight crews and customer re-accommodations, have been working to catch up. I want to apologize to all of our customers that were affected yesterday and today. This is absolutely not the kind of service that our customers expect or what we expect of ourselves. And of course, our 50,000 employees' jobs to serve our customers became significantly more difficult as a result of the computer failure. And I do want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their collective efforts to recover. Those efforts have been truly heroic. So hopefully, after a day of recovery, things will be back to normal tomorrow morning.
Tammy's going to take us through the quarterly results, and I just wanted to point out a couple of highlights. First of all, we had a record performance in many ways, traffic, revenues, load factor, earnings, return on invested capital, with a very strong quarter also in terms of customer service and operations.
Next, we had very solid revenue growth on 4.8% growth in capacity, and that was driving industry leading but modest unit revenue growth of 0.6%, and that was in line with our expectations.
Revenue trends have been up and down all year. Now we're seeing softer fare trends in July, August and notably with close-in bookings, given overall industry revenue and capacity trends that we've been monitoring. None of this is shocking but it is disappointing. 
We're still anticipating strong third quarter margins and profits, strong cash flows and continuing shareholder returns. But we will need to factor these softer trends into our future plans. So for now our second half 2016 plans are unchanged, but we'll continue to look carefully and evaluate our 2017 growth plans.
2017 is going to be an exciting year. We have the 737-8 being launched next year. We've got new technology being deployed next year. We are opening an international terminal in Fort Lauderdale. We've gotten our preliminary approvals to serve 3 cities in Cuba, and we have an outstanding request to add Mexico service to LAX. So a lot of exciting things going on, and certainly, 2017 is going to be a very big year.
I want to thank our people for all their hard work and the tremendous success in driving these results and also congratulate them on another quarter of record profit sharing.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the quarter."

We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million. And excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% ye",1513,"Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million. And excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% year-over-year to a record $757 million, and we grew our earnings per share almost 16% to $1.19. This was a little shy of consensus, but it was right in line with our expectation and the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day.
Our operating margins of over 23% represents a 36-year high performance. And we grew our pretax ROIC, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended June by more than 5 points to 33.5%.
I'd just like to also join Gary in congratulating our outstanding employees on our 13th consecutive quarter of record profit, excluding special items, and their record quarterly profit sharing of $206 million. This brings our profit sharing accrual to $361 million for the first half of the year alone.
Second quarter revenue performance was a significant driver of these strong results. Our operating revenues grew 5.3% and our passenger revenues once again grew to record levels. The growth in our revenues exceeded our capacity growth, resulting in unit revenue growth of 0.6%, which was in line with our guidance. This RASM performance outperformed the industry. And on a stage length adjusted basis, our RASM performance was even better.
Despite the challenging fare environment, our core business was solid, with strong demand for our low fares. Load factors were at record levels throughout the quarter, and we closed second quarter with a record load factor of 85.6%.
Revenues related to Rapid Rewards continue to be very strong. Our second quarter results reflect a net benefit of approximately $135 million related to the amendment of our Chase agreement effective in July last year. Our strong revenue performance was also supported by continued growth in other ancillary revenues.
Corporate sales were also strong, although at softer yields. We continued to benefit from tailwinds from our development markets. And we're very pleased with their performance, especially in light of the challenging fare environment.
International markets continue to perform in line with our expectations, with several of them producing revenue results well above system averages.
Our freight revenues were in line with second quarter of last year.
So to close revenue, we are very pleased with our record operating performance.
So turning to our third quarter revenue outlook. Thus far, traffic and booking trends remain strong, but the fare environment continues to be a challenge. We're seeing a heavy discounting of fares, including close-in, which, as we noted in the release, has softened in recent weeks. Based on these trends and our current bookings and including the yield trends, we are expecting third quarter RASM to decline in the 3% to 4% range year-over-year.
And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing benefit from the Chase amendment, and 2Q's approximately $135 million benefit is a reasonable run rate for 3Q. But we won't see the 2- to 3-point year-over-year RASM improvement in future quarters, of course, as we've lapped the July 2015 amendment date. We currently expect third quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from third quarter 2015.
And now I'll move over to our cost performance. Our second quarter costs were right in line with our expectation. Our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased modestly year-over-year largely from lower jet fuel prices. Despite a 4.8% increase in our capacity, our fuel balance only increased 4.1%, reflecting our fuel efficiency gains largely from our fuel modernization effort.
Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 10.4%, the -- to the lower end of our guidance of $1.80 to $1.85. And based on our market prices as of Monday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.05. We're also currently forecasting that level for fourth quarter. This brings our estimate for the full year of 2016 to the $1.90 to $1.95 range, which is down a bit due to the recent drop in market prices. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio beyond third quarter 2016, based on prices as of Monday, is a net liability of approximately $775 million.
And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our second quarter unit costs were also in line with guidance, up approximately 2% year-over-year. This increase is due largely to the acceleration of the depreciation of the Classic fleet, the timing of advertising and technology investments, along with airframe maintenance. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to also increase approximately 2% year-over-year.
Roughly 1 point of that year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirement, with the remainder associated with increased salary, wages and benefits costs from ratified agreements since third quarter 2015 as well as costs associated with technology projects. For full year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.
And I'm going to move now to our balance sheet and cash flow, and I'll just make a few quick comments regarding the strength of our balance sheet and as well as our cash flows. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. As we reported at Investor Day, we deferred $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx to beyond 2020 as a result of our recently restructured order book with Boeing. Our capital spending remains on track to reach approximately $2 billion this year, with $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx and about $650 million in non-aircraft capital spend.
With operating cash flows of $2.7 billion thus far this year and manageable capital spend, our free cash flow has remained strong, enabling us to continue to return value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
To quickly recap what we discussed at Investor Day last month, we completed our previous $1.5 billion buyback authorization with a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program in May and launched a $500 million ASR under our new $2 billion program, which was authorized by our board back in May. We completed that ASR last month, and we intend to launch another $250 million accelerated share repurchase here soon. Once launched, we have returned $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, and we will have $1.25 billion remaining under our authorization. Our leverage, including off balance sheet aircraft leases, remains in the low to mid-30% range.
And I'll just make a few comments on our fleet, but we have not had any changes to our plans since we announced the restructuring of our order book with Boeing last month at Investor Day. We ended the quarter as planned with 719 aircraft in our fleet and continue to anticipate ending the year with a fleet of 723 aircraft. We are still managing to an average annual net fleet growth for the 3 years ended 2018 of no more than 2%. And as Gary mentioned, our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range.
While we continue to evaluate our rate of capacity growth beyond 2016, especially in light of the current revenue environment, we still expect annual capacity growth in 2017 and 2018 to be less than this year. We remain disciplined in our approach to growth with a focus, of course, on flexibility to adjust if needed, with a goal to preserve our strong returns and margins.
And now just to quickly recap for you. This was another quarter of record profits, outstanding margins and strong cash flows. Demand for low fares is strong, and we continue to produce record load factors. The revenue yield environment remains challenging with heavy fare discounting, and we are working hard to control costs. And this year's inflation in nonfuel costs is explained on almost entirely by the depreciation associated with our accelerated retirement. And we still expect cost savings and an EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Lower fuel prices continue to benefit earnings, but second quarter earnings would have improved with or without the benefit of lower fuel prices.
Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and our commitment to return value to shareholders is unchanged, having already returned as much in the first half of 2016 as we did in all of 2015. And of course, we also announced in this release our intention to launch a $250 million ASR.
Our capital spending remains in check and are very manageable, and pretax return on invested capital was just phenomenal at 33.5%. As we look ahead to third quarter, we are expecting another quarter of strong margins. 
And with that overview, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for another fantastic quarter and for their extraordinary efforts over the last 24 hours.
So Tom, with that, we'd be happy to open it up for questions now."

The -- we're different than the industry, so we don't publish 330 days' worth of inventory. And the other aspect of the -- our competitors' approach is they mostly over-schedule. So they'll publish more, they'll claw that back, and we just don't use that technique as you know. We don't publish as much inventory. And what we do publish, we very much intend to fly. So we rarely go out into a published schedule and make changes. It is easier for us to hold a few flights in reserve and then publish them later as opposed to taking flights out and re-accommodating customers. So it is a -- I don't know if it's so much a philosophy, but it is certainly a practice that we've used. The modeling that we've been -- and second, the trends that we are claiming about this morning are very recent. And that's one reason that I mentioned to you all in my opening remarks is that we've seen inconsistent trends over the first 7 months of the year, really going back to December, Tammy, I think of last year. So the -- so we don't know that weeks will make a trend. The bookings right now for the fall look quite good. I wouldn't want you to conclude that, that means that we're predicting positive unit revenue comparisons yet in the fourth quarter. But when I mentioned earlier that I was disappointed, that is our goal. Our goal is to have positive unit revenue growth every single quarter and certainly for this year. We're falling short of that right now for the third quarter, and that obviously will give us a cause to rethink our plans. The final point is as we have discussed this in recent weeks about the opportunity to reduce the schedule primarily in the fourth quarter, we've not been able to model a scenario where it was profit positive for us to do that. And so this -- in dealing with these incremental capacity choices, we think that actually would be harmful to Southwest in the near term as opposed to helpful. So I think the more productive work effort for us right now on July 21 is to think about our next schedules and what our plans are for 2017. So hopefully, that's responsive to your question."

And the nice thing is we're seeing -- in terms of more positives, we're seeing good strength with our corporate sales, very nice growth there. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to grow very nicely. And those are sort of outside of the ""fare environment."" And then our ancillary products continue to grow, and that's primarily EarlyBird and the upgraded boarding product. So we have a couple of tools. And I guess, the other thought was that freight was relatively soft in the second quarter. So hopefully, there'll be some opportunities to regain some growth with the cargo business there. So we'll have a number of things that we'll be looking at to try to boost revenues. But certainly, as time goes by here this year, the tailwind of the developing markets, I agree with Tammy, it's going to continue to wane. But we have some. We're 4% in development this year.

Business travel, as you know, is very sensitive to the cycle, and -- if that's where you're going with your question. The other tool that we have today to help manage through softer periods is we just have better connect -- we have better connecting capabilities and a lot higher load factors today than we did 20 years ago.

We're enjoying low fuel prices, and very strong operating margins are our expectation here for the third quarter. I don't have any reason to believe that, that will change in the fourth quarter. But we have initiatives that come online in 2017 that bring with them the opportunity to boost our revenue production. So we're in a period here between now and then where we're just going to have to focus on blocking and tackling: good revenue management, excellent customer service, tweaking our route network to try to use those levers here for the next several quarters. I think all the capacity questions that we're getting here today are very appropriate, and that's something that we're going to have to take a very close look at. I agree with Tammy's point earlier. If that is one of the main levers that we have, we're just not prepared to give any 2017 guidance yet.

Now that's mostly weaker revenues that we're seeing here for July, August. There was a question earlier about September. September does look better than July, August, but it's not anything that we're willing to tell you that you can take to the bank at all. So the trend could change. The trend -- we could be overly pessimistic here. It is -- most of the change in the trend, as again, we've attributed it a number of times here today to the close-in bookings. And that is just simply saying that our -- we have a lot of competitors out there the week [ph] of travel that are offering very hot fares, and we must match to get that traffic. It's just that simple. So that is a change in technique and a change in trend for us. The all-in result is still quite good, still falling -- still, as I said before is just below our goal. The only other thing that I would mention is that there is a consistent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenues going back now all the way to probably the second half of 2014 when we began to see lower fuel prices. So we're off-trend in the third quarter compared to second quarter. And the second quarter is also off-trend compared to where we would expect to be relative to the first quarter. So these are -- not having talked to you a lot personally, we call these sequential trends. You probably use the same term or technique. And that is basically the technique that we are using to arrive at this prediction of down 3% to 4% in the third quarter. So we'll take steps to try to arrest these trends and to get back to positive unit revenue comparisons. And as -- again as I've said a couple of times, we've got quite a bit of work to do to try to get back there, at least here in the near term."

And DOJ will, of course, complain about illegal price collusion or collusion of capacity levels, but there is also the opportunity, it seems, for some legal coordination, so to speak, on capacity levels and on pricing in the industry. And your comments suggest to me that you're perhaps resistive to playing that game. And I guess, I just wonder with Southwest having grown to be as large a player as it is in the industry today, isn't it kind of required that overall, the industry is healthy in order for Southwest to be healthy?"

And what I was wondering is what you are hoping to see when you're growing supply like 3x faster than GDP. So I'm just wondering what the expectation was. And just -- if this is just not from a Southwest perspective where you were just adjusting to a new lower fuel price environment or why you'll be surprised if you're growing so much faster than GDP, and then Southwest isn't moderating capacity, I think, most of your competitors showed moderating capacity into the end of the year, what the expectation was?"

We'll need to evaluate that and see if we need to make some adjustments. I'll remind you that we had some secular opportunities to step up our growth in 2014, 2015. The added capacity that's coming online here this year is very modest. I believe, Bob, it's about 2%, so you got the carryover effect of increasing the flying for the Wright Amendment, taking on the flying of the slots that we acquired for Reagan and LaGuardia, and then launching international service, which was a function of integrating AirTran. And then what is true expansion any way you look at it is launching international service as an example out of Houston Hobby. So you have the full year carryover of that from the fourth quarter of last year. So we are, as we've said many times, we peaked in that capacity growth in 2015. We're coming down here in 2016 and now I think we're getting into a point where, for 2017, we need to be thoughtful about how fast we grow. The other thing that's going on with our capacity is a fairly significant changing gauge. We're not adding a lot of trips. We're adding more seats than trips because of the up gauging. And then we're getting a little bit more productivity per airplane per day, because we're flying a little bit longer, so there's just less time sitting on the ground. So all of those are adding up to more available seat miles than I think really tell the story about our growth. But I don't know that -- again, as I've said, we're not shocked that this is where we are. We've been leading the industry consistently with unit revenue performances, and I think has very much justified our growth. We've got record earnings and record returns on capital. So we have a little bit different economic and fare environment here that we're seeing in July. And again, we're going to react to that and stay tuned."

And that because as I think about it, you're already retiring your Classic fleet, and if I remember correctly from the Investor Day, I don't think you have many retirements until 2023. So just what's the flexibility over the next few years to really kind of flex up or flex down capacity plans? Is it -- or is it just a mix between domestic and international?"

As I think about the international, that's higher risk and truly expansionary. That's real growth. What are wonderful opportunities for us to add capacity remain in the domestic markets with our point-to-point system, either adding frequencies in markets that are spilling traffic or alternatively connecting 2 cities with new nonstop service. And as much lower risk than adding a new Caribbean destination and which -- and that was part of the reason that as we look at, just taking the fourth quarter as an example, why we don't see a profit positive move that close-in, given that we already have this fixed capacity. We already have the employees. We already got the airplanes. We already got the corporate overhead. It's real hard to justify pulling in the capacity that close-in. So we're much better served to look a little bit further out where we can impact the cost in more variable way and avoid the capacity increases that way. But we have plenty of opportunities to grow the airline. And whether we need to be growing at GDP or something faster or slower or all things, we're going to have to continue to judge. And I'm just not ready to give you an answer today."

We have a very intensive business, and we truly care about people. We care about our people, and we -- and then in turn we care about our customers. And it is a virtuous cycle.

31726,307595936,1061846,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year-ago level",700,"Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year-ago levels by $0.01. We generated strong free cash flow of almost $400 million for the quarter and returned $312 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
RASM performed exactly in line with our expectation, and again that's taking into account the negative impact of 0.5 point that we had from the  technology outage. We have consistently outperformed the domestic industry for 2015 and for the first part of 2016. Along with the lapse of the year-over-year gains at our 2015 Chase deal, we've got harder comparisons in the near term. Even with the outperformance though, we've seen weakening sequential trends for a number of quarters now. But that feels like that's coming to an end, taking into account the timing of the holidays in September November and December January time period, the monthly and quarterly sequential trends look good to us. They look like they are stabilizing. I would quickly add, it's a little too early to tell if they are improving, although close in bookings and yields are improved. 
As compared to some of the guidance that I've heard from our competitors, there seems to be a difference between the expectations surrounding the December, January holiday time period. But it's our guess at this point, consistent with what we saw calendar-wise in 2011, that that might be as high as 1.5 points. We take that into account and again, our trends between third quarter and fourth quarter look very comparable and maybe even better.
A couple of very encouraging signs, first of all, the percent of new markets are developing markets are roughly at historic levels for us, down very significantly from where we were in 2014 and '15. This will continue and perhaps fall further in 2017 as we slow our domestic growth to roughly 2%. And of course, this bodes well for our unit revenue outlook. The domestic industry is growing seat miles well ahead of GDP growth. And we've seen significant competitive capacity adds in markets that we serve. And it's increased competition that's diluting revenue on routes that we serve, that accounts for the decline in unit revenue trends and especially here in 2016. 
We're planning for rising costs in 2017, and that is due to higher jet fuel prices and labor rates. Our goal is to arrest the trend of declining unit revenues in 2017 and achieve positive unit revenue comparisons for the year as compared to 2016. We'll rely primarily on basic revenue management and route design techniques to achieve that. And we're leaning heavily on our fleet modernization in the near term to help mitigate our unit cost pressures.
In the meantime, and as we anticipated again in 2017 -- for 2017, profits, cash flow, internal investments and shareholder returns are all strong. We achieved a 32.3% ROIC pretax for the 12 months ended September 30 and we'll be close to 30% for the year 2016. So I anticipate another very strong showing in 2017 despite the competitive environment. 
Our priorities for the balance of this year and next year are unchanged. We'll start service to Cuba next month. We'll launch Mexico service from LAX under the new Mexico bilateral in December. We'll complete construction of new 5-gate international terminal in Fort Lauderdale in mid-2017 and then launch international flights thereafter. We'll deploy the booking feature of our new reservation system in December and begin flying those bookings in May of 2017 when we're fully deployed with our new reservation system. We'll launch the new Boeing 737 737 MAX next year and, coincidental with that, retire our Boeing 737 Classic fleet.
In addition to those initiatives, we also continue to focus on the basics, which are 3: running a reliable operation, offering our customers exceptional hospitality, and delivering superior profits and returns for our employees and our shareholders. 
So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo to take us through the quarter."

We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline fr",1590,"Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline from third quarter last year's record results. Aside from our normal hedge accounting adjustments, special items this quarter included $356 million in expense related to proposed union contract bonuses and $18 million charge related to the early termination of 4 of our Classic operating leases. 
As a result of the reduction in the outstanding shares from buyback activity, our earnings per share of $0.93 was down slightly by only 1% year-over-year, exceeding consensus by $0.05. The impact from our share repurchases is meaningful. And since 2011, we've decreased our share count by 18%, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Our third quarter EPS included about a $0.07 impact from our July technology outage. And without this impact, third quarter EPS excluding special items would have exceeded last year's record $0.94, with net income excluding special items comparable to last year's record $623 million. 
Of course, we're delighted with our return on invested capital, which was an outstanding 32.3% ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, a very strong performance, and I'd like to commend all of our hard-working employees in another stellar quarter, especially with a challenging operational environment from the technology outage. 
We remain excited about the progress on our commercial and operational investments, including our new reservation system that we will begin selling reservations on in December, followed by the transition to one reservation system planned for May of next year. 
And our outlook for fourth quarter supports another solid quarter and a tremendous year of strong results.
With that overview, I'll turn to revenues, which were a strong $5.1 billion. This was just $7 million shy of beating third quarter's last year's record, excluding the special revenue adjustment in third quarter last year. And if you exclude the $55 million unexpected reduction in our revenues from the technology outage, our third quarter passenger and operating revenues would have reached record levels.  The 4.1% year-over-year decline in operating unit revenues was driven by record third quarter traffic at lower yield. 
We did see improvement in close-in trends during the quarter. However, the fare environment remained challenging. Stable but soft is how I would characterize the yield environment in the third quarter, with average fares down over $7. 
Our freight revenues were impacted by softer demand environment. But our other revenues improved year-over-year, driven by strong record rewards in other ancillary performances, especially early bird and upgrading -- upgraded boarding products.
Overall, given the industry fare environment, we are pleased with our relative operating revenue performance.
Turning to our fourth quarter revenues outlook, while close-in trends have been encouraging, the industry yield environment remains competitive. And in addition, as other airlines noted on their call, fourth quarter comparisons will be challenged by the calendar placement of the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's. We estimate the calendar placement and compressed holiday travel, the week prior to Christmas, attributes [ph] an estimated 1.5 points of RASM penalty. 
As a result, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to decline in the 4% to 5% range, with October currently running down about 5%, including the impact of Hurricane Matthew. October's trending in line with what we saw in July and August, suggesting trends have stabilized. Based on the holiday shift, December is expected to have the most difficult year-over-year comparisons.
With respect to sequential third to fourth quarter trends, we're about 2 points off normal averages, which we attribute largely to the calendar placement of the holidays as well as the impact of the outage and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Matthew. Looking past all the noise around the holiday shift, we are very pleased with early January bookings and wouldn't rule out starting the year with flat to possibly positive year-over-year unit revenue comparisons. We currently expect fourth quarter freight and other revenues to increase from fourth quarter last year as well.
And moving now to our costs, our operating unit costs excluding special items decreased 2.4% year-over-year, largely from lower profit sharing and jet fuel prices. Our profit sharing for third quarter was $101 million compared with $177 million in third quarter last year. The lower profit sharing expense is due to the year-over-year increase in proposed union contract bonuses. 
Our economic jet fuel price per gallon declined a little over 8% year-over-year to $2.02 for the third quarter, which was driven by our lower crude and heating oil prices. We expect fuel prices to be higher here in the fourth quarter. And based on market prices last Thursday and our current fourth quarter hedge position, we expect our fourth quarter fuel prices per gallon to be close to $2.10.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit costs came in at 2.6%, which is better than we expected. When you consider that almost 1.5 points of this year-over-year increase is from accelerated depreciation associated with our Classic fleet retirement, and close to another point of increase was driven by costs associated with the July technology outage, this was a very solid performance. 
Based on the current trends, we expect fourth quarter 2016 CASM excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to increase in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. About 3.5 points of this increase relates to the impact of the recent tentative agreements in our ongoing labor negotiations, and another point relates to accelerated depreciation of the Classics. 
For full year 2016, we expect a 2% to 3% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items and profit sharing, with the impact of the recent labor negotiations driving just over a point of the increase. The remaining 1% increase is right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year, driven by the acceleration of the Classic fleet retirement. And as always, we remain focused on controlling spend to protect our low-cost structure and low-fare brand, which is even more essential to the increase in labor cost pressure in a challenging revenue environment. We are making important investments and operational planning and recoverability tools for our employees to improve the customer experience as well as our efficiency.
I have just a few comments on our liquidity and capital deployment. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion. We also have a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion, which was recently replaced and extended through August 2021 at favorable terms. 
Our estimated CapEx for this year remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft spend and approximately $700 million in nonaircraft capital spend. 
Our free cash flow of $392 million during third quarter enabled us to return $312 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase executed in July. And year-to-date, we have returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of $1.5 billion of common stock and the payment of $222 million of dividends. 
Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is in the low to mid-30% range.
I'll turn to the fleet and quickly walk you through that. We ended the quarter with 714 aircraft in our fleet. And our plan is to end the year with 723 aircraft, and that remains unchanged from what we last reported to you. We reached a meaningful milestone on in our fleet during the third quarter, with the retirement of our last -500 aircraft. We have 95 Classic 737-300s remaining our fleet that will be retired by the end of September of next year. 
During third quarter, we purchased 4 of our -300s of operating lease. The lease termination cost, it was recorded as an $18 million special item and essentially represents the cash payment for the equity buyout. We assumed ownership of the aircraft, thus adding the fair value of the aircraft as well as the associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet [indiscernible]. We will continue to pay the underlying debt payments, but we now avoid the lease return condition cost exposure.  
And our estimated EBIT improvement of our accelerated Classic retirement remains in excess of $200 million, as the prepayment of the rents were already contemplated in our original assumption.  As the economics of equity buyout were clearly favorable, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to do similar transactions with the remaining 31 Classics under operating lease that have terms that extend beyond September 30 of next year. 
Our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. And as we announced last month, in light of the current revenue environment, we are slowing our capacity growth next year to less than 4%, likely 3.5%. Our domestic growth is estimated to account for approximately 2 points of that growth, with the remaining allocated to international. We'll begin the year with approximately 4% growth in first quarter 2017, bending down to flat to slightly up in fourth quarter of 2017 due to the retirement of the Classic fleet by the end of the third quarter next year.
In closing, we are pleased with our strong performance thus far this year. And based on our fourth quarter outlook, we're thrilled with the prospect of ending the year with an ROIC of [indiscernible] 30%. And with that overview, we are ready to take questions."

And the report today is certainly not of weakness, it's of strength. We're looking forward to a really solid 2017. And we, as you well know, we have consistently outperformed the industry on the revenue front not just the last 24 months, but over a longer period of time going back well into 5 or 6 years ago. So we have a lot of tailwinds that we're looking forward to. We have a much smaller percentage of our route system under development. And that's after very aggressive '13, '14 and '15, which have resulted in stellar profits. So that should provide wonderful strength for us. It is appropriate for us to slow our growth and be measured in the expansion that we undertake here in the near term until our unit revenue turns positive. We are off of our revenue plan here in 2016, and it's largely a second half issue. As you recall, we had our analyst discussion back in June. And then weeks later, we're seeing that the fare environment had changed for us pretty significantly. So we have a lot of strengths. we are -- We have costs that are significantly below the vast majority of our competitors, certainly if you look at the number of seats that are out there. And we will continue to be strong and we will continue to operate strong. A lot of the revenue declines year-over-year that we've seen after June 30 are -- well, virtually all of them are in markets where we've seen competitive additions to those markets. So we'll be mindful of that competitive growth, but you know that we're going to use our balance sheet. We're going to use our cost structure. We're going to use our employees with the service we offer. And we'll fight hard to maintain every single customer that we fought hard to win."

In terms of how we -- of course, the past 4 quarters through the second quarter of last year, we benefited from a very significant improvement with our Chase credit card deal. So that lapses and that puts us in a position where I think until we find another way for us to differentiate our revenue production, we are going to kind of fall in with industry performance, which is where I see us here in the third quarter. That's where I see us in the fourth quarter, so I don't see that we are out of step at all. As to the mix of within Southwest Airlines of connecting versus nonstop traffic, I'll let Bob speak to that. We provide some insights there, but it is clear that to your -- if I think I understand where you're headed with your point, that the fare environment will absolutely impact the mix of traffic that we realize on our network. So that will ebb and flow. Sometimes, that's a positive effect in the short term. Sometimes, it's sa negative effect. It's nothing necessarily structural. We do have tools in place to manage that.

There were a lot of things that game online that we were confident that they would produce. They have produced, and they've been sustainable.

So it is certainly correct to say that we are one of those that is currently growing faster than GDP. And I'm mindful of that and hopefully have explained why that has been. I think prospectively, we'll need to be more conservative with our growth, and we're obviously committed to doing that in 2017.

But in the meantime, I'll just remind everybody that the profits are, if they're not record levels, they are near record levels. So I think what we'll want to do at Southwest is to continue to manage in a way that does not assume that these good times are extrapolated into infinity. I think that would be an enormous mistake. So the best discipline for us is to make sure that we keep revenues at a very healthy level. And then therefore for us, that means that we want to continue to hang on to the unit revenue gains that we worked hard to achieve. But that's pretty much it in a nutshell.

31726,307595936,1061859,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year-ago level",700,"Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year-ago levels by $0.01. We generated strong free cash flow of almost $400 million for the quarter and returned $312 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
RASM performed exactly in line with our expectation, and again that's taking into account the negative impact of 0.5 point that we had from the  technology outage. We have consistently outperformed the domestic industry for 2015 and for the first part of 2016. Along with the lapse of the year-over-year gains at our 2015 Chase deal, we've got harder comparisons in the near term. Even with the outperformance though, we've seen weakening sequential trends for a number of quarters now. But that feels like that's coming to an end, taking into account the timing of the holidays in September November and December January time period, the monthly and quarterly sequential trends look good to us. They look like they are stabilizing. I would quickly add, it's a little too early to tell if they are improving, although close in bookings and yields are improved. 
As compared to some of the guidance that I've heard from our competitors, there seems to be a difference between the expectations surrounding the December, January holiday time period. But it's our guess at this point, consistent with what we saw calendar-wise in 2011, that that might be as high as 1.5 points. We take that into account and again, our trends between third quarter and fourth quarter look very comparable and maybe even better.
A couple of very encouraging signs, first of all, the percent of new markets are developing markets are roughly at historic levels for us, down very significantly from where we were in 2014 and '15. This will continue and perhaps fall further in 2017 as we slow our domestic growth to roughly 2%. And of course, this bodes well for our unit revenue outlook. The domestic industry is growing seat miles well ahead of GDP growth. And we've seen significant competitive capacity adds in markets that we serve. And it's increased competition that's diluting revenue on routes that we serve, that accounts for the decline in unit revenue trends and especially here in 2016. 
We're planning for rising costs in 2017, and that is due to higher jet fuel prices and labor rates. Our goal is to arrest the trend of declining unit revenues in 2017 and achieve positive unit revenue comparisons for the year as compared to 2016. We'll rely primarily on basic revenue management and route design techniques to achieve that. And we're leaning heavily on our fleet modernization in the near term to help mitigate our unit cost pressures.
In the meantime, and as we anticipated again in 2017 -- for 2017, profits, cash flow, internal investments and shareholder returns are all strong. We achieved a 32.3% ROIC pretax for the 12 months ended September 30 and we'll be close to 30% for the year 2016. So I anticipate another very strong showing in 2017 despite the competitive environment. 
Our priorities for the balance of this year and next year are unchanged. We'll start service to Cuba next month. We'll launch Mexico service from LAX under the new Mexico bilateral in December. We'll complete construction of new 5-gate international terminal in Fort Lauderdale in mid-2017 and then launch international flights thereafter. We'll deploy the booking feature of our new reservation system in December and begin flying those bookings in May of 2017 when we're fully deployed with our new reservation system. We'll launch the new Boeing 737 737 MAX next year and, coincidental with that, retire our Boeing 737 Classic fleet.
In addition to those initiatives, we also continue to focus on the basics, which are 3: running a reliable operation, offering our customers exceptional hospitality, and delivering superior profits and returns for our employees and our shareholders. 
So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo to take us through the quarter."
31726,307595936,1061859,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline fr",1590,"Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline from third quarter last year's record results. Aside from our normal hedge accounting adjustments, special items this quarter included $356 million in expense related to proposed union contract bonuses and $18 million charge related to the early termination of 4 of our Classic operating leases. 
As a result of the reduction in the outstanding shares from buyback activity, our earnings per share of $0.93 was down slightly by only 1% year-over-year, exceeding consensus by $0.05. The impact from our share repurchases is meaningful. And since 2011, we've decreased our share count by 18%, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Our third quarter EPS included about a $0.07 impact from our July technology outage. And without this impact, third quarter EPS excluding special items would have exceeded last year's record $0.94, with net income excluding special items comparable to last year's record $623 million. 
Of course, we're delighted with our return on invested capital, which was an outstanding 32.3% ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, a very strong performance, and I'd like to commend all of our hard-working employees in another stellar quarter, especially with a challenging operational environment from the technology outage. 
We remain excited about the progress on our commercial and operational investments, including our new reservation system that we will begin selling reservations on in December, followed by the transition to one reservation system planned for May of next year. 
And our outlook for fourth quarter supports another solid quarter and a tremendous year of strong results.
With that overview, I'll turn to revenues, which were a strong $5.1 billion. This was just $7 million shy of beating third quarter's last year's record, excluding the special revenue adjustment in third quarter last year. And if you exclude the $55 million unexpected reduction in our revenues from the technology outage, our third quarter passenger and operating revenues would have reached record levels.  The 4.1% year-over-year decline in operating unit revenues was driven by record third quarter traffic at lower yield. 
We did see improvement in close-in trends during the quarter. However, the fare environment remained challenging. Stable but soft is how I would characterize the yield environment in the third quarter, with average fares down over $7. 
Our freight revenues were impacted by softer demand environment. But our other revenues improved year-over-year, driven by strong record rewards in other ancillary performances, especially early bird and upgrading -- upgraded boarding products.
Overall, given the industry fare environment, we are pleased with our relative operating revenue performance.
Turning to our fourth quarter revenues outlook, while close-in trends have been encouraging, the industry yield environment remains competitive. And in addition, as other airlines noted on their call, fourth quarter comparisons will be challenged by the calendar placement of the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's. We estimate the calendar placement and compressed holiday travel, the week prior to Christmas, attributes [ph] an estimated 1.5 points of RASM penalty. 
As a result, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to decline in the 4% to 5% range, with October currently running down about 5%, including the impact of Hurricane Matthew. October's trending in line with what we saw in July and August, suggesting trends have stabilized. Based on the holiday shift, December is expected to have the most difficult year-over-year comparisons.
With respect to sequential third to fourth quarter trends, we're about 2 points off normal averages, which we attribute largely to the calendar placement of the holidays as well as the impact of the outage and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Matthew. Looking past all the noise around the holiday shift, we are very pleased with early January bookings and wouldn't rule out starting the year with flat to possibly positive year-over-year unit revenue comparisons. We currently expect fourth quarter freight and other revenues to increase from fourth quarter last year as well.
And moving now to our costs, our operating unit costs excluding special items decreased 2.4% year-over-year, largely from lower profit sharing and jet fuel prices. Our profit sharing for third quarter was $101 million compared with $177 million in third quarter last year. The lower profit sharing expense is due to the year-over-year increase in proposed union contract bonuses. 
Our economic jet fuel price per gallon declined a little over 8% year-over-year to $2.02 for the third quarter, which was driven by our lower crude and heating oil prices. We expect fuel prices to be higher here in the fourth quarter. And based on market prices last Thursday and our current fourth quarter hedge position, we expect our fourth quarter fuel prices per gallon to be close to $2.10.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit costs came in at 2.6%, which is better than we expected. When you consider that almost 1.5 points of this year-over-year increase is from accelerated depreciation associated with our Classic fleet retirement, and close to another point of increase was driven by costs associated with the July technology outage, this was a very solid performance. 
Based on the current trends, we expect fourth quarter 2016 CASM excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to increase in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. About 3.5 points of this increase relates to the impact of the recent tentative agreements in our ongoing labor negotiations, and another point relates to accelerated depreciation of the Classics. 
For full year 2016, we expect a 2% to 3% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items and profit sharing, with the impact of the recent labor negotiations driving just over a point of the increase. The remaining 1% increase is right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year, driven by the acceleration of the Classic fleet retirement. And as always, we remain focused on controlling spend to protect our low-cost structure and low-fare brand, which is even more essential to the increase in labor cost pressure in a challenging revenue environment. We are making important investments and operational planning and recoverability tools for our employees to improve the customer experience as well as our efficiency.
I have just a few comments on our liquidity and capital deployment. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion. We also have a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion, which was recently replaced and extended through August 2021 at favorable terms. 
Our estimated CapEx for this year remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft spend and approximately $700 million in nonaircraft capital spend. 
Our free cash flow of $392 million during third quarter enabled us to return $312 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase executed in July. And year-to-date, we have returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of $1.5 billion of common stock and the payment of $222 million of dividends. 
Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is in the low to mid-30% range.
I'll turn to the fleet and quickly walk you through that. We ended the quarter with 714 aircraft in our fleet. And our plan is to end the year with 723 aircraft, and that remains unchanged from what we last reported to you. We reached a meaningful milestone on in our fleet during the third quarter, with the retirement of our last -500 aircraft. We have 95 Classic 737-300s remaining our fleet that will be retired by the end of September of next year. 
During third quarter, we purchased 4 of our -300s of operating lease. The lease termination cost, it was recorded as an $18 million special item and essentially represents the cash payment for the equity buyout. We assumed ownership of the aircraft, thus adding the fair value of the aircraft as well as the associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet [indiscernible]. We will continue to pay the underlying debt payments, but we now avoid the lease return condition cost exposure.  
And our estimated EBIT improvement of our accelerated Classic retirement remains in excess of $200 million, as the prepayment of the rents were already contemplated in our original assumption.  As the economics of equity buyout were clearly favorable, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to do similar transactions with the remaining 31 Classics under operating lease that have terms that extend beyond September 30 of next year. 
Our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. And as we announced last month, in light of the current revenue environment, we are slowing our capacity growth next year to less than 4%, likely 3.5%. Our domestic growth is estimated to account for approximately 2 points of that growth, with the remaining allocated to international. We'll begin the year with approximately 4% growth in first quarter 2017, bending down to flat to slightly up in fourth quarter of 2017 due to the retirement of the Classic fleet by the end of the third quarter next year.
In closing, we are pleased with our strong performance thus far this year. And based on our fourth quarter outlook, we're thrilled with the prospect of ending the year with an ROIC of [indiscernible] 30%. And with that overview, we are ready to take questions."

So we have a lot of tailwinds that we're looking forward to. We have a much smaller percentage of our route system under development. And that's after very aggressive '13, '14 and '15, which have resulted in stellar profits. So that should provide wonderful strength for us. It is appropriate for us to slow our growth and be measured in the expansion that we undertake here in the near term until our unit revenue turns positive. We are off of our revenue plan here in 2016, and it's largely a second half issue. As you recall, we had our analyst discussion back in June. And then weeks later, we're seeing that the fare environment had changed for us pretty significantly. So we have a lot of strengths. we are -- We have costs that are significantly below the vast majority of our competitors, certainly if you look at the number of seats that are out there.

And that's exactly what's happening here. So a couple of things need to happen. Either demand needs to improve, or supply needs to come in better alignment. But in the meantime, I'll just remind everybody that the profits are, if they're not record levels, they are near record levels. So I think what we'll want to do at Southwest is to continue to manage in a way that does not assume that these good times are extrapolated into infinity. I think that would be an enormous mistake. So the best discipline for us is to make sure that we keep revenues at a very healthy level. And then therefore for us, that means that we want to continue to hang on to the unit revenue gains that we worked hard to achieve. But that's pretty much it in a nutshell. That's what every other airline is seeing. And what they'll do to manage is obviously their business, but that's what we're going to do at Southwest."

But back to Savi's earlier question, with our current performance, we're going to look very hard at our route network and make some decisions about what routes we might want to cut, what routes we might want to increase. And just -- it's just a normal part of our process that we go through for every schedule for that matter. But it will be with an increased intensity here because we're not hitting our targets.

And of course, we just didn't start this year. This has been a process. I've been with Southwest 30 years, and we've been continually investing in technology and evolving the tools. Hardening or fortifying our technology is absolutely a component of our spending. Right now, we are in the midst of establishing a new data center which, in fact, has a complete redundant data center at the same place in addition to a backup facility. It's just one example. So all those things are underway. And with belief that -- just like a product, we want our airline to be better every year than it was the year before. And we want our technology tools and capabilities also to fit that kind of a definition. I think I've mentioned to you all many times before, we've got 2 basic stacks of technology that we're working on. We've got the commercial side of things with the new reservation system as the marquee item. But there's a long list of subprojects under that, that we have shared with you all, that are on the docket over the next several years. Likewise, Mike Van de Ven, on the outside of things, has a similar agenda and better automation and techniques -- rather, and tools and techniques and communication techniques are very much in the queue for work over the next several years with respect to our flight crews. So the outage was really odd. I think I would readily admit to everybody that it is impossible to have a failsafe back over [ph] for every conceivable scenario that had happened. But it is -- we're in really good shape and have a lot of experience in preventing outages like that. So hopefully, that addresses your question, but absolutely, we'll want to continue to invest to fortify our technology."

31726,307595936,1062053,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year ago level",698,"Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year ago levels by $0.01. We generated strong free cash flow of almost $400 million for the quarter and returned $312 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
RASM performed exactly in line with our expectation. And again, that's taking into account the negative impact of 0.5 point that we had from the technology outage. We have consistently outperformed the domestic industry for 2015 and for the first part of 2016. Along with the lapse of the year-over-year gains in our 2015 Chase deal, we've got harder comparisons in the near term. Even with the outperformance though, we've seen weakening sequential trends for a number of quarters now.
But that feels like that's coming to an end. Taking into account the timing of the holidays in September-November and December-January time period, the monthly and quarterly sequential trends look good to us. They look like they're stabilizing. As I would quickly add, it's a little too early to tell if they are improving, although close-in bookings and yields are improved.
As compared to some of the guidance that I've heard from our competitors, there seems to be a difference between the expectations surrounding the December-January holiday time period. But it's our guess at this point, consistent with what we saw calendar-wise in 2011, that, that might be as high as 1.5 points. We take that into account and again, our trends between third quarter and fourth quarter look very comparable and maybe even better.
A couple of very encouraging signs, first of all, the percent of new markets or developing markets are roughly at historic levels for us, down very significantly from where we were in 2014 and '15. This will continue and perhaps fall further in 2017 as we slow our domestic growth to roughly 2%. And of course, this bodes well for our unit revenue outlook.
The domestic industry is growing seat miles well ahead of GDP growth. And we've seen significant competitive capacity adds in markets that we serve. And it's increased competition that's diluting revenue on routes that we serve, that accounts for the decline in unit revenue trends and especially here in 2016.
We're planning for rising costs in 2017, and that is due to higher jet fuel prices and labor rates. Our goal is to arrest the trend of declining unit revenues in 2017 and achieve positive unit revenue comparisons for the year as compared to 2016. We'll rely primarily on basic revenue management and route design techniques to achieve that. And we're leaning heavily on our fleet modernization in the near term to help mitigate our unit cost pressures.
In the meantime, and as we anticipated again in 2017 -- for 2017, profits, cash flow, internal investments and shareholder returns are all strong. We achieved a 32.3% ROIC pretax for the 12 months ended September 30, and we'll be close to 30% for the year 2016. So I anticipate another very strong showing in 2017 despite the competitive environment. 
Our priorities for the balance of this year and next year are unchanged. We'll start service to Cuba next month. We'll launch Mexico service from LAX under the new U.S.-Mexico bilateral in December. We'll complete construction of a new 5-gate international terminal in Fort Lauderdale in mid-2017 and then launch new international flights thereafter. We'll deploy the booking feature of our new reservation system in December and begin flying those bookings in May of 2017 when we're fully deployed with our new reservation system. We'll launch the new Boeing 737 MAX next year and coincident with that, retire our Boeing 737 Classic fleet.
In addition to those initiatives, we'll also continue to focus on the basics, which are 3: running a reliable operation, offering our customers exceptional hospitality and delivering superior profits and returns for our employees and our shareholders.
So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo to take us through the quarter."
31726,307595936,1062053,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline fr",1592,"Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline from third quarter last year's record results. Aside from our normal hedge accounting adjustments, special items this quarter included $356 million in expense related to proposed union contract bonuses and $18 million charge related to the early termination of 4 of our Classic operating leases.
As a result of the reduction in the outstanding shares from buyback activity, our earnings per share of $0.93 was down slightly by only 1% year-over-year, exceeding consensus by $0.05. The impact from our share repurchases is meaningful. And since 2011, we've decreased our share count by 18%, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Our third quarter EPS included about a $0.07 impact from our July technology outage. And without this impact, third quarter EPS, excluding special items, would have exceeded last year's record $0.94, with net income, excluding special items, comparable to last year's record $623 million.
Of course, we're delighted with our return on invested capital, which was an outstanding 32.3% ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, a very strong performance, and I'd like to commend all of our hard-working employees on another stellar quarter, especially with the challenging operational environment from the technology outage.
We remain excited about the progress on our commercial and operational investments, including our new reservation system that we will begin selling reservations on in December, followed by the transition to one reservation system planned for May of next year. And our outlook for fourth quarter supports another solid quarter to end a tremendous year of strong results.
With that overview, I'll turn to revenues, which were a strong $5.1 billion. This was just $7 million shy of beating third quarter's last year's record, excluding the special revenue adjustment in third quarter last year. And if you exclude the $55 million unexpected reduction in our revenues from the technology outage, our third quarter passenger and operating revenues would have reached record levels. The 4.1% year-over-year decline in operating unit revenues was driven by record third quarter traffic at lower yields.
We did see improvement in close-in trends during the quarter. However, the fare environment remained challenging. Stable but soft is how I would characterize the yield environment in the third quarter, with average fares down over $7.
Our freight revenues were impacted by softer demand environment. But our other revenue improved year-over-year, driven by strong rec [ph] rewards and other ancillary performance, especially early bird and upgrading -- upgraded boarding products. Overall, given the industry fare environment, we are pleased with our relative operating revenue performance.
Turning to our fourth quarter revenue outlook. While close-in trends have been encouraging, the industry yield environment remains competitive. And in addition, as other airlines have noted on their calls, fourth quarter comparisons will be challenged by the calendar placement of the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's. We estimate the calendar placement and compressed holiday travel, the week prior to Christmas attributes an estimated 1.5 points of RASM penalty.
As a result, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to decline in the 4% to 5% range, with October currently running down about 5%, including the impact of Hurricane Matthew. October is trending in line with what we saw in July and August, suggesting trends have stabilized. Based on the holiday shift, December is expected to have the most difficult year-over-year comparison.
With respect to sequential third to fourth quarter trends, we're about 2 points off normal averages, which we attribute largely to the calendar placement of the holidays as well as the impact of the outage and to a lesser extent, Hurricane Matthew.
Looking past all the noise around the holiday shift, we are very pleased with early January bookings and wouldn't rule out starting the year with flat to possibly positive year-over-year unit revenue comparisons. We currently expect fourth quarter freight and other revenues to increase from fourth quarter last year as well.
And moving now to our costs, our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased 2.4% year-over-year, largely from lower profit sharing and jet fuel prices. Our profit sharing for the third quarter was $101 million compared with $177 million in third quarter last year. The lower profit sharing expense is due to the year-over-year increase in proposed union contract bonuses.
Our economic jet fuel price per gallon declined a little over 8% year-over-year to $2.02 for the third quarter, which was driven by lower crude and heating oil prices. We expect fuel prices to be higher here in the fourth quarter. And based on market prices last Thursday and our current fourth quarter hedge position, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be close to $2.10.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit costs came in up 2.6%, which is better than we expected. When you consider that almost 1.5 points of this year-over-year increase is from accelerated depreciation associated with our Classic fleet retirement and close to another 1 point of increase was driven by costs associated with the July technology outage, this was a very solid performance.
Based on the current trends, we expect fourth quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. About 3.5 points of this increase relates to the impact of the recent tentative agreements in our ongoing labor negotiations and another 1 point relates to accelerated depreciation of the Classics.
For the full year 2016, we expect a 2% to 3% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, with the impact of the recent labor negotiations, driving just over 1 point of the increase. The remaining 1% increase is right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year, driven by the acceleration of the Classic fleet retirement. And as always, we remain focused on controlling spend to protect our low-cost structure and low-fare brand, which is even more central with the increased labor cost pressure and a challenging revenue environment. We're making important investments and operational planning and recoverability tools for our employees to improve the customer experience as well as our efficiency.
I have just a few comments on our liquidity and capital deployment. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion. We also have a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion, which was recently replaced and extended through August 2021 at favorable terms.
Our estimated CapEx for this year remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft spend and approximately $700 million in nonaircraft capital spend.
Our free cash flow of $392 million during third quarter enabled us to return $312 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase executed in July. And year-to-date, we have returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of $1.5 billion of common stock and the payment of $222 million of dividends. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is in the low to mid-30% range.
I'll turn to the fleet and quickly walk you through that. We ended the quarter with 714 aircraft in our fleet. And our plan is to end the year with 723 aircraft, and that remains unchanged from what we last reported to you. We reached a meaningful milestone in our fleet during third quarter with the retirement of our last -500 aircraft. We have 95 Classic 737-300s remaining in our fleet that will be retired by the end of September of next year.
During third quarter, we purchased 4 of our -300s of operating lease. The lease termination cost, it was recorded as an $18 million special item and essentially represents the cash payment for the equity buyout. We assumed ownership of the aircraft, thus adding the fair value of the aircraft as well as the associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet of debt. We will continue to pay the underlying debt payments, but we now avoid the lease return condition cost exposure.
And our estimated EBIT improvement of our accelerated Classic retirement remains in excess of $200 million as the prepayment of the rents were already contemplated in our original assumption. As the economics of equity buyout were clearly favorable, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to do similar transactions with the remaining 31 Classics under operating lease that have terms that extend beyond September 30 of next year.
Our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. And as we announced last month, in light of the current revenue environment, we are slowing our capacity growth next year to less than 4%, likely 3.5%. Our domestic growth is estimated to account for approximately 2 points of that growth, with the remaining allocated to international. We'll begin the year with approximately 4% growth in first quarter 2017, bending down to flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the retirement of the Classic fleet by the end of the third quarter next year.
In closing, we're pleased with our strong performance thus far this year. And based on our fourth quarter outlook, we're thrilled with the prospect of ending the year with an ROIC near 30%.
And with that overview, we are ready to take questions."

And the report today is certainly not of weakness, it's of strength. We're looking forward to a really solid 2017. And we, as you well know, we have consistently outperformed the industry on the revenue front, not just the last 24 months, but over a longer period of time, going back well into 5 or 6 years ago. So we have a lot of tailwinds that we're looking forward to. We have a much smaller percentage of our route system under development, and that's after a very aggressive '13, '14 and '15, which have resulted in stellar profits. So that should provide wonderful strength for us. It is appropriate for us to slow our growth and be measured in the expansion that we undertake here in the near term until our unit revenue turns positive. We are off of our revenue plan here in 2016, and it's largely a second half issue. As you recall, we had our analyst discussion back in June. And then weeks later, we're seeing that the fare environment have changed for us pretty significantly. So we have a lot of strengths. We are -- we have costs that are significantly below the vast majority of our competitors, certainly if you look at the number of seats that are out there. And we will continue to be strong and we'll continue to operate strong. A lot of the revenue declines year-over-year that we've seen after June 30 are -- well, virtually all of them are in markets where we've seen competitive additions to those markets.

In terms of how we -- of course, the past 4 quarters through the second quarter of last year, we benefited from a very significant improvement with our Chase credit card deal, so that lapses. And that puts us in a position where I think until we find another way for us to differentiate our revenue production, we're going to kind of fall in with industry performance, which is where I see us here in the third quarter.

As to the mix of -- within Southwest Airlines of connecting versus nonstop traffic, I'll let Bob speak to that. We provide some insights there, but it is clear that, to your -- if I think I understand where you're headed with your point, that the fare environment will absolutely impact the mix of traffic that we realize on our network. So that will ebb and flow. Sometimes, that's a positive effect in the short term. Sometimes, it's a negative effect. There's nothing necessarily structural. We do have tools in place to manage that.

So it is certainly correct to say that we're one of those that is currently growing faster than GDP. And I'm mindful of that and hopefully have explained why that has been. I think prospectively, we'll need to be more conservative with our growth, and we're obviously committed to doing that in 2017.

I think this is all pretty predictable to -- if the scenario is lower input costs and capacity is then secondly, stepped-up is a consequence because profits are strong. There are more seats fighting for the same number of passengers essentially and prices are going to soften. And that's exactly what's happening here. So a couple of things need to happen. Either demand needs to improve, or supply needs to come in better alignment. But in the meantime, I'll just remind everybody that the profits are, if they're not record levels, they are near record levels. So I think what we'll want to do at Southwest is to continue to manage in a way that does not assume that these good times are extrapolated into infinity. I think that would be an enormous mistake. So the best discipline for us is to make sure that we keep revenues at a very healthy level. And then therefore, for us that means that we want to continue to hang on to the unit revenue gains that we worked hard to achieve. But that's pretty much it, a nutshell. That's what every other airline is seeing. And what they'll do to manage is obviously their business, but that's what we're going to do at Southwest."

And that's strategic and it's committed, and we will absolutely add to that. But back to Savi's earlier question, with our current performance, we're going to look very hard at our route network and make some decisions about what routes we might want to cut, what routes we might want to increase. And just -- it's just a normal part of our process, we go through it for every schedule for that matter. But it will be with an increased intensity here because we're not hitting our targets.

And a course, we just didn't start this year. This has been a process. I've been with Southwest, 30 years, and we've been continually investing in technology and evolving the tools. Hardening or fortifying our technology is absolutely a component of our spending. Right now, we are in the midst of establishing a new data center, which, in effect, has a complete redundant data center at the same place in addition to a backup facility. It's just one example. So all those things are underway. And with the belief that -- I mean, just like a product, we want our airline to be better every year than it was the year before. And we want our technology tools and capabilities also to fit that kind of a definition. I think I'd mentioned to you all many times before, we've got 2 basic stacks of technology that we're working on. We've got the commercial side of things, with the new reservation system as the marquee item. But there are a long list of subprojects under that, that we have shared with you all that are on the docket over the next several years. Likewise, Mike Van de Ven on the outside of things, has a similar agenda and better automation and techniques rather -- and tools and techniques and communication techniques are very much in the queue for work over the next several years with respect to our flight crews. So the outage was really odd. I think I would readily admit to everybody that it is impossible to have a fail-safe back over for every conceivable scenario that had happened. But it is -- we're in really good shape and have a lot of experience in preventing outages like that. So hopefully, that addresses your question, but absolutely, we'll want to continue to invest to fortify our technology."

Yes, I have expected that if the industry profits recover, which they have, and then we recovered more with lower fuel prices. It's just a natural extension of that is that individual companies are going to be more aggressive, and especially the smaller carriers. So I think it's all very predictable. What the effect of that behavior is, is less predictable. So we had a plan for 2016. It's turned out to be more aggressive than our results, and we go back and adjust. So -- but no, I don't think it's shocking where we are at all. And we'll continue to compete very aggressively in this environment.

We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year ago level",698,"Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year ago levels by $0.01. We generated strong free cash flow of almost $400 million for the quarter and returned $312 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
RASM performed exactly in line with our expectation. And again, that's taking into account the negative impact of 0.5 point that we had from the technology outage. We have consistently outperformed the domestic industry for 2015 and for the first part of 2016. Along with the lapse of the year-over-year gains in our 2015 Chase deal, we've got harder comparisons in the near term. Even with the outperformance though, we've seen weakening sequential trends for a number of quarters now.
But that feels like that's coming to an end. Taking into account the timing of the holidays in September-November and December-January time period, the monthly and quarterly sequential trends look good to us. They look like they're stabilizing. As I would quickly add, it's a little too early to tell if they are improving, although close-in bookings and yields are improved.
As compared to some of the guidance that I've heard from our competitors, there seems to be a difference between the expectations surrounding the December-January holiday time period. But it's our guess at this point, consistent with what we saw calendar-wise in 2011, that, that might be as high as 1.5 points. We take that into account and again, our trends between third quarter and fourth quarter look very comparable and maybe even better.
A couple of very encouraging signs, first of all, the percent of new markets or developing markets are roughly at historic levels for us, down very significantly from where we were in 2014 and '15. This will continue and perhaps fall further in 2017 as we slow our domestic growth to roughly 2%. And of course, this bodes well for our unit revenue outlook.
The domestic industry is growing seat miles well ahead of GDP growth. And we've seen significant competitive capacity adds in markets that we serve. And it's increased competition that's diluting revenue on routes that we serve, that accounts for the decline in unit revenue trends and especially here in 2016.
We're planning for rising costs in 2017, and that is due to higher jet fuel prices and labor rates. Our goal is to arrest the trend of declining unit revenues in 2017 and achieve positive unit revenue comparisons for the year as compared to 2016. We'll rely primarily on basic revenue management and route design techniques to achieve that. And we're leaning heavily on our fleet modernization in the near term to help mitigate our unit cost pressures.
In the meantime, and as we anticipated again in 2017 -- for 2017, profits, cash flow, internal investments and shareholder returns are all strong. We achieved a 32.3% ROIC pretax for the 12 months ended September 30, and we'll be close to 30% for the year 2016. So I anticipate another very strong showing in 2017 despite the competitive environment. 
Our priorities for the balance of this year and next year are unchanged. We'll start service to Cuba next month. We'll launch Mexico service from LAX under the new U.S.-Mexico bilateral in December. We'll complete construction of a new 5-gate international terminal in Fort Lauderdale in mid-2017 and then launch new international flights thereafter. We'll deploy the booking feature of our new reservation system in December and begin flying those bookings in May of 2017 when we're fully deployed with our new reservation system. We'll launch the new Boeing 737 MAX next year and coincident with that, retire our Boeing 737 Classic fleet.
In addition to those initiatives, we'll also continue to focus on the basics, which are 3: running a reliable operation, offering our customers exceptional hospitality and delivering superior profits and returns for our employees and our shareholders.
So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo to take us through the quarter."

We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million.

We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline from third quarter last year's record results. Aside from our normal hedge accounting adjustments, special items this quarter included $356 million in expense related to proposed union contract bonuses and an $18 million charge related to the early termination of 4 of our Classic operating leases.
As a result of the reduction in the outstanding shares from buyback activity, our earnings per share of $0.93 was down slightly by only 1% year-over-year, exceeding consensus by $0.05. The impact from our share repurchases is meaningful. And since 2011, we've decreased our share count by 18%, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Our third quarter EPS included about a $0.07 impact from our July technology outage. And without this impact, third quarter EPS, excluding special items, would have exceeded last year's record $0.94, with net income, excluding special items, comparable to last year's record $623 million.
Of course, we're delighted with our return on invested capital, which was an outstanding 32.3% ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, a very strong performance, and I'd like to commend all of our hard-working employees on another stellar quarter, especially with the challenging operational environment from the technology outage.
We remain excited about the progress on our commercial and operational investments, including our new reservation system that we will begin selling reservations on in December, followed by the transition to one reservation system planned for May of next year. And our outlook for fourth quarter supports another solid quarter to end a tremendous year of strong results.
With that overview, I'll turn to revenues, which were a strong $5.1 billion. This was just $7 million shy of beating third quarter's last year's record, excluding the special revenue adjustment in third quarter last year. And if you exclude the $55 million unexpected reduction in our revenues from the technology outage, our third quarter passenger and operating revenues would have reached record levels. The 4.1% year-over-year decline in operating unit revenues was driven by record third quarter traffic at lower yields.
We did see improvement in close-in trends during the quarter. However, the fare environment remained challenging. Stable but soft is how I would characterize the yield environment in the third quarter, with average fares down over $7.
Our freight revenues were impacted by a softer demand environment. But our other revenue improved year-over-year, driven by strong Rapid Rewards and other ancillary performance, especially early bird and upgrading -- upgraded boarding products. Overall, given the industry fare environment, we are pleased with our relative operating revenue performance.
Turning to our fourth quarter revenue outlook. While close-in trends have been encouraging, the industry yield environment remains competitive. And in addition, as other airlines have noted on their calls, fourth quarter comparisons will be challenged by the calendar placement of the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's. We estimate the calendar placement and compressed holiday travel the week prior to Christmas attributes an estimated 1.5 points of RASM penalty.
As a result, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to decline in the 4% to 5% range, with October currently running down about 5%, including the impact of Hurricane Matthew. October is trending in line with what we saw in July and August, suggesting trends have stabilized. Based on the holiday shift, December is expected to have the most difficult year-over-year comparison.
With respect to sequential third to fourth quarter trends, we're about 2 points off normal averages, which we attribute largely to the calendar placement of the holidays as well as the impact of the outage and to a lesser extent, Hurricane Matthew.
Looking past all the noise around the holiday shift, we are very pleased with early January bookings and wouldn't rule out starting the year with flat to possibly positive year-over-year unit revenue comparisons. We currently expect fourth quarter freight and other revenues to increase from fourth quarter last year as well.
And moving now to our costs, our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased 2.4% year-over-year, largely from lower profit sharing and jet fuel prices. Our profit sharing for the third quarter was $101 million compared with $177 million in third quarter last year. The lower profit sharing expense is due to the year-over-year increase in proposed union contract bonuses.
Our economic jet fuel price per gallon declined a little over 8% year-over-year to $2.02 for the third quarter, which was driven by lower crude and heating oil prices. We expect fuel prices to be higher here in the fourth quarter. And based on market prices last Thursday and our current fourth quarter hedge position, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be close to $2.10.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit costs came in up 2.6%, which is better than we expected. When you consider that almost 1.5 points of this year-over-year increase is from accelerated depreciation associated with our Classic fleet retirement and close to another 1 point of increase was driven by costs associated with the July technology outage, this was a very solid performance.
Based on the current trends, we expect fourth quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. About 3.5 points of this increase relates to the impact of the recent tentative agreements in our ongoing labor negotiations and another 1 point relates to accelerated depreciation of the Classics.
For the full year 2016, we expect a 2% to 3% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, with the impact of the recent labor negotiations driving just over 1 point of the increase. The remaining 1% increase is right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year, driven by the acceleration of the Classic fleet retirement. And as always, we remain focused on controlling spend to protect our low-cost structure and low-fare brand, which is even more essential with the increased labor cost pressure and a challenging revenue environment. We're making important investments in operational planning and recoverability tools for our employees to improve the customer experience as well as our efficiency.
I have just a few comments on our liquidity and capital deployment. We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion. We also have a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion, which was recently replaced and extended through August 2021 at favorable terms.
Our estimated CapEx for this year remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft spend and approximately $700 million in nonaircraft capital spend.
Our free cash flow of $392 million during third quarter enabled us to return $312 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase executed in July. And year-to-date, we have returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of $1.5 billion of common stock and the payment of $222 million of dividends. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is in the low to mid-30% range.
I'll turn to the fleet and quickly walk you through that. We ended the quarter with 714 aircraft in our fleet. And our plan is to end the year with 723 aircraft, and that remains unchanged from what we last reported to you. We reached a meaningful milestone in our fleet during third quarter with the retirement of our last -500 aircraft. We have 95 Classic 737-300s remaining in our fleet that will be retired by the end of September of next year.
During third quarter, we purchased 4 of our -300s off operating lease. The lease termination cost, it was recorded as an $18 million special item and essentially represents the cash payment for the equity buyout. We assumed ownership of the aircraft, thus adding the fair value of the aircraft as well as the associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet of debt. We will continue to pay the underlying debt payments, but we now avoid the lease return condition cost exposure.
And our estimated EBIT improvement of our accelerated Classic retirement remains in excess of $200 million as the prepayment of the rents were already contemplated in our original assumption. As the economics of equity buyout were clearly favorable, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to do similar transactions with the remaining 31 Classics under operating lease that have terms that extend beyond September 30 of next year.
Our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. And as we announced last month, in light of the current revenue environment, we are slowing our capacity growth next year to less than 4%, likely 3.5%. Our domestic growth is estimated to account for approximately 2 points of that growth, with the remaining allocated to international. We'll begin the year with approximately 4% growth in the first quarter of 2017, bending down to flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the retirement of the Classic fleet by the end of the third quarter next year.
In closing, we're pleased with our strong performance thus far this year. And based on our fourth quarter outlook, we're thrilled with the prospect of ending the year with an ROIC near 30%.
And with that overview, we are ready to take questions."

And we -- as you well know, we have consistently outperformed the industry on the revenue front, not just the last 24 months, but over a longer period of time, going back well into 5 or 6 years ago.

We have a much smaller percentage of our route system under development, and that's after a very aggressive '13, '14 and '15, which has resulted in stellar profits. So that should provide wonderful strength for us. It is appropriate for us to slow our growth and be measured in the expansion that we undertake here in the near term until our unit revenue turns positive. We are off of our revenue plan here in 2016, and it's largely a second half issue. As you recall, we had our analyst discussion back in June. And then weeks later, we're seeing that the fare environment has changed for us pretty significantly. So we have a lot of strengths.

Not at all. I think this is all pretty predictable to -- if the scenario is lower input costs and capacity is then, secondly, stepped-up as a consequence because profits are strong, there are more seats fighting for the same number of passengers essentially and prices are going to soften. And that's exactly what's happening here. So a couple of things need to happen. Either demand needs to improve, or supply needs to come in better alignment. But in the meantime, I'll just remind everybody that the profits are, if they're not record levels, they are near record levels. So I think what we'll want to do at Southwest is to continue to manage in a way that does not assume that these good times are extrapolated into infinity. I think that would be an enormous mistake. So the best discipline for us is to make sure that we keep revenues at a very healthy level. And then therefore, for us that means that we want to continue to hang on to the unit revenue gains that we worked hard to achieve. But that's pretty much it, a nutshell. That's what every other airline is seeing. And what they'll do to manage is obviously their business, but that's what we're going to do at Southwest."

And of course, we just didn't start this year. This has been a process. I've been with Southwest 30 years, and we've been continually investing in technology and evolving the tools. Hardening or fortifying our technology is absolutely a component of our spending. Right now, we are in the midst of establishing a new data center which, in effect, has a complete redundant data center at the same place in addition to a backup facility. It's just one example. So all those things are underway. And with the belief that -- I mean, just like a product, we want our airline to be better every year than it was the year before. And we want our technology tools and capabilities also to fit that kind of a definition. I think I'd mentioned to you all many times before, we've got 2 basic stacks of technology that we're working on. We've got the commercial side of things, with the new reservation system as the marquee item. But there are a long list of subprojects under that, that we have shared with you all that are on the docket over the next several years. Likewise, Mike Van de Ven on the outside of things, has a similar agenda and better automation and techniques rather -- and tools and techniques and communication techniques are very much in the queue for work over the next several years with respect to our flight crews. So the outage was really odd. I think I would readily admit to everybody that it is impossible to have a fail-safe back over for every conceivable scenario that could happen. but it is -- we're in really good shape and have a lot of experience in preventing outages like that. So hopefully, that addresses your question, but absolutely, we'll want to continue to invest to fortify our technology."

We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year ago level",698,"Thank you, Marcy, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased to report strong third quarter profits today and especially considering the effects of the technology outage that we suffered in July. Earnings per share were down from year ago levels by $0.01. We generated strong free cash flow of almost $400 million for the quarter and returned $312 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
RASM performed exactly in line with our expectation. And again, that's taking into account the negative impact of 0.5 point that we had from the technology outage. We have consistently outperformed the domestic industry for 2015 and for the first part of 2016. Along with the lapse of the year-over-year gains in our 2015 Chase deal, we've got harder comparisons in the near term. Even with the outperformance though, we've seen weakening sequential trends for a number of quarters now.
But that feels like that's coming to an end. Taking into account the timing of the holidays in September-November and December-January time period, the monthly and quarterly sequential trends look good to us. They look like they're stabilizing. As I would quickly add, it's a little too early to tell if they are improving, although close-in bookings and yields are improved.
As compared to some of the guidance that I've heard from our competitors, there seems to be a difference between the expectations surrounding the December-January holiday time period. But it's our guess at this point, consistent with what we saw calendar-wise in 2011, that, that might be as high as 1.5 points. We take that into account and again, our trends between third quarter and fourth quarter look very comparable and maybe even better.
A couple of very encouraging signs, first of all, the percent of new markets or developing markets are roughly at historic levels for us, down very significantly from where we were in 2014 and '15. This will continue and perhaps fall further in 2017 as we slow our domestic growth to roughly 2%. And of course, this bodes well for our unit revenue outlook.
The domestic industry is growing seat miles well ahead of GDP growth. And we've seen significant competitive capacity adds in markets that we serve. And it's increased competition that's diluting revenue on routes that we serve, that accounts for the decline in unit revenue trends and especially here in 2016.
We're planning for rising costs in 2017, and that is due to higher jet fuel prices and labor rates. Our goal is to arrest the trend of declining unit revenues in 2017 and achieve positive unit revenue comparisons for the year as compared to 2016. We'll rely primarily on basic revenue management and route design techniques to achieve that. And we're leaning heavily on our fleet modernization in the near term to help mitigate our unit cost pressures.
In the meantime, and as we anticipated again in 2017 -- for 2017, profits, cash flow, internal investments and shareholder returns are all strong. We achieved a 32.3% ROIC pretax for the 12 months ended September 30, and we'll be close to 30% for the year 2016. So I anticipate another very strong showing in 2017 despite the competitive environment. 
Our priorities for the balance of this year and next year are unchanged. We'll start service to Cuba next month. We'll launch Mexico service from LAX under the new U.S.-Mexico bilateral in December. We'll complete construction of a new 5-gate international terminal in Fort Lauderdale in mid-2017 and then launch new international flights thereafter. We'll deploy the booking feature of our new reservation system in December and begin flying those bookings in May of 2017 when we're fully deployed with our new reservation system. We'll launch the new Boeing 737 MAX next year and coincident with that, retire our Boeing 737 Classic fleet.
In addition to those initiatives, we'll also continue to focus on the basics, which are 3: running a reliable operation, offering our customers exceptional hospitality and delivering superior profits and returns for our employees and our shareholders.
So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo to take us through the quarter."
31726,307595936,1063301,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million.

We're delighted to report another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $388 million. And excluding special items, our net income was $582 million, which represented almost a 7% decline from third quarter last year's record results. Aside from our normal hedge accounting adjustments, special items this quarter included $356 million in expense related to proposed union contract bonuses and an $18 million charge related to the early termination of 4 of our Classic operating leases.
As a result of the reduction in the outstanding shares from buyback activity, our earnings per share of $0.93 was down slightly by only 1% year-over-year, exceeding consensus by $0.05. The impact from our share repurchases is meaningful. And since 2011, we've decreased our share count by 18%, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return value to our shareholders.
Our third quarter EPS included about a $0.07 impact from our July technology outage. And without this impact, third quarter EPS, excluding special items, would have exceeded last year's record $0.94, with net income, excluding special items, comparable to last year's record $623 million.
Of course, we're delighted with our return on invested capital, which was an outstanding 32.3% ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, a very strong performance, and I'd like to commend all of our hard-working employees on another stellar quarter, especially with the challenging operational environment from the technology outage.
We remain excited about the progress on our commercial and operational investments, including our new reservation system that we will begin selling reservations on in December, followed by the transition to one reservation system planned for May of next year. And our outlook for fourth quarter supports another solid quarter to end a tremendous year of strong results.
With that overview, I'll turn to revenues, which were a strong $5.1 billion. This was just $7 million shy of beating third quarter's last year's record, excluding the special revenue adjustment in third quarter last year. And if you exclude the $55 million unexpected reduction in our revenues from the technology outage, our third quarter passenger and operating revenues would have reached record levels. The 4.1% year-over-year decline in operating unit revenues was driven by record third quarter traffic at lower yields.
We did see improvement in close-in trends during the quarter. However, the fare environment remained challenging. Stable but soft is how I would characterize the yield environment in the third quarter, with average fares down over $7.
Our freight revenues were impacted by a softer demand environment. But our other revenue improved year-over-year, driven by strong Rapid Rewards and other ancillary performance, especially early bird and upgrading -- upgraded boarding products. Overall, given the industry fare environment, we are pleased with our relative operating revenue performance.
Turning to our fourth quarter revenue outlook. While close-in trends have been encouraging, the industry yield environment remains competitive. And in addition, as other airlines have noted on their calls, fourth quarter comparisons will be challenged by the calendar placement of the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's. We estimate the calendar placement and compressed holiday travel the week prior to Christmas attributes an estimated 1.5 points of RASM penalty.
As a result, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to decline in the 4% to 5% range, with October currently running down about 5%, including the impact of Hurricane Matthew. October is trending in line with what we saw in July and August, suggesting trends have stabilized. Based on the holiday shift, December is expected to have the most difficult year-over-year comparison.
With respect to sequential third to fourth quarter trends, we're about 2 points off normal averages, which we attribute largely to the calendar placement of the holidays as well as the impact of the outage and to a lesser extent, Hurricane Matthew.
Looking past all the noise around the holiday shift, we are very pleased with early January bookings and wouldn't rule out starting the year with flat to possibly positive year-over-year unit revenue comparisons. We currently expect fourth quarter freight and other revenues to increase from fourth quarter last year as well.
And moving now to our costs, our operating unit costs, excluding special items, decreased 2.4% year-over-year, largely from lower profit sharing and jet fuel prices. Our profit sharing for the third quarter was $101 million compared with $177 million in third quarter last year. The lower profit sharing expense is due to the year-over-year increase in proposed union contract bonuses.
Our economic jet fuel price per gallon declined a little over 8% year-over-year to $2.02 for the third quarter, which was driven by lower crude and heating oil prices. We expect fuel prices to be higher here in the fourth quarter. And based on market prices last Thursday and our current fourth quarter hedge position, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be close to $2.10.
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit costs came in up 2.6%, which is better than we expected. When you consider that almost 1.5 points of this year-over-year increase is from accelerated depreciation associated with our Classic fleet retirement and close to another 1 point of increase was driven by costs associated with the July technology outage, this was a very solid performance.
Based on the current trends, we expect fourth quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. About 3.5 points of this increase relates to the impact of the recent tentative agreements in our ongoing labor negotiations and another 1 point relates to accelerated depreciation of the Classics.
For the full year 2016, we expect a 2% to 3% increase in our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, with the impact of the recent labor negotiations driving just over 1 point of the increase. The remaining 1% increase is right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year, driven by the acceleration of the Classic fleet retirement. And as always, we remain focused on controlling spend to protect our low-cost structure and low-fare brand, which is even more essential with the increased labor cost pressure and a challenging revenue environment. We're making important investments in operational planning and recoverability tools for our employees to improve the customer experience as well as our efficiency.
I have just a few comments on our liquidity and capital deployment. We ended the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion. We also have a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion, which was recently replaced and extended through August 2021 at favorable terms.
Our estimated CapEx for this year remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of that for aircraft spend and approximately $700 million in nonaircraft capital spend.
Our free cash flow of $392 million during third quarter enabled us to return $312 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase executed in July. And year-to-date, we have returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of $1.5 billion of common stock and the payment of $222 million of dividends. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is in the low to mid-30% range.
I'll turn to the fleet and quickly walk you through that. We ended the quarter with 714 aircraft in our fleet. And our plan is to end the year with 723 aircraft, and that remains unchanged from what we last reported to you. We reached a meaningful milestone in our fleet during third quarter with the retirement of our last -500 aircraft. We have 95 Classic 737-300s remaining in our fleet that will be retired by the end of September of next year.
During third quarter, we purchased 4 of our -300s off operating lease. The lease termination cost, it was recorded as an $18 million special item and essentially represents the cash payment for the equity buyout. We assumed ownership of the aircraft, thus adding the fair value of the aircraft as well as the associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet of debt. We will continue to pay the underlying debt payments, but we now avoid the lease return condition cost exposure.
And our estimated EBIT improvement of our accelerated Classic retirement remains in excess of $200 million as the prepayment of the rents were already contemplated in our original assumption. As the economics of equity buyout were clearly favorable, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to do similar transactions with the remaining 31 Classics under operating lease that have terms that extend beyond September 30 of next year.
Our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. And as we announced last month, in light of the current revenue environment, we are slowing our capacity growth next year to less than 4%, likely 3.5%. Our domestic growth is estimated to account for approximately 2 points of that growth, with the remaining allocated to international. We'll begin the year with approximately 4% growth in the first quarter of 2017, bending down to flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the retirement of the Classic fleet by the end of the third quarter next year.
In closing, we're pleased with our strong performance thus far this year. And based on our fourth quarter outlook, we're thrilled with the prospect of ending the year with an ROIC near 30%.
And with that overview, we are ready to take questions."

And the report today is certainly not of weakness, it's of strength. We're looking forward to a really solid 2017. And we -- as you well know, we have consistently outperformed the industry on the revenue front, not just the last 24 months, but over a longer period of time, going back well into 5 or 6 years ago. So we have a lot of tailwinds that we're looking forward to. We have a much smaller percentage of our route system under development, and that's after a very aggressive '13, '14 and '15, which has resulted in stellar profits. So that should provide wonderful strength for us. It is appropriate for us to slow our growth and be measured in the expansion that we undertake here in the near term until our unit revenue turns positive. We are off of our revenue plan here in 2016, and it's largely a second half issue. As you recall, we had our analyst discussion back in June. And then weeks later, we're seeing that the fare environment has changed for us pretty significantly. So we have a lot of strengths. We are -- we have costs that are significantly below the vast majority of our competitors, certainly if you look at the number of seats that are out there. And we will continue to be strong and we'll continue to operate strong. A lot of the revenue declines year-over-year that we've seen after June 30 are -- well, virtually all of them are in markets where we've seen competitive additions to those markets. So we'll be mindful of that competitive growth, but you know that we're going to use our balance sheet. We're going to use our cost structure. We're going to use our employees with the service that we offer, and we'll fight hard to maintain every single customer that we've fought hard to win."

Tammy's already pointed out that we have an opportunity for positive unit revenue performance beginning in the first quarter. Some of the January strength that we're seeing, of course, admittedly is the holiday shift. But I think the main tailwind that I'm encouraged with is the fewer number of markets under development that's sort of balanced against the number of markets that are now facing more competition. So on balance right now, that's a negative number."

And if you actually go back to periods where this -- where the holiday timing fell at the same spot on the calendar, I think that's 2011 and 2005, our forecast lines up with what we saw back in 2005 and 2011.

I think this is all pretty predictable to -- if the scenario is lower input costs and capacity is then, secondly, stepped-up as a consequence because profits are strong, there are more seats fighting for the same number of passengers essentially and prices are going to soften. And that's exactly what's happening here. So a couple of things need to happen. Either demand needs to improve, or supply needs to come in better alignment. But in the meantime, I'll just remind everybody that the profits are, if they're not record levels, they are near record levels. So I think what we'll want to do at Southwest is to continue to manage in a way that does not assume that these good times are extrapolated into infinity. I think that would be an enormous mistake. So the best discipline for us is to make sure that we keep revenues at a very healthy level. And then therefore, for us that means that we want to continue to hang on to the unit revenue gains that we worked hard to achieve. But that's pretty much it, a nutshell. That's what every other airline is seeing. And what they'll do to manage is obviously their business, but that's what we're going to do at Southwest."

And of course, we just didn't start this year. This has been a process. I've been with Southwest 30 years, and we've been continually investing in technology and evolving the tools. Hardening or fortifying our technology is absolutely a component of our spending. Right now, we are in the midst of establishing a new data center which, in effect, has a complete redundant data center at the same place in addition to a backup facility. It's just one example. So all those things are underway. And with the belief that -- I mean, just like a product, we want our airline to be better every year than it was the year before. And we want our technology tools and capabilities also to fit that kind of a definition. I think I'd mentioned to you all many times before, we've got 2 basic stacks of technology that we're working on. We've got the commercial side of things, with the new reservation system as the marquee item. But there are a long list of subprojects under that, that we have shared with you all that are on the docket over the next several years. Likewise, Mike Van de Ven on the outside of things, has a similar agenda and better automation and techniques rather -- and tools and techniques and communication techniques are very much in the queue for work over the next several years with respect to our flight crews. So the outage was really odd. I think I would readily admit to everybody that it is impossible to have a fail-safe back over for every conceivable scenario that could happen. but it is -- we're in really good shape and have a lot of experience in preventing outages like that. So hopefully, that addresses your question, but absolutely, we'll want to continue to invest to fortify our technology."

So they're going where the traffic is, and that is our specialty because we are a -- we're an airline that serves major markets with lots of traffic.
