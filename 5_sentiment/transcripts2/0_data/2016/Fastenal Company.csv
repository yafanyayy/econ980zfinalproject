270747,321233776,918944,"Fastenal Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter call.

And I think the best way to",2901,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. The -- 2015 was a tough year for our customers. As the year progressed and as we reported our various quarters, we touched on how that was playing out. And I think the best way to look at 2015 is to look at a subset of customers where we have a substantial market share presence and that's our top 100 customers. That group represents about 24% of our revenues. And it isn't about that group -- what's going on in that group. It's about what's going on there relative to what we've seen in the past. 
If I look at that top 100 group of customers, and look over the last 4 years, history says that at any given point in time, 75% -- 75 of those 100 customers should be growing. And the reason that number is high as it is because of the growth drivers that Fastenal has at its disposal between our store operation, our vending operation and all those things we can bring to our customer's stable. 
In the first quarter this year, 72 of our 100 customers grew. In the second quarter, that dropped to 63. In the third quarter, that dropped to 56. In the fourth quarter, that dropped to 49. So in the fourth quarter, half our top 100 customers grew and half contracted. In the month of December, to amplify that a little this, 41 of our top 100 customers grew and 59 contracted. 
The next thing I looked at is trying to gauge -- of the customers that are contracting, how severe is their pain. And history says of the 25 that are contracting, about half of that number, well, 13, will contract more than 10% and about half that a number, again, about 6 are going to contract more than 25%. And what that last group, that's really a sign of the severity of their pain and what's going on in their industry. We sell across the continent, around the planet, most of our business are in North America. And we sell to a lot of different industries. And when you start looking to the list of a lot of names that you recognize stand out, and you can see the pain they're feeling in their business. 
In the first quarter, that 13 that are down more than 10% and the 6 that are down more than 25% look like our numbers, we have 13 and 3 in that bucket.
By the third quarter, that had slid to 32 of our customers that were down more than 10% and 17 of those were down more than 25%. 
After looking at that, that on the third quarter, on our third quarter call on October, when Will and I went through our commentary on the quarter, I -- u could question the wisdom of the statement, but I made the statement that the industrial economy is in a recession. And I used this as my reference point. Again, you could question the wisdom of saying it out loud. But the fourth quarter, 37 of our top 100 customers were down more than 10%. 22 of that group were down more than 25%.
There's one customer in that group where we did lose some business because of acquisition. Other than that, this is pain those customers are feeling as they progress through calendar 2015. 
In the month of December, November and December, I noted in the earnings release, we saw some shutdowns of our customers. We really saw it in the month of December. In the month of December, the Monday before Christmas, looking at the numbers and consulting with a few of our folks internally what they were seeing in the trends, the trends looked a lot like 2014 in that the Monday before Christmas, I felt we had a very good chance of having sales being flat, December to December. And in the ensuing days, the balance of that week and then the week between Christmas and New Year, quickly saw the erode as customers were falling off in their business activity. And we produced the number we reported this morning. 
The start of January and again, you could question the wisdom of the thinking of this commentary with as of yesterday, our month of January is trending to look like there's a potential for us to be positive in the month of January. A lot can change between now and the end of the month as we saw in the month December. We don't have holidays, but we do have weather. But as of the 14th, we are trending in a pattern that looks like we should be able to tread water be slightly positive and time will tell how that plays out.
The next item probably of note in the earnings release is our gross margin. Long-term trends that we've talked about on previous calls, that we talked about on our Investor Day in early November, are unchanged. One thing we did see in the quarter and it was most [indiscernible] in November and December as our customers were tightening their belts, we saw a layer of transactions just evaporate from our business. And the layered transitions, if you look at our business, there's stuff that we sell every day. Vending is a perfect examples of products we sell every day through our store operations, through our regular sales channel, through our bin stocking, and our OEMs stocking, there's product that we sell every week and every month. 
There's also a subset of products that we sell on a less frequent basis, some of those out of our stores, some out of our distribution centers. A piece that, a layer of that transaction disappeared, and that's higher-margin business for us. And our gross margin drop was largely attributed to that disappearing. That's the bad news. The good news, I believe, we did not see a structural change in our gross margin. Time will tell if that layer returns and how much it returns. I am hopeful and expecting that it largely will. 
On the expense side, this is -- I officially became CEO on January 1 of this year from a practical standpoint after the board informed me of the decision of stepping their role in mid-October. Will and I tagged team it a bit, but this quarter was largely under my watch. And I think from an expense standpoint, we frankly, did a mediocre job. And I put that squarely on my shareholders. Full-time and part time expense trends, and I'm looking -- our biggest expense on the P&L after cost of goods is people. We have just over 20,000 employees.
The fourth quarter and the seasonality of our business is no secret to anybody who owns our stock, there's no secret to anybody who works at Fastenal. In 2014, if I look at our expense trends for full-time headcount for Q3 to Q4, we managed it well. There's always some attrition in the business. We try not to replace that attrition in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of last year, our full-time dollars paid, and this is base pay only, dropped about 0.003%.
Our part-time, we can manage hours quite well and as we typically go into the post-Thanksgiving season, we see our expense falling off, because there's less work to do and therefore, we need fewer hours. In last year, from Q3 to Q4, our expense dropped about 13.5% for our part-time labor. In total our expense was down about 2.5%, 2.4% to be exact. 
In 2015, full-time headcount crept up a little bit to 3 point -- it increased about 3.5%. Our part-time dropped about 4.5%. I'm throwing a lot of percentages out here and it's not about the percentages. And quite frankly, it's not even about the expense itself. It's about managing the business through the seasonality of the year and we could have done a better job.
In total, our labor costs were down from Q3 to Q4, but that's really more of a function of when we don't do a good job, the leaders of our business at the district, the region, at the national level, as well as our support areas, feel they impacted that in their bonus program. Our bonus programs are largely, mechanically produce numbers. And so our overall expenses were down despite the fact we didn't managed the expense well, but they could have been down more. 
The message I've conveyed to our regional and national leadership is, right now, we are in, and in certain economy, we made substantial investments in calendar 2015. We added about 1,700 people into our stores. We added about 2,300 people into our organization in general. We are well-staffed. To that end, I would expect our headcount to not grow between now and March 31. As we see some stabilization, assuming we see some stabilization, and we believe there's reason for that belief to be there, as we see stabilization, we'll revisit our willingness to make investments in both store and support areas as we go into the new year.
If I look at the rest of our SG&A expense. We did a nice job on the occupancy side. The increase in that area was solely related to vending. As I've talked about in the past, I see that as a good expense increase because we know vending, where it touches our business, improves our interaction, our interface, our engagement with our customer and improves our growth. 
For those of you that -- I'm approaching this conference call in the vein of -- I have stepped out of my CEO role and I'm stepping into the CEO role, so I'm probably -- I'm trying to avoid the weed as much as possible, probably get into a bit with the last few sets of numbers. So things had to change habits. 
I will point out one thing, if you look at expense trends, our history is set from Q4 to Q1. We're going into winter. The last week here in Minnesota has been subzero so winter is definitely here. I typically expect to see our utilities increase about $2.3 million from Q4 to Q1, and that's solely related to heating locations. Thought I'd throw it out there for those of you that find that of interest.
We also had an item that we highlighted, or several items we highlighted in the positives and negatives of our earnings release. We made the decision, and we've been bouncing this around for a number of months -- a number of quarters, excuse me, but we made the decision to close down our joint venture manufacturing facility, or to exit participating in our joint venture manufacturing facility in Brazil. We have several other disputes unrelated to that that we also resolve in the quarter. The tally of all those items was about a $4 million impact to the quarter. I thought it was worth noting again, for what it's worth department. 
Finally, let's talk about 2016 and some of the things we told you to prepare for 2016. At our Investor Day in early November, we had a great participation, for those of you that made it, thank you for attending. For those of you that had the opportunity to listen to it, I hope you found it informative. We really focused on 4 items that day. The one was our FAST Solutions, our industrial vending program. That's not new to everybody and we've grown that business wonderfully over the last 5 years. We're very excited about that business. And when I look at that business today, about 45% of our districts in the company have more than 200 machines in their business scattered across 10, 11, 12 stores. We made the decision that at this stage in our Fastenal vending business, we wanted to place more dedicated resources within our districts to support that business and really challenge them in a two-pronged attack. 
The first one was what we call optimizing of our machines. And that's really looking at the data across these 200 machines, 300 machines, 100 machines, depending on the district you're looking, looking at those machines and optimizing the machines. The math is really quite simple when you think about our helix machines and most machines out there are helix. And that is if we want a machine to do -- pick a number, $1,500 a month and every time a call spins, on average, it drops $5 worth of product. That means in the course of 1 month, we need to spin the coil 300x in that machine. 20 days in the month, 15x a day, a coil needs to spin.
And we need to look at the products in that machine and say, can we get 15 spins a day. If we can, we know we have a homerun. If we can't, we need to work to optimize the machine. And that's what we're doing right now. 
When we spoke to you in early November about 11% of our machines across the company had been optimized already. As of the end of December, that number is up to 18%. And the team that is driving that, clearly, it's everybody in the organization, it's the folks in the stores, it's our district managers, it's our regional leaders, it's folks involved in our vending program, but the actual dedicated team, we started the quarter with about 60 individuals, we added just over 130. So we have about 191. Our goal is to get to about 230 people to support our 260 district managers in North America. And the way we pay for that group is through optimization, and we're 18% of the way complete. But we have a ways to go. 
After they get that piece, their next prong of attack will be helping to grow our signings, helping to grow that business. It's a wonderful business. It's a business when you truly inform your customer what it's about, it sell itself. 
The second half that we talk about is related to vending in our November Investor Day, centered on the use what we call our vending tab, and that's really about the efficiencies behind the scenes. Of 13% of our stores, we're using the venting tab and it's really how we replenish the machines and how automated that process becomes. As of the end of December, we're at 29% of our stores are now using the vending tab. 
The second item we talked about was a relatively new concept for us to talk open about externally and that's our Onsite program. History has said, we'll add about 9 a year. It's a program where we take a store and we essentially set up a store Onsite inside the customers' facility. And it takes engagement one step further, even deeper than vending does. It changes the relationship with the customer. In the current year, we signed 82 Onsites, again, our average was 9.
Those 82 Onsites came from 71 districts in the company. So, it means presumably 10 people signed 2. Those districts grew double digits, and it's so in 2015, the company grew 3.5% roughly for the year. The 71 districts on it -- if you average the group out, grew double digits in 2015 because they had a means to combat what the economy was doing to them, they grow their business. They took market share in a faster pace. 
Our goal as we enter 2015 -- 2016, excuse me, is to 200. We -- in the first -- as -- through Wednesday of this week, we've signed 5 this month. If you had take that to the month it would imply a run rate of about 12 or 13 for the month. If you had take that times 12, it imply a number just under 150. We have little ways to go, but I think we're off to a good start. And I'm optimistic what this means for 2016, but as importantly for '17, '18 and '19 and '20. 
This customer-specific business take Onsites add to it what we call our strategic comp customers, which is an Onsite that's just down the street or near the customer, but not physically in the building. If you add this all together, it's about 16% of our business today. I'm very optimistic about what this can be in the future because with our low-cost model we're uniquely designed as a business to go after. 
The third item we touched on in November was e-commerce, our 2016 plans centered on our website rollout for Canada, and then ultimately, the U.S. That's not really a 2016 story. That's more of a 2017 story that we wanted to provide an update on things that are in the works as it relates to the e-commerce strategy. And finally, we talked mostly 2016. That is a re-merchandising of our stores. We converted about 800 stores to this format in the fourth quarter. We intend to do a similar number in the first. And really, it's about positioning our store locations to be even better equipped that same-day service and efficient replenishment for our customers. And we're excited about what that means for our future.
With that, I will open up to Q&A. Thank you."

Just companies that are involved in really a weak industrial economy. I can't say that I've seen the contingent change. One thing I've always said over the years is -- the history in this business, for  Fastenal's business, that is, that the trends from January to October are the trends that really matter. November and December are months you go through, but history have said they're never really indicative of anything. We saw some patterns in November, December, I thought that were worth noting, but I don't think there's anything that we've learned in the last 2 months that tell us if it's spreading, if it's stabilized, other than what we saw with 10 days left in December and what we're saying in the first 8 days or so of January. And again, I throw it out of there only because when there's more uncertainty, I do believe, and I've always believed this, that we have an obligation to maybe share a little bit more insight. And so we're trying to share as much as we can. But always mindful of the fact that the month can change on a dime. One of the reasons we've never talked about January in the January call or we've done it very infrequently is that we're always wrong. The question is how much. But I can't say that we know anything about the contagion."

And like a vending machine, you sign it in November, it might take you 60 days, 90 days to turn it on. It's about, to me, it's about momentum. And but it's as far as what it means for the year. My belief for these growth drivers and what they mean for calendar 2016 is some completely unchanged from what I believed in November. A lot -- what I believe is -- I am very a practical person and what I believe is based on what I see in fact. And what I see in fact is a tremendous advantage we have. In the pieces we talked about in November whether it be vending or Onsite, Fastenal is uniquely situated to go after those 2 businesses unlike any other company out there because one of the things that I always tell our folks internally and I try to remember myself as, in a world where everybody is talking about building the last mile in this online world, we're a company that's built the last mile already. It's a very efficient last mile. And how can we take that last mile, take our employees at the store, take our employees that are supporting the store and together grow a great business.

Was really wanted to focus, which just on the gross margin commentary in the release. You mentioned that substantially, I think was the word, all the year-over-year decline was on that lower discretionary spend, yet you also, in that paragraph, talked about pressures from lower rebates and mix and deflation. So, if it's all from lower discretionary spend, it doesn't seem to leave much room for those other factors. So I'm curious, like what the commentary is really kind of on gross margin? And especially going forward, is there any reason to think that the trend will change in '16 versus what we saw in '15?"

And our team that really challenges our gross margin and finds opportunities for us to improve it had a lengthy discussion with them over the last few weeks. And after them providing us with a dizzying amount of data, I just said, you know what, what really happened? Did our gross margin structurally change or is there more to it? Because the usual suspects are still there. There's always a nominal impact in the fourth quarter based on what's going on with our rebates, what's going on with the utilization of our trucking network. The same trucks are running in November and December that are running in October and September, but they're carrying fewer packages. So you'll always have some leakage there in our gross margin. And depending on the year, it's a strong year, you get a lift from some of the supplier [indiscernible], some you get a little drag. So those are the usual suspects. The wildcard in it is there were a layer of transactions that just disappeared. And they disappeared, we saw them disappear in both November and December, and that was shining through in our gross margin. And that really was the cause of our gross margin change. I honestly don't know if that layer comes back in January and February. I don't know if the belts are really tight and starts to come back for a few months, or this is stuff that was needed and people were towards the end of their fiscal year and they just turned off the spigots and they closed their pill books and they didn't buy anything. History -- I'm a firm believer that trends have meaning. And if history says these transactions are there because the business needs them over time, I believe they'll return and I don't believe it's structural, but only time will tell."

The CapEx, as we talked about in early November, we came in on a net basis because we sold our old distribution center up in [indiscernible], so we had some proceeds there. But on a net basis, we spent about $145 million on CapEx in 2015, which is ab",672,"Yes. The CapEx, as we talked about in early November, we came in on a net basis because we sold our old distribution center up in [indiscernible], so we had some proceeds there. But on a net basis, we spent about $145 million on CapEx in 2015, which is about a 15% drop from what we've seen in 2014, which is about 8%, 9% drop from what we saw in 2013. And really what had happened is in -- back in 2011 time frame, we had an Investor Day, and we talked about how our CapEx was going to be going up. History has said our CapEx should be somewhere between 25% and 30% of our earnings. That was pretty good acrid number over a decade. And we noted that for a multiyear period, that number was going to materially go up. And then 2 things that were really going to drive that increase centered on we were putting automation into our distribution centers and today, over 80% of our picking activity occurs in automated distribution centers. The most meaningful project we have one right now, we're placing -- we're adding automation into our distribution center in North Carolina, that's a 2016 project. But we were going to have a 3-year period where we're putting in a massive amount of automation. And that came with the price tag. And so, that is largely behind us. This year, our CapEx as it relates to facilities centered on the North Carolina facility I talked about and then investments in Indianapolis related to manufacture and expansion of our automated warehouse. The other piece was we were very optimistic about what vending could be. And we knew that we were going to be spending a tremendous amount of dollars on vending over a multiyear period. Two, we felt very good about the ability for us to grow the business. And the second half of that equation is we didn't want to run out of supply, so we built an inventory machines. And so, today, our spend is coming down in both of those, largely because the automation is behind us. And then the vending standpoint, our patterns are more stable today and we're able to burn a little bit of that inventory as well. So all those pieces, we identified in November and expectations that CapEx would drop probably around 12% to just under $130 million. And the only wildcard on that center is on the things that we come -- the pace of what we to with vending as we go through the year. There's some things I'm optimistic about and we'll see how they play out, but that's the -- probably the only wildcard, whereas the rest of the projects are pretty well-known at this vantage point. Dividend, we just announced, $0.30 dividend last night. We've running at $0.28. So if that were to continue throughout the year, that would imply about a $344 million dividend versus the $327 million last year based on where our share count is right now. And then the wildcard is what we do in buybacks. We did a fair amount of buybacks in the current year. If you look at our debt we have on the books right now, it's really about the buybacks we've done in the last 1.5 years. I would expect some additional buybacks as we go through 2016. How that plays out is going to be largely dependent on the marketplace. But our distribution business, by its nature, throws off a lot of cash. This year, our operating cash flow as we saw last year is just over 100% of earnings. And for a distribution business that throw off operating cash that's greater than the earnings, tells me that you didn't grow very well and you didn't that much working capital. So that gives us prospects for strong cash flow generation as we go into 2016. Frankly, I'd prefer to see a number in the upper 90s because they tell me we're growing there."

So the extent all these programs, the vending, these initiatives cause our average store size to grow, there's reason -- there's no reason why that won't enhance our profitability and fund any leakage we might have as it relates to the Onsite.

Because we think it's really about where is our business going long term. Thank you, and have a good day."

The -- 2015 was a tough year for our customers. As the year progressed and as we reported our various quarters, we touched on how that was playing out. And I think the best way to",2937,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. The -- 2015 was a tough year for our customers. As the year progressed and as we reported our various quarters, we touched on how that was playing out. And I think the best way to look at 2015 is to look at a subset of customers where we have a substantial market share presence with and that's our top 100 customers. That group represents about 24% of our revenues. And it isn't about that group and what's going on in that group, it's about what's going on there relative to what we've seen in the past. 
If I look at that top 100 group of customers and look at over the last 4 years, history says at any given point in time, 75% -- 75 of those 100 customers should be growing. And the reason that number is high as it is, is because of the growth drivers that Fastenal has at its disposal between our store operation, our vending operation and all the other things we can bring to our customer's table. 
In the first quarter this year, 72 of our top 100 customers grew. In the second quarter, that dropped to 63. In the third quarter, that dropped to 56. In the fourth quarter, that dropped to 49. So in the fourth quarter, half our top 100 customers grew and half contracted. In the month of December, to amplify that a little bit, 41 of our top 100 customers grew and 59 contracted. 
The next thing I looked at is try to gauge, of the customers that are contracting, how severe is their pain. And history says of the 25 that are contracting, about half of that number, about 13, will contract more than 10% and about half that number again, about 6, are going to contract more than 25%. And with that last group, that's really a sign of the severity of their pain and what's going on in their industry. We sell across the continent, around the planet. Most of our business is in North America and we sell to a lot of different industries. And when you start looking through the list of a lot of names that you recognize stand out and you can see the pain they're feeling in their business. 
In the first quarter, that 13 that are down more than 10% and the 6 that are down more than 25% looked like our numbers, we had 13 and 3% in that bucket. By the third quarter, that had slid to 32 of our customers that were down more than 10% and 17 of those were down more than 25%. 
After looking at that data in the third quarter, on our third quarter call in October, when Will and I went through our commentary on the quarter, I -- you could question the wisdom of the statement, but I made the statement that the industrial economy's in a recession and I used this as my reference point. Again, you could question the wisdom of saying it out loud. But in the fourth quarter, 37 of our top 100 customers were down more than 10%, 22 of that group were down more than 25%. There's one customer in that group where we did lose some business because of acquisition. Other than that, this is pain those customers are feeling as they progressed through calendar 2015. 
In the month of December -- November and December, I noted in the earnings release, we saw some shutdowns of our customers. We really saw it in the month of December. In the month of December, the Monday before Christmas, looking at the numbers and consulting with a few of our folks internally about what they were seeing in the trends, the trends looked a lot like 2014 in that the Monday before Christmas, I felt we had a very good chance of having sales being flat, December to December. And in the ensuing days, the balance of that week and then the week between Christmas and New Year, quickly saw that erode as customers were falling off in their business activity. And we produced the number we reported this morning. 
The start of January, and again you could question the wisdom of making this commentary with -- as of yesterday, our month of January is trending to it looks like there's a potential for us to be positive in the month of January. A lot can change between now and the end of the month, as we saw in the month December. We don't have holidays, but we do have weather. But as of the 14th, we are trending in a pattern that looks like we should be able to tread water or be slightly positive and time will tell how that plays out.
The next item probably of note in the earnings release is our gross margin. Long-term trends that we've talked about on previous calls that we talked about on our Investor Day in early November are unchanged. One thing we did see in the quarter and it was most acute in November and December, as our customers were tightening their belts, we saw a layer of transactions just evaporate from our business. And the layered transactions -- if you look at our business, there is stuff that we sell every day. Vending is a perfect example of products we sell every day through our store operations, through our regular sales channel, through our bin stocking and our OEM stocking. There are products that we sell every week and every month. 
There's also a subset of products that we sell on a less frequent basis, some of those out of our stores, some of those out of our distribution centers. A piece of that -- a layer of that transaction disappeared and that's higher-margin business for us and our gross margin drop was largely attributed to that disappearing. That's the bad news. The good news, I believe, we did not see a structural change in our gross margin. Time will tell if that layer returns and how much it returns. I am hopeful and expecting that it largely will. 
On the expense side, this is -- I officially became CEO on January 1 of this year from a practical standpoint after the board informed me of the decision meaning I was stepping in the role in mid-October. Will and I tagged team it a bit, but this quarter was largely under my watch. And I think from an expense standpoint, we frankly did a mediocre job and I put that squarely on my shareholders. Full-time and part-time expense trends and I'm looking at -- our biggest expense on the P&L after cost of goods is people. We have just over 20,000 employees.
The fourth quarter and the seasonality of our business is no secret to anybody who owns our stock and it's no secret to anybody who works at Fastenal. In 2014, if I look at our expense trends for full-time headcount from Q3 to Q4, we managed it well. There's always some attrition in the business. We try not to replace that attrition in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of last year, our full-time dollars paid, and this is base pay only, dropped about 0.3%. Our part-time, we can manage hours quite well. And as we typically go into the post-Thanksgiving season, we see our expense falling off because there's less work to do and therefore we need fewer hours. In last year, from Q3 to Q4, our expense dropped about 13.5% for our part-time labor. In total our expense was down about 2.5%, 2.4% to be exact. 
In 2015, full-time headcount crept up a little bit to 3.6 -- it increased about 3.5%. Our part-time dropped about 4.5%. I'm throwing a lot of percentages out here and it's not about the percentages and quite frankly it's not even about the expense itself. It's about managing the business through the seasonality of the year and we could have done a better job.
In total, our labor costs were down from Q3 to Q4, but that's really more of a function of when we don't do a good job, the leaders of our business at the district, the region, at the national level as well as our support areas, feel the impact of that in their bonus program. Our bonus programs are largely mechanically produced numbers. And so our overall expenses were down despite the fact we didn't manage the expense well, but they could have been down more. 
The message I've conveyed to our regional and national leadership is right now we are in an uncertain economy. We made substantial investments in calendar 2015. We added about 1,700 people into our stores. We added about 2,300 people into our organization in general. We are well staffed. To that end, I would expect our headcount to not grow between now and March 31. As we see some stabilization, assuming we see some stabilization and we believe there's reason for that belief to be there, as we see stabilization, we'll revisit our willingness to make investments in both store and support areas as we go into the new year.
If I look at the rest of our SG&A expense, we did a nice job on the occupancy side. The increase in that area was solely related to vending. As I've talked about in the past, I see that as a good expense increase because we know vending, where it touches our business, improves our interaction, our interface, our engagement with our customer and improves our growth. 
For those of you that -- I'm approaching this conference call in the vein of I have stepped out of my CEO role and I'm stepping into the CEO role, so I'm trying to avoid the weeds as much as possible, probably got into it a bit with the last few sets of numbers. Some things, it's hard to change habits. 
I will point out one thing. If you look at expense trends, a history, I said, from Q4 to Q1. We're going into winter. The last week here in Minnesota it's been sub 0 so winter is definitely here. I typically expect to see our utilities increase about $2.3 million from Q4 to Q1, and that's solely related to heating locations, thought I'd throw that out there for those of you that find that of interest.
We also had an item that we highlighted -- or several items we highlighted in the positives and negatives of our earnings release. We made the decision -- and we had been bouncing this around for a number of months -- a number of quarters, excuse me, but we made the decision to close down our joint venture manufacturing facility -- or to exit participating in our joint venture manufacturing facility in Brazil. We had several other disputes unrelated to that, that we also resolved during the quarter. The tally of all those items was about a $4 million impact to the quarter. I thought it was worth noting, again, in for what it's worth department. 
Finally, let's talk about 2016 and some of the things we had told you to prepare for 2016. At our Investor Day in early November, we had a great participation. For those of you that made it, thank you for attending, for those of you that had the opportunity to listen to it, I hope you found it informative. 
We really focused on 4 items that day. The one was our FAST Solutions, our industrial vending program. That's not new to everybody and we've grown that business wonderfully over the last 5 years. We're very excited about that business. And when I look at that business today, about 45% of our districts in the company have more than 200 machines in their business scattered across 10, 11, 12 stores. We made the decision that at this stage in our Fastenal vending business, we wanted to place more dedicated resources within our districts to support that business and really challenge them in a two-pronged attack. The first one was what we call the optimizing of our machines, and that's really looking at the data across these 200 machines, 300 machines, 100 machines, depending on the district you're looking at, looking at those machines and optimizing the machines. The math is really quite simple when you think about our helix machines and most our machines out there are helix, and that is if we want a machine to do, pick a number, $1,500 a month and every time a coil spins, on average it drops $5 worth of product. That means in the course of a month, we need to spin the coil 300 times in that machine. 20 days in the month, 15 times a day a coil needs to spin. And we need to look at the products in that machine and say, can we get 15 spins a day. If we can, we know we have a home run. If we can't, we need to work to optimize the machine. And that's what we're doing right now. 
When we spoke to you in early November, about 11% of our machines across the company had been optimized already. As of the end of December, that number's up to 18%. And the team that is driving that, clearly it's everybody in the organization. It's the folks in the stores, it's our district managers, it's our regional leaders, it's folks involved in our vending program. But the actual dedicated team, we started the quarter with about 60 individuals. We added just over 130. So we have about 191. Our goal is to get to about 230 people to support our 260 district managers in North America. And the way we pay for that group is through optimization and we're 18% of the way complete. But we have a ways to go. 
After they get that piece, their next prong of attack will be helping to grow our signings, helping to grow that business. It's a wonderful business. It's a business when you truly inform your customer what it's about, it sells itself. 
The second half that we talk about is related to vending in our November Investor Day, centered on the use of what we call our vending tab, and that's really about the efficiencies behind the scene. About 13% of our stores we're using the vending tab and it's really how we replenish the machines and how automated that process becomes. As of the end of December, we're at 29% of our stores are now using the vending tab. 
The second item we talked about was a relatively new concept for us to talk openly about externally and that was our Onsite program. History has said we'll add about 9 a year. It's a program where we take a store and we essentially set up a store on-site inside the customer's facility and it takes engagement one step further, even deeper than vending does. It changes the relationship with the customer. In the current year, we signed 82 Onsites. Again, our average was 9. Those 82 Onsites came from 71 districts in the company, so it means presumably 10 people signed 2. Those districts grew double digits. And so in 2015, the company grew 3.5% roughly for the year. The 71 districts on it, if you average the group out, grew double digits in 2015 because they had a means to combat what the economy was doing to them. They grew their business, they took market share at a faster pace. 
Our goal as we enter 2015 -- 2016, excuse me, is to 200. We -- in the first -- as of -- through Wednesday of this week, we have signed 5 this month. If you had to take that to the month, it would imply a run rate of about 12 or 13 for the month. If you had to take that times 12, it would imply a number just under 150. We have little ways to go, but I think we're off to a good start and I'm optimistic what this means for 2016, but as importantly for '17, '18 and '19 and '20. 
This customer-specific business, if I take our Onsites, add to it what we call our strategic account stores, which is an Onsite that's just down the street or near the customer, but not physically in the building. If you add these all together, it's about 16% of our business today. I'm very optimistic about what this can be in the future because with our low-cost model we're uniquely designed as a business to go after. 
The third item we touched on in November was e-commerce, our 2016 plans centered on our website rollout for Canada and then ultimately the U.S. That's not really a 2016 story, that's more of a 2017 story, but we wanted to provide an update on things that are in the works as it relates to the e-commerce strategy. 
And finally, we talked mostly about CSP 2016. That is a remerchandising of our stores. We converted about 800 stores to this format in the fourth quarter. We intend to do a similar number in the first. And really, it's about positioning our store locations to be even better equipped, that same-day service and efficient replenishment for our customers and we're excited about what that means for our future.
With that, I will open it up to Q&A. Thank you."

One thing I've always said over the years is our -- the history in this business -- for  Fastenal's business, that is, that the trends from January to October are the trends that really matter. November and December are months you go through, but history has said they're never really indicative of anything. We saw some patterns in November and December I thought that were worth noting, but I don't think there's anything that we've learned in the last 2 months that tell us if it's spreading, if it's stabilized other than what we saw with 10 days left in December and what we're seeing in the first 8 days or so of January. And again, I throw it out of there only because when there's more uncertainty, I do believe and I've always believed this that we have an obligation to maybe share a little more insight. And so we're trying to share as much as we can, but always mindful of the fact that the month can change on a dime. One of the reasons we had never talked about January in the January call or we've done it very infrequently is that we're always wrong. The question is how much.

We have -- I believe, 58 of the 82 are operational as of December because some of them we just signed in November and December. And like a vending machine, you sign it in November, it might take you 60 days, 90 days to turn it on. It's about -- to me, it's about momentum and -- but as far as what it means for the year, my belief of these growth drivers and what they mean for calendar 2016 is completely unchanged from what I believed in November. A lot of what -- what I believe is -- I'm very a practical person and what I believe is based on what I see in fact. And what I see in fact is a tremendous advantage we have. In the pieces we talked about in November, whether it be vending or Onsite, Fastenal is uniquely situated to go after those 2 businesses unlike any other company out there because one of the things that I always tell our folks internally and I try to remember myself is, in a world where everybody's talking about building the last mile in this online world, we're a company that's built the last mile already. It's a very efficient last mile. And how can we take that last mile, take our employees at the store, take our employees that are supporting the store and together grow a great business.

I guess where we really wanted to focus was just on the gross margin commentary in the release. You mentioned that substantially, I think was the word, all the year-over-year decline was on this lower discretionary spend, yet you also in that paragraph talked about pressures from lower rebates and mix and deflation. So if it's all from lower discretionary spend, it doesn't seem to leave much room for those other factors. So I'm curious, like what the commentary is really kind of on gross margin. And especially going forward, is there any reason to think that the trend will change in '16 versus what we saw in '15?"

And our team that really challenges our gross margin and finds opportunities for us to improve it had a lengthy discussion with them over the last few weeks. And after them providing us with a dizzying amount of data, I just said, you know what, what really happened? Did our gross margin structurally change? Or is there more to it? Because the usual suspects are still there. There's always a nominal impact in the fourth quarter based on what's going on with our rebates, what's going on with the utilization of our trucking network. The same trucks are running in November and December that are running in October and September, but they're carrying fewer packages, so you'll always have some leakage there in our gross margin. And depending on the year, if it's a strong year, you get a little lift from some of the supplier allowances. In some years, you get a little drag. So those are the usual suspects. The wild card in it is there were a layer of transactions that just disappeared. And they disappeared, we saw them disappear in both November and December and that was shining through in our gross margin and that really was the cause of our gross margin change. I honestly don't know if that layer comes back in January and February. I don't know if the belts are really tight and it's not going to come back for a few months, or this is stuff that was needed and people were towards the end of their fiscal year and they just turned off the spigots and they closed their PO books and they didn't buy anything. History -- I'm a firm believer that trends have meaning. And if history says these transactions are there because the business needs them over time, I believe they'll return it, I don't believe it's structural. But only time will tell."

The CapEx, as we talked about in early November, we came in on a net basis because we sold our old distribution center up in Kitchener, so we had some proceeds there. But on a net basis, we spent about $145 million on CapEx in 2015, which was about a 15% drop from what we'd seen in 2014, which was about 8%, 9% drop from what we saw in 2013. And really what had happened is in -- back in 2011 time frame, we had an Investor Day and we talked about how our CapEx was going to be going up. History has said our CapEx should be somewhere between 25% and 30% of our earnings, that was pretty good accurate number over a decade. And we noted that for a multiyear period, that number was going to materially go up and the 2 things that were really going to drive that increase centered on we were putting automation into our distribution centers, and today, over 80% of our picking activity occurs in automated distribution centers. The most meaningful project we have going right now we're placing -- we're adding automation into our distribution center in North Carolina. That's a 2016 project. But we were going to have about a 3-year period where we will put in a massive amount of automation and that came with the price tag. And so that is largely behind us. This year, our CapEx relates to the facility center on the North Carolina facility I talked about and then investments in Indianapolis related to manufacturing and expansion of our automated warehouse. The other piece was we were very optimistic about what vending could be and we knew that we were going to be spending a tremendous amount of dollars on vending over a multiyear period. Two, we felt very good about the ability for us to grow the business. And the second half of that equation is we didn't want to run out of supply, so we built in inventory machines. And so today, our spend is coming down in both of those largely because the automation is behind us. And then on a vending standpoint, our patterns are more stable today and we're able to burn in a little bit of that inventory as well. So all those pieces, we identified in November and expectation that CapEx would drop probably around 12% to just under $130 million. And the only wild card on that centers on the things that we -- the pace of what we do with vending as we go through the year. There are some things I'm optimistic about and we'll see how they play out, but that's probably the only wild card whereas the rest of the projects are pretty well known at this vantage point. Dividend, we just announced a $0.30 dividend last night. We've been running at $0.28. So if that were to continue throughout the year, that would imply about a $344 million dividend versus the $327 million last year based on where our share count is right now. And then the wild card is what we do in buybacks. We did a fair amount of buybacks in the current year. If you look at our debt we have on the books right now, it's really about the buybacks we've done in the last 1.5 years. I would expect some additional buybacks as we go through 2016. How that plays out is going to be largely dependent on the marketplace. But a distribution business, by its nature, throws off a lot of cash. This year, our operating cash flow as we saw last year is just over 100% of earnings. And for a distribution business that throw off operating cash that's greater than the earnings tells me that in the year it didn't grow very well and you didn't need that much in working capital. So that gives us prospects for strong cash flow generation as we go into 2016. Frankly, I'd prefer to see a number in the upper 90s because that'd tell me we're growing better."

And we were -- we're at 9 -- I see we're at 9:46, and so Ryan, I'm going to have to ask you to, if there's a follow-on, that we'll take it off-line. One rule we've always had is we realize it's earnings season and everybody has a very, very busy day. And so we try to hold this call to 45 minutes. So I guess, I'd close on that note of, again, thank you to everybody for listening to our earnings call this morning. Hope you didn't mind hearing just my voice. In the past, it's typically been 2. Felt it was appropriate to talk a bit about the quarter, but more importantly to talk about the growth drivers we have going into 2016 because that's why we held the Investor Day back in November, because we think it's really about where is our business going long term. Thank you, and have a good day."

The -- 2015 was a tough year for our customers. As the year progressed and as we reported our various quarters, we touched on how that was playing out. And I think the best way to",2942,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. The -- 2015 was a tough year for our customers. As the year progressed and as we reported our various quarters, we touched on how that was playing out. And I think the best way to look at 2015 is to look at a subset of customers where we have a substantial market share presence with, and that's our top 100 customers. That group represents about 24% of our revenues. And it isn't about that group and what's going on in that group, it's about what's going on there relative to what we've seen in the past. 
If I look at that top 100 group of customers and look at it over the last 4 years, history says at any given point in time, 75% -- 75 of those 100 customers should be growing. And the reason that number is high as it is, is because of the growth drivers that Fastenal has at its disposal between our store operation, our vending operation and all the other things we can bring to our customer's table. 
In the first quarter this year, 72 of our top 100 customers grew. In the second quarter, that dropped to 63. In the third quarter, that dropped to 56. In the fourth quarter, that dropped to 49. So in the fourth quarter, half our top 100 customers grew and half contracted. In the month of December, to amplify that a little bit, 41 of our top 100 customers grew and 59 contracted. 
The next thing I looked at is try to gauge, of the customers that are contracting, how severe is their pain. And history says of the 25 that are contracting, about half of that number, about 13, will contract more than 10% and about half that number again, about 6, are going to contract more than 25%. And with that last group, that's really a sign of the severity of their pain and what's going on in their industry. We sell across the continent, around the planet. Most of our business is in North America, and we sell to a lot of different industries. And when you start looking through the list, a lot of names that you recognize stand out and you can see the pain they're feeling in their business. 
In the first quarter, that 13 that are down more than 10% and the 6 that are down more than 25% looked like our numbers, we had 13 and 3 in that bucket. By the third quarter, that had slid to 32 of our customers that were down more than 10% and 17 of those were down more than 25%. 
After looking at that data in the third quarter, on our third quarter call in October, when Will and I went through our commentary on the quarter, I -- you could question the wisdom of the statement, but I made the statement that the industrial economy's in a recession, and I used this as my reference point. Again, you could question the wisdom of saying it out loud. But in the fourth quarter, 37 of our top 100 customers were down more than 10%, 22 of that group were down more than 25%. There's one customer in that group where we did lose some business because of acquisition. Other than that, this is pain those customers are feeling as they progressed through calendar 2015. 
In the month of December -- November and December, I noted in the earnings release, we saw some shutdowns of our customers. We really saw it in the month of December. In the month of December, the Monday before Christmas, looking at the numbers and consulting with a few of our folks internally about what they were seeing in the trends, the trends looked a lot like 2014 in that the Monday before Christmas, I felt we had a very good chance of having sales being flat, December to December. And in the ensuing days, the balance of that week and then the week between Christmas and New Year, quickly saw that erode as customers were falling off in their business activity. And we produced the number we reported this morning. 
The start of January, and again you could question the wisdom of making this commentary with -- as of yesterday, our month of January is trending to it looks like there's a potential for us to be positive in the month of January. A lot can change between now and the end of the month, as we saw in the month of December. We don't have holidays, but we do have weather. But as of the 14th, we are trending in a pattern that looks like we should be able to tread water or be slightly positive, and time will tell how that plays out.
The next item probably of note in the earnings release is our gross margin. Long-term trends that we've talked about on previous calls, that we talked about on our Investor Day in early November, are unchanged. One thing we did see in the quarter, and it was most acute in November and December, as our customers were tightening their belts, we saw a layer of transactions just evaporate from our business. And the layered transactions -- if you look at our business, there is stuff that we sell every day. Vending is a perfect example of products we sell every day through our store operations, through our regular sales channel, through our bin stocking and our OEM stocking. There are products that we sell every week and every month. 
There's also a subset of products that we sell on a less frequent basis, some of those out of our stores, some of those out of our distribution centers. A piece of that -- a layer of that transaction disappeared and that's higher-margin business for us, and our gross margin drop was largely attributed to that disappearing. That's the bad news. The good news, I believe, we did not see a structural change in our gross margin. Time will tell if that layer returns and how much it returns. I am hopeful and expecting that it largely will. 
On the expense side, this is -- I officially became CEO on January 1 of this year from a practical standpoint, after the board informed me of the decision meaning -- I was stepping in the role in mid-October. Will and I tagged team it a bit, but this quarter was largely under my watch. And I think from an expense standpoint, we frankly did a mediocre job and I put that squarely on my shareholders. Full-time and part-time expense trends and I'm looking at -- our biggest expense on the P&L, after cost of goods, is people. We have just over 20,000 employees.
The fourth quarter and the seasonality of our business is no secret to anybody who owns our stock, and it's no secret to anybody who works at Fastenal. In 2014, if I look at our expense trends for full-time headcount from Q3 to Q4, we managed it well. There's always some attrition in the business. We try not to replace that attrition in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of last year, our full-time dollars paid, and this is base pay only, dropped about 0.3%. Our part-time, we can manage hours quite well. And as we typically go into the post-Thanksgiving season, we see our expense falling off because there's less work to do and therefore, we need fewer hours. In last year, from Q3 to Q4, our expense dropped about 13.5% for our part-time labor. In total, our expense was down about 2.5%, 2.4% to be exact. 
In 2015, full-time headcount crept up a little bit to 3.6 -- it increased about 3.5%. Our part-time dropped about 4.5%. I'm throwing a lot of percentages out here and it's not about the percentages, and quite frankly it's not even about the expense itself. It's about managing the business through the seasonality of the year, and we could have done a better job.
In total, our labor costs were down from Q3 to Q4, but that's really more of a function of when we don't do a good job, the leaders of our business at the district, the region, at the national level as well as our support areas, feel the impact of that in their bonus program. Our bonus programs are largely mechanically produced numbers. And so our overall expenses were down despite the fact we didn't manage the expense well, but they could have been down more. 
The message I've conveyed to our regional and national leadership is, right now, we are in an uncertain economy. We made substantial investments in calendar 2015. We added about 1,700 people into our stores. We added about 2,300 people into our organization in general. We are well staffed. To that end, I would expect our headcount to not grow between now and March 31. As we see some stabilization, assuming we see some stabilization, and we believe there's reason for that belief to be there, as we see stabilization, we'll revisit our willingness to make investments in both store and support areas as we go into the new year.
If I look at the rest of our SG&A expense, we did a nice job on the occupancy side. The increase in that area was solely related to vending. As I've talked about in the past, I see that as a good expense increase because we know vending, where it touches our business, improves our interaction, our interface, our engagement with our customer and improves our growth. 
For those of you that -- I'm approaching this conference call in the vein of I have stepped out of my CFO role and I'm stepping into the CEO role, so I'm trying to avoid the weeds as much as possible, probably got into it a bit with the last few sets of numbers. Some things, it's hard to change habits. 
I will point out one thing. If you look at expense trends, a history, I said, from Q4 to Q1. We're going into winter. The last week here in Minnesota it's been sub 0, so winter is definitely here. I typically expect to see our utilities increase about $2.3 million from Q4 to Q1, and that's solely related to heating locations, thought I'd throw that out there for those of you that find that of interest.
We also had an item that we highlighted -- or several items we highlighted in the positives and negatives of our earnings release. We made the decision -- and we had been bantering this around for a number of months -- a number of quarters, excuse me, but we made the decision to close down our joint venture manufacturing facility -- or to exit participating in our joint venture manufacturing facility in Brazil. We had several other disputes unrelated to that, that we also resolved during the quarter. The tally of all those items was about a $4 million impact to the quarter. I thought it was worth noting, again, in the ""for what it's worth"" department. 
Finally, let's talk about 2016 and some of the things we had told you to prepare for 2016. At our Investor Day in early November, we had a great participation. For those of you that made it, thank you for attending. For those of you that had the opportunity to listen to it, I hope you found it informative. 
We really focused on 4 items that day. The one was our FAST Solutions, our industrial vending program. That's not new to anybody, and we've grown that business wonderfully over the last 5 years. We're very excited about that business. And when I look at that business today, about 45% of our districts in the company have more than 200 machines in their business, scattered across 10, 11, 12 stores. We made the decision that at this stage in our Fastenal vending business, we wanted to place more dedicated resources within our districts to support that business and really challenge them in a two-pronged attack. The first one was what we call the optimizing of our machines, and that's really looking at the data across these 200 machines, 300 machines, 100 machines, depending on the district you're looking at, looking at those machines and optimizing the machines. The math is really quite simple when you think about our helix machines, and most our machines out there are helix, and that is if we want a machine to do, pick a number, $1,500 a month, and every time a coil spins, on average it drops $5 worth of product, that means in the course of a month, we need to spin the coil 300 times in that machine. 20 days in the month, 15 times a day a coil needs to spin. And we need to look at the product that's in that machine and say, ""Can we get 15 spins a day?"" If we can, we know we have a home run. If we can't, we need to work to optimize the machine. And that's what we're doing right now. 
When we spoke to you in early November, about 11% of our machines across the company had been optimized already. As of the end of December, that number's up to 18%. And the team that is driving that -- clearly it's everybody in the organization. It's the folks in the stores, it's our district managers, it's our regional leaders, it's folks involved in our vending program. But the actual dedicated team, we started the quarter with about 60 individuals. We added just over 130. So we have about 191. Our goal is to get to about 230 people to support our 260 district managers in North America. And the way we pay for that group is through optimization, and we're 18% of the way complete. But we have a ways to go. 
After they get that piece, their next prong of attack will be helping to grow our signings, helping to grow that business. It's a wonderful business. It's a business when you truly inform your customer what it's about, it sells itself. 
The second half that we talked about is related to vending in our November Investor Day, centered on the use of what we call our vending tab, and that's really about the efficiencies behind the scene. About 13% of our stores were using the vending tab, and it's really how we replenish the machines and how automated that process becomes. As of the end of December, we're at 29% of our stores are now using the vending tab. 
The second item we talked about was a relatively new concept for us to talk openly about externally, and that was our Onsite program. History has said we'll add about 9 a year. It's a program where we take a store and we essentially set up a store on-site, inside the customer's facility. And it takes engagement one step further, even deeper than vending does. It changes the relationship with the customer. In the current year, we signed 82 Onsites. Again, our average was 9. Those 82 Onsites came from 71 districts in the company, so it means presumably 10 people signed 2. Those districts grew double digits. And so in 2015, the company grew 3.5% roughly for the year. The 71 districts on it, if you average the group out, grew double digits in 2015 because they had a means to combat what the economy was doing to them. They grew their business, they took market share at a faster pace. 
Our goal as we enter 2015 -- 2016, excuse me, is to do 200. We -- in the first -- as of -- through Wednesday of this week, we have signed 5 this month. If you had to take that to the month, it would imply a run rate of about 12 or 13 for the month. If you had to take that times 12, it would imply a number just under 150. We have little ways to go, but I think we're off to a good start and I'm optimistic what this means for 2016, but as importantly, for '17, '18 and '19 and '20. 
This customer-specific business, if I take our Onsites, add to it what we call our strategic account stores, which is an Onsite that's just down the street or nearer the customer, but not physically in the building. If you add these all together, it's about 16% of our business today. I'm very optimistic about what this can be in the future because with our low-cost model, we're uniquely designed as a business to go after. 
The third item we touched on in November was e-commerce, our 2016 plans, centered on our website rollout for Canada and then ultimately the U.S. That's not really a 2016 story, that's more of a 2017 story, but we wanted to provide an update on things that are in the works as it relates to the e-commerce strategy. 
And finally, we talked about CSP 2016. That is a remerchandising of our stores. We converted about 800 stores to this format in the fourth quarter. We intend to do a similar number in the first. And really, it's about positioning our store locations to be even better equipped, that same-day service and efficient replenishment for our customers, and we're excited about what that means for our future.
With that, I will open it up to Q&A. Thank you."

One thing I've always said over the years is our -- the history in this business -- for Fastenal's business, that is, that the trends from January to October are the trends that really matter. November and December are months you go through, but history has said they're never really indicative of anything. We saw some patterns in November and December I thought that were worth noting, but I don't think there's anything that we've learned in the last 2 months that tell us if it's spreading, if it's stabilized, other than what we saw with 10 days left in December and what we're seeing in the first 8 days or so of January. And again, I throw it out there only because when there's more uncertainty, I do believe, and I've always believed this, that we have an obligation to maybe share a little more insight. And so we're trying to share as much as we can, but always mindful of the fact that the month can change on a dime. One of the reasons we had never talked about January in the January call, or we've done it very infrequently, is that we're always wrong. The question is how much. But I can't say that we know anything about the contagion."

And like a vending machine, you sign it in November, it might take you 60 days, 90 days to turn it on. It's about -- to me, it's about momentum and -- but as far as what it means for the year, my belief of these growth drivers and what they mean for calendar 2016 is completely unchanged from what I believed in November. A lot of what -- what I believe is -- I'm very a practical person, and what I believe is based on what I see in fact. And what I see in fact is a tremendous advantage we have. In the pieces we talked about in November, whether it be vending or Onsite, Fastenal is uniquely situated to go after those 2 businesses unlike any other company out there because one of the things that I always tell our folks internally, and I try to remember myself, is in a world where everybody's talking about building the last mile in this online world, we're a company that's built the last mile already. It's a very efficient last mile. And how can we take that last mile, take our employees at the store, take our employees that are supporting the store, and together grow a great business?

And our team that really challenges our gross margin and finds opportunities for us to improve it, had a lengthy discussion with them over the last few weeks. And after them providing us with a dizzying amount of data, I just said, ""You know what? What really happened? Did our gross margin structurally change? Or is there more to it?"" Because the usual suspects are still there. There's always a nominal impact in the fourth quarter based on what's going on with our rebates, what's going on with the utilization of our trucking network. The same trucks are running in November and December that are running in October and September, but they're carrying fewer packages, so you'll always have some leakage there in our gross margin. And depending on the year, if it's a strong year, you get a little lift from some of the supplier allowances. In some years, you get a little drag. So those are the usual suspects. The wild card in it is there were a layer of transactions that just disappeared. And they disappeared, we saw them disappear in both November and December, and that was shining through in our gross margin and that really was the cause of our gross margin change. I honestly don't know if that layer comes back in January and February. I don't know if the belts are really tight and it's not going to come back for a few months, or this is stuff that was needed and people were towards the end of their fiscal year and they just turned off the spigots and they closed their PO books and they didn't buy anything. History -- I'm a firm believer that trends have meaning. And if history says these transactions are there because the business needs them over time, I believe they'll return, and I don't believe it's structural. But only time will tell."

The CapEx, as we talked about in early November, we came in on a net basis -- because we sold our old distribution center up in Kitchener, so we had some proceeds there. But on a net basis, we spent about $145 million on CapEx in 2015, which was about a 15% drop from what we'd seen in 2014, which was about an 8%, 9% drop from what we saw in 2013. And really what had happened is in -- back in 2011 time frame, we had an Investor Day and we talked about how our CapEx was going to be going up. History has said our CapEx should be somewhere between 25% and 30% of our earnings. That was a pretty good, accurate number over a decade. And we noted that for a multiyear period, that number was going to materially go up. And the 2 things that were really going to drive that increase centered on we were putting automation into our distribution centers, and today, over 80% of our picking activity occurs in automated distribution centers. The most meaningful project we have going right now, we're placing -- we're adding automation into our distribution center in North Carolina. That's a 2016 project. But we were going to have about a 3-year period where we were putting in a massive amount of automation, and that came with a price tag. And so that is largely behind us. This year, our CapEx as it relates to facilities center on the North Carolina facility I talked about, and then investments in Indianapolis related to manufacturing and expansion of our automated warehouse. The other piece was we were very optimistic about what vending could be, and we knew that we were going to be spending a tremendous amount of dollars on vending over a multiyear period. Two, we felt very good about the ability for us to grow the business. And the second half of that equation is we didn't want to run out of supply, so we built in inventory machines. And so today, our spend is coming down in both of those, largely because the automation is behind us. And then on a vending standpoint, our patterns are more stable today and we're able to burn a little bit of that inventory as well. So all those pieces. We identified, in November, an expectation that CapEx would drop probably around 12% to just under $130 million. And the only wild card on that centers on the things that we -- the pace of what we do with vending as we go through the year. There are some things I'm optimistic about, and we'll see how they play out. But that's probably the only wild card, whereas the rest of the projects are pretty well known at this vantage point. Dividend, we just announced a $0.30 dividend last night. We've been running at $0.28. So if that were to continue throughout the year, that would imply about a $344 million dividend versus the $327 million last year, based on where our share count is right now. And then the wild card is what we do in buybacks. We did a fair amount of buybacks in the current year. If you look at our debt we have on the books right now, it's really about the buybacks we've done in the last 1.5 years. I would expect some additional buybacks as we go through 2016. How that plays out is going to be largely dependent on the marketplace. But a distribution business, by its nature, throws off a lot of cash. This year, our operating cash flow, as we saw last year, is just over 100% of earnings. And for a distribution business that throw off operating cash that's greater than the earnings, it tells me that in the year you didn't grow very well and you didn't need that much in working capital. So that gives us prospects for strong cash flow generation as we go into 2016. Frankly, I'd prefer to see a number in the upper 90s because that'd tell me we're growing better."

A new large National Account, the first few months are kind of tough. First 6 to 9 months, you're throwing resources at it. You aren't as good at sourcing the products, so your gross margin isn't where you'd like. If I look at the Onsites that we turned on in 2015, their performance would be materially different than the existing book, and that's what we talked about in November and that'd be true of every year. Again, it's really about -- I think at the end of the day the real question is, does it allow us to grow our business faster? And do you have confidence that Fastenal, if we're getting the growth, can manage the operating expenses? I believe we can manage the operating expenses if we're getting the growth. I believe these growth drivers allow us to grow faster and take market share at a faster clip than our competitors. 
And we were -- we're at 9 -- I see we're at 9:46, and so Ryan, I'm going to have to ask you to, if there's a follow-on, that we'll take it off-line. One rule we've always had is we realize it's earnings season and everybody has a very, very busy day. And so we try to hold this call to 45 minutes. So I guess, I'd close on that note of, again, thank you to everybody for listening to our earnings call this morning. Hope you didn't mind hearing just my voice. In the past, it's typically been 2. Felt it was appropriate to talk a bit about the quarter, but more importantly, to talk about the growth drivers we have going into 2016 because that's why we held the Investor Day back in November, because we think it's really about where is our business going long term.

Press release went out first thing this morning. Hopefully, you all saw as well, we put out a press release yesterday eve",2007,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining in on the first quarter 2016 Fastenal Company earnings call. Press release went out first thing this morning. Hopefully, you all saw as well, we put out a press release yesterday evening announcing our dividend, our second quarter dividend. 
In the quarter, we grew our sales about 3.5%. We had the benefit of additional business during the quarter, so on a daily basis, we grew about 2. Our earnings per share grew just over 2%, primarily driven by the fact we had bought a considerable amount of our stock in the last 15 months because our actual earnings were down slightly from a year ago. 
A bit of a noisy quarter in at that of the calendar had some stuff going on. We -- the daily number, which is what we typically report, can be influenced positively or negatively by the change from year-over-year and a number of business days in a calendar month. So in January, it was a 20-day month versus 21. February, we had an additional day so it was a 21 versus a 20, and in March, we had an additional day, so it was a 23 versus a 22. And March also had Easter, which had been in April in each of the last 2 years. 
I throw these into the equation because they can influence the number. So if you look at our numbers as reported in January, we grew at 3.3 daily average, February grew at 2.6. In March, we dropped to 0.0, so we basically had no growth in the final month of the quarter. 
If I factor in the change in days, I think of the month as being January, we grew between 2.5 and 3. February, we probably grew closer to 3. In March, we probably grew just under 1. If I add Easter into the equation, that March number probably is closer to a 2. And so I'll start to call by saying very pleased with the fact January and February, we started out with a nice improvement after really struggling through the fourth quarter and struggling through the fourth quarter and the latter 9 months of 2015 is more of a statement of what our customers were enduring as their business weakened, particularly those involved in oil and gas industry and those involved in export. But when I look at March, we're a little disappointed in the month. The month weakened as we get through it. Easter's part of it, the calendar's part of it but the month did weaken a little bit, and so it was a soft finish to the quarter.
If I -- there was really no other noise in the number because the acquisition we did last fall added about 8/10 of a percent to our number, and FX removed about 8/10. So other than the calendar, wasn't a lot of noise. 
Speaking of FX, really talking about our foreign business in general, one of the items that we touched on in the call centered on Canada. Canada has an economy that is very much influenced by commodities, particularly energy commodities, but commodities in general. That business for a lot of distributors had been struggling throughout 2015, ours included. In the fourth quarter, our business in Canada grew using local currencies removing the FX impact and local days, our business grew about 4%. I'm pleased to say that business improved in the first quarter and grew about 7%. I think that is probably a good teller of some underlying strength that we're seeing in that business and our execution.
From a P&L perspective, and this is a lot of the comments that I share the folks internally. Sometimes, you need to take a step back and look at what you've been investing in and what it translated into to help understand the puts and takes of your P&L. 
From 10,000 feet, the best way I can think about P&L is this. We added about $33 million in additional revenue from the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. As you see in our published statement, and you saw this in our fourth quarter and you saw it, quite frankly, throughout 2015, with the growth drivers we have in place, particularly in the large account emphasis within our growth drivers, the larger our customer gets typically, the lower the gross margin because in many cases, you're supplying a concentrated offering into a business, it's a more competitive landscape because it's more efficient landscape to operate. And so our gross margin in that business typically lower, but again it's more efficient, so our operating expenses are lower as well. So as we've seen great success in that business, we've seen some trade-off in gross margin. 
Also as we went through 2015, our fastener business was particularly hit by the slowdown in the economy, and so we had a some product mix as well as customer mix impacts to our margin.
And with the weaker environment, a very competitive landscape, so we did lose gross margin on a year-over-year basis. Our gross margin was largely in line with fourth quarter. And that $33 million in additional revenue translated into about $7 million of additional gross profit because of the contraction in gross margin.
We talked a lot in 2014, latter part of '14 and 2015 about adding people to our store base network. As we got later into the year, we also talked about slowing down the growth, and we've continued to that discussion of slowing down the growth of people. We think we're to a point where our stores are well staffed, and now we need to do business to catch up and quite frankly, get ahead of our headcount growth a bit. But in the last 12 months, we've added about $5 million -- -- excuse me, we've added about $12 million of additional payroll expense because of all the people we've added. Because a lot of high percentage of our compensation is incentive-based, if I look at incentive compensation at the district, regional, national, local level as well as profit-sharing contributions, those are down on a year-over-year basis, and so about $7 million of the $12 million was funded by our collective group of employees, and our payroll expenses are up about $5 million in total against $7 million additional gross profit. 
We also been heavily investing in vending, heavily investing in Onsite, heavily investing in growth drivers and our operating expenses outside of payroll are up $5 million. So total expenses are up about $10 million year-over-year, and our earnings down about $3 million. We took on some debts into the last year, 1.5 years to fund the buyback of the stock options -- excuse me, stock. So our interest expense is up about $1 million. So our earnings are down just under $4 million a year ago. 
When I look at the investments we've made in people and the investments we made in growth drivers to our business, I believe they're great investments for our  business short term and long term. However, we don't have the gross profit dollars in the short term to pay for it, and that's why we're holding tight on headcount as we go into the year and also why you'll notice that we softened a bit our store opening expectations for the year.
Last year, we cited a range of 60 to 75. We pulled that down to a range of 40 to 60 while still meaningful number stores opened, we really felt given that top of the growth drivers that we had in place there was a wise decision to slow that down a little bit. 
Last November, we had an Investor Day. In that Investor Day, we really talked about 4 primary things. They centered on vending, our industrial vending deployment, talked about Onsite where we set up a store inside the 4 walls of our customer. We talked about e-commerce, investments we're making to make it easier for our customers interact with us, and we talk about what we call CSP 2016, and that was expanding the merchandising that we have locally in our store to improve our ability to fulfill on a same-day basis, to improve the spectrum of customers we would appeal to, to frankly to improve our business. When I look at our progress on those, I'm extremely pleased with what we have done not only in the fourth quarter, but what we've done in the first quarter. 
From a vending perspective, we really talked about the team we were adding. So we added about 230 people to drive the optimization of our vending, to drive the signing of our vending and to drive the efficiency of vending. 
When I look at where we are at the end of March, about 60% of our machines have now been optimized. When we talk about it last November at Investor Day, we were at about 11. So we've made great progress on that, and really what it translates into is a better utilization of our vending platform within our customer business, but also a better value proposition for our customer because we know part of that go through a vending machine lowers the consumption, lowers the waste and lowers the expense for our customer. And we think that's a winning combination in our business. 
About 80% of our store locations used the vending tab, and what that is, and we talked about this in our Investor Day, that is a better integration of the vending within our own point-of-sale platform. It helps our store personnel be more efficient with replenishments, it helps streamline supply chain, and we've made great progress on that, and it's going to serve as well as we go into 2016 and beyond. 
As important to those 2 pieces, our pace of signings improved. In the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2015, we signed roughly 4,000 vending devices. In the first quarter, that number improved. We signed about 4,700. So I think we're off to a great start, and that's an important growth driver to our business.
In the case of Onsite, last year, we signed about 82 Onsites. Our historical run rate or pace of annual signing was about 9. So we took a big leap forward in 2015. In fall of '15, at our Investor Day, we talked about a lofty goal. We said our goal is 200 signings of Onsites in 2016. In the first quarter, we signed 48. Frankly, that's a number better than I was expecting. I was very hopeful coming into the year we have a number that would start with a 4 that was a big step-up from the run rate we had in the latter half of 2015. Our team came through and worked with our customers and signed additional 48 those will turn on as we go through the year, but I'm very optimistic about our Onsite program as we go through the balance of the year. 
E-commerce, as I mentioned, is more about the ease of customer ability to interact, more updates on that on future meetings. That's more of when I think about a late '16, '17, '18 type of item. 
And then finally CSP 2016, we made a hard push late in the year. We continue to that hard push. We currently have just under 1,000 locations converted to the CSP '16 format. And I believe we get to the end of the second quarter, that number will be closer to a 1,700 or 1,800 number that are substantially converted, which position us well not only for the efficiency of our business, but our ability to appeal to a broader reach of customers and fulfill their needs as we go into the summer.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Sheryl to talk a little bit more in detail about the quarter."

I'm going to provide an update on our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015.

Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015. The operating cash flow is slightly lower in the first quarter of 2016 due to our current initiative to add additional products into our store inventory under our CSP '16 format. 
The Q1 operating cash flow is also benefited by minimal tax payments occurring in the first quarter. That will reverse itself in the second, third and fourth quarter of the year. 
Our operational working capital year-over-year inventory growth was approximately $97 million. The main drivers of the increase in the inventory were driven by the CSP '16 initiatives, which was approximately 35% of the increase. International inventory growth and the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. contributed approximately another 25% of the increase, and then the last main driver was the Onsite and large customer impacts, which were approximately an increase of 10%. 
We also disclosed in our earnings release that we had previously indicated our net capital expenditures would be approximately $128 million in 2016. We now believe given the new vending locker lease agreement and the strong start to vending signings in the first quarter that we will have total net capital expenditures of approximately $197 million to $200 million in 2016. 
We do plan to fund this increase as well as some of our previously planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of proposed private placement of debt. 
During the first quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share for a total of approximately $59 million. And during the last 7 quarters, we have purchased 8.7 million shares of our stock or approximately $396 million worth of stock, which represents about 3.3% of our outstanding shares from the start of this time frame.
As Dan mentioned earlier, last night, we announced a dividend of $0.30 per share. This will be our second quarter dividend for the year. So we have strong cash flow, and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year. 
And with that, I will open it up to questions from the group."

The districts that did not are growing low single digit.

We really saw the stabilization start to occur in the February, March time frame from the standpoint what was going on with gross margin. So I really believe when I look at to the balance of the year, 50% is probably a better target. When I look out long term, it's really going to be a function more of how successful we are with the Onsite program because that will materially change longer term our customer mix. But it's a very, very attractive ability to grow the business long term and the operating leverage long term."

The -- when I think of vending, you're dead on with your comment or your question and comment about vending is really about our nonfastener business.

The -- when I think of vending, you're dead on with your comment or your question and comment about vending is really about our nonfastener business. Vending really isn't used for dispensing of fasteners. Now there are some expenses of vending over time how our bin stocks or things like that will include -- will incorporate essentially some of the vending-type technology for replenishment cycle, but a vending us about nonfasteners. And so we've done a great job deploying vending to our existing customers over the last 5 years, and the fastener piece is about their economic activity and our ability to take market share. And I think the story when I look at the fastener piece is about economic activity. The nonfastener piece is about the activity and our ability to grow and deploy vending. So we can have a customer whose business in the fastener -- in the fastener piece is down because we have a great market penetration already, and their business is just off. But we can grow the nonfastener piece because of vending because we're deploying a better supply chain to our customer. Because when I think about our deal with our customer and what our customer truly needs, put yourself in the shoes of the purchasing manager, the plant manager. They live in a world where there's constant demands on at them from improvement. They're working with fewer resources everyday. So what they need from their supplier isn't just great fulfillment. I think that's the starting point. They need a better supply chain partner. In the case of vending, in the case of bin stock, in the case of our Onsite model, we're a better supply chain partner, and we highlight this point because it demonstrates that even in a weak economy, we can grow our business because we are a better supply chain partner for our customer."

But when I think of what are some of the positives, in the fourth quarter, that was probably as appeared as you could see, and I was not hesitant to share my thoughts on it during the fourth quarter. But our fasteners, as an example, were down about 6% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, they are down around 2%. Our nonfasteners were struggling in the fourth quarter, and I don't have the exact stat in front of me -- I'm sorry, but if they improved to mid-single digits, upper single digits, in the first quarter. And so we saw, generally speaking, an improvement in our business, and that's, I think, what we're really talking about. I think what we see is the business in January, February and I can't quite say that for March, but January, February felt more like we were in October. And I think if I look at the last 5 or 6 months, I really do think that the outliers was the extreme weakness we saw in November, December, and I think that was a function of companies just shutting down around the holidays more extensively than normal. March, only April and May start to answer for us what really happened in March."

One, our growth is primarily coming from large account, and that deepened as we went through the year. It's primarily coming from -- if I think of our sales number and the weakness, when you -- we've done a nice job assigning customers both Onsite and traditional and national account customer that aren't Onsite. When you're doing a nice job taking market share, you're turning on a lot of new business, and a lot of times you're turning on a lot of new business, you do get some short-term mix issues going on in that you -- a new large customer isn't at average margins for that group on day 1 because it takes you time 6, 9 and 12 months to work through some of the hiccups of the system of finding the best supply, finding the best match for item when you're turning on the business. And typically, you have your existing business that, that is supporting that because that existing business, you've done a better job of improving your supply chain already. If you think of what's really hurting us right now is from a revenue and revenue growth perspective, we're doing a wonderful job signing new national. We're doing a wonderful job signing Onsites. We're doing a wonderful job signing vending and growing those pieces of the business. So we're taking market share at a very good clip. What's causing us to struggle is our existing book of business, our existing customers are struggling in a weak environment. And so the more mature component of our business is going backwards, and that more mature piece has -- because if I had a customer -- excuse me, for 2 or 3 years, I've already in many cases established a lot of the best parts, a lot of the best source of supply to serve the customers' needs, and that's in my mix, and that make sense is weakened right now. So that's a piece of it. The other piece of it is on the execution standpoint, we slip a little bit as we went through 2015. We slipped a little bit on the freight, how we are on our freight expense versus our freight that we charge to customer. Part of that, I think, it became more difficult for our to operate effectively given that fuel prices were lower. Fuel prices is an important part of our distribution cost, but it's not the only component. But it might make it harder for you to charge freight on this item or that. And the fact that it's a weak environment, it's a competitive marketplace. I feel we're at that point where our gross margins are stable from a sequential standpoint, but that still is painful process on a year-over-year basis, there's no question about that."

270747,329152839,958287,"Fastenal Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2016",2016-04-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining in on the First Quarter 2016 Fastenal Company Earnings Call. Press release went out first thing this morning. Hopefully, you all saw as well, we put out a press release yesterday even",2025,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining in on the First Quarter 2016 Fastenal Company Earnings Call. Press release went out first thing this morning. Hopefully, you all saw as well, we put out a press release yesterday evening announcing our dividend -- our second quarter dividend. 
In the quarter, we grew our sales about 3.5%. We had the benefit of additional business day during the quarter. So on a daily basis, we grew about 2 %. Our earnings per share grew just over 2%, primarily driven by the fact we bought a considerable amount of our stock in the last 15 months because our actual earnings were down slightly from a year ago.
A bit of a noisy quarter in that the calendar had some stuff going on. We -- the daily number, which is what we typically report, can be influenced positively or negatively by the change from year-over-year and the number of business days in a calendar month. So in January, it was a 20-day month versus 21. February, we had an additional day, so it was a 21 versus a 20. And in March, we had an additional day, so it was a 23 versus a 22. And March also had Easter, which had been in April in each of the last 2 years.
I throw all these into the equation because they can influence the number. So if you look at our numbers as reported in January, we grew at 3.3 daily average, February grew at 2.6. In March, we dropped to 0.0, so we basically had no growth in the final month of the quarter.
If I factor in the change in days, I think of the month as being January, we grew between 2.5 and 3. February, we probably grew closer to 3. In March, we probably grew just under 1. If I add Easter into the equation, that March number probably is closer to a 2. And so I'll start to call by saying very pleased with the fact in January and February, we started out with a nice improvement after really struggling through the fourth quarter. And struggling through the fourth quarter and the latter 9 months of 2015 is more of a statement of what our customers were enduring as their business weakened, particularly those involved in the oil and gas industry and those involved in export. But when I look at March, we're a little disappointed in the month. The month weakened as we get through it. Easter's part of it, the calendar's part of it, but the month did weaken a little bit, and so it was a soft finish to the quarter.
If I -- there's really no other noise in the numbers because the acquisition we did last fall added about 8/10 of a percent to our number, and FX removed about 8/10. So other than the calendar, wasn't a lot of noise.
Speaking of FX, really talking about our foreign business in general, one of the items that we touched on in the call centered on Canada. Canada has an economy that's very much influenced by commodities, particularly energy commodities, but commodities in general. That business for a lot of distributors had been struggling throughout 2015, ours included. 
In the fourth quarter, our business in Canada grew using local currencies removing the FX impact in local days, our business grew about 4%. I'm pleased to say that business improved in the first quarter and grew about 7%. I think that is probably a good teller of some underlying strength that we're seeing in that business and our execution.
From a P&L perspective, and this is a lot of the comments that I share with our folks internally. Sometimes, you need to take a step back and look at what you've been investing in and what it translated into to help understand the puts and takes of your P&L. 
From 10,000 feet, the best way I can think about P&L is this. We added about $33 million in additional revenue from the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. As you see in our published statements, and you saw this in our fourth quarter and you saw it, quite frankly, throughout 2015, with the growth drivers we have in place, particularly the large account emphasis within our growth drivers, the larger our customer gets, typically, the lower the gross margin because in many cases, you're supplying a concentrated offering into a business. It's a more competitive landscape because it's more efficient landscape to operate. And so our gross margin in that business typically lower, but again it's more efficient, so our operating expenses are lower as well. So as we've seen great success in that business, we've seen some trade-off in gross margin.
Also as we went through 2015, our fastener business was particularly hit by the slowdown in the economy, and so we had some product mix as well as customer mix impacts to our margin.
And with the weaker environment, a very competitive landscape, so we did lose gross margin on a year-over-year basis. Our gross margin was largely in line with fourth quarter, and that $33 million in additional revenue translated into about $7 million of additional gross profit because of the contraction in gross margin.
We talked a lot in 2014 -- latter part of '14 and 2015 about adding people to our store base network. As we got later into the year, we also talked about slowing down the growth, and we've continued that discussion of slowing down the growth of people. We think we're to a point where our stores are well staffed, and now we need the business to catch up and quite frankly, get ahead of our headcount growth a bit. But in the last 12 months, we've added about $5 million -- excuse me, we've added about $12 million in additional payroll expense because of all the people we've added. Because a lot high percentage of our compensation is incentive-based, if I look at incentive compensation at the district, regional, national, local level as well as profit-sharing tech contributions, those are down on a year-over-year basis. And so about $7 million of the $12 million was funded by our collective group of employees, and our payroll expenses are up about $5 million in total against $7 million of additional gross profit.
We also been heavily investing in vending, heavily investing in Onsite, heavily investing in growth drivers, and our operating expenses outside of payroll are up about [ph] $5 million. So total expenses are up about $10 million year-over-year, and our earnings down about $3 million. We took on some debt in the last year, 1.5 years to fund the buyback of stock options -- excuse me, stock. So our interest expense is up about $1 million. So our earnings are down just under $4 million a year ago. 
When I look at the investments we've made in people and the investments we made in growth drivers to our business, I believe they're great investments for our  business, short term and long term. However, we don't have the gross profit dollars in the short term to pay for it, and that's why we're holding tight on headcount as we go into the year and also while you'll notice that we softened a bit our store opening expectations for the year.
Then the last year, we cited a range of 60 to 75. We pulled that down to a range of 40 to 60, while still a meaningful number of stores we opened. We really felt given the top -- all the growth drivers we had in place, it was a wise decision to slow that down a little bit. 
Last November, we had an Investor Day. In that Investor Day, we really talked about 4 primary things. They centered on vending -- our industrial vending deployment, talked about Onsite, where we set up a store inside the 4 walls of our customer; we talked about e-commerce, investments we're making to make it easier for our customers interact with us; and we talked about what we call CSP 2016. And that was expanding the merchandising that we have locally in our store to improve our ability to fulfill on a same-day basis, to improve the spectrum of customers we would appeal to, to improve -- frankly to improve our business. When I look at our progress on those, I'm extremely pleased with what we've done not only in the fourth quarter, but what we've done in the first quarter. 
From a vending perspective, we really talked about the team we were adding. So we added about 230 people to drive the optimization of our vending, to drive the signing of our vending and to drive the efficiency of vending. 
When I look at where we are at the end of March, about 60% of our machines have now been optimized. When we talk about it last November at the Investor Day, we were at about 11. So we've made great progress on that, and really what it translates into is a better utilization of our vending platform within our customer business, but also a better value proposition for our customer, because we know part as it goes through a vending machine lowers the consumption, lowers the waste and lowers the expense for our customer. And we think that's a winning combination in our business.
About 80% of our store locations use the vending tab, and what that is and we talked about this in our Investor Day. That is a better integration of the vending within our own point-of-sale platform. It helps our store personnel be more efficient with replenishments, it helps streamline the supply chain and we've made great progress on that, and that's going to serve as well as we go into 2016 and beyond.
As important to those 2 pieces, our pace of signings improved. In the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2015, we signed roughly 4,000 vending devices. In the first quarter, that number improved. We signed about 4,700. So I think we're off to a great start, and that's an important growth driver to our business.
In the case of Onsite, last year, we signed about 82 Onsites. Our historical run rate or pace of annual signing was about 9. So we took a big leap forward in 2015. In fall of '15, at our Investor Day, we talked about a lofty goal. We said our goal is 200 signings of Onsites in 2016. In the first quarter, we signed 48. Frankly, that's the number that was better than I was expecting. I was very hopeful coming into the year, we have a number that would start with the 4 because I knew that was a big step-up from the run rate we had in the latter half of 2015. Our team came through and worked with our customers and signed additional 48. Those will turn on as we go through the year, but I'm very optimistic about our Onsite program as we go through the balance of the year.
E-commerce, as I mentioned, is more about the ease of customer ability to interact with us. There'll be more updates on that in future meetings. That's more of -- when I think of late '16, '17, '18 type of item.
And then finally CSP 2016, we made a hard push late in the year. We've continued that hard push. We currently have just under 1,000 locations converted to the CSP '16 format. And I believe when we get to the end of the second quarter, that number will be closer to a 1,700 or 1,800 number that are substantially converted, which position us well not only for the efficiency of our business, but our ability to appeal to a broader reach of customers and fulfill their needs as we go into the summer.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Sheryl to talk a little bit more in detail about the quarter."

I'm going to provide an update on our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015. The operating cash flow is slightly lower in the first quart",378,"Good morning. I'm going to provide an update on our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015. The operating cash flow is slightly lower in the first quarter of 2016 due to our current initiative to add additional products into our store inventory under our CSP '16 format.
The Q1 operating cash flow is also benefited by minimal tax payments occurring in the first quarter. That will reverse itself in the second, third and fourth quarter of the year.
Our operational working capital year-over-year inventory growth was approximately $97 million. The main drivers of the increase in the inventory were driven by the CSP '16 initiatives, which was approximately 35% of the increase. International inventory growth and the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. contributed approximately another 25% of the increase, and then the last main driver was the Onsite and large customer impacts, which were approximately an increase of 10%. 
We also disclosed in our earnings release that we had previously indicated our net capital expenditures would be approximately $128 million in 2016. We now believe given the new vending locker lease agreement and the strong start to vending signings in the first quarter that we will have total net capital expenditures of approximately $197 million to $200 million in 2016.
We do plan to fund this increase as well as some of our previously planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of a proposed private placement of debt. 
During the first quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share for a total of approximately $59 million. And during the last 7 quarters, we have purchased 8.7 million shares of our stock or approximately $396 million worth of stock, which represents about 3.3% of our outstanding shares from the start of this time frame.
As Dan mentioned earlier, last night, we announced a dividend of $0.30 per share. This will be our second quarter dividend for the year. So we have strong cash flow, and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.
And with that, I will open it up to questions from the group."

The districts that did not are growing low single digit. We really look at the Onsite business as being -- when we go on an Onsite, what Chris had talked about last fall in our Investor Day was we really believe that when we exit a 12-month period after rolling out the Onsites, and we have Onsites that turned on throughout the year. That's when the numbers start getting a little muddy, but we really believe based on our data that we when exit the 12-month period, we'll add close to 80,000 to 120,000 of additional monthly revenue on a per Onsite basis."

It was in a declining mode when we were -- as we were going through the fourth quarter, quite frankly, declining mode throughout 2015. We really saw the stabilization start to occur in the February, March time frame from the standpoint what was going on with gross margin. So I really believe when I look out to the balance of the year, 50% is probably a better target. When I look out long term, it's really going to be a function more of how successful we are with the Onsite program because that will materially change longer term our customer mix. But it's a very attractive ability to grow the business long term and the operating leverage long term."

The -- when I think of vending, you're dead on with your comment or your question and comment about vending is really about our nonfastener business.

The -- when I think of vending, you're dead on with your comment or your question and comment about vending is really about our nonfastener business. Vending really isn't used for dispensing of fasteners. Now there are some extensions of vending that over time how our bin stocks or things like that will include -- will incorporate essentially some of the vending-type technology for replenishment cycle, but vending is about nonfasteners. And so we've done a great job deploying vending to our existing customers over the last 5 years, and the fastener piece is about their economic activity and our ability to take market share. And I think the story when I look at the fastener piece is about the economic activity. The nonfastener piece is about the activity and our ability to grow and deploy vending. So we can have a customer whose business in the fastener -- in the fastener piece is down because we have a great market penetration already, and their business is just off. But we can grow the nonfastener piece because of vending because we're deploying a better supply chain to our customer. Because when I think about our deal with our customer and what our customer truly needs, put yourself in the shoes of the purchasing manager, the plant manager. They live in a world where there's constant demands on them for improvement. They're working with fewer resources every day. So what they need from their supplier isn't just great fulfillment. I think that's the starting point. They need a better supply chain partner. And In the case of vending, in the case of bin stock, in the case of our Onsite model, we're a better supply chain partner.

But when I think of what are some of the positives, in the fourth quarter, that was probably as oblique appeared as you could see and I was not hesitant to share my thoughts on it during the fourth quarter. But our fasteners, as an example, were down about 6% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, they are down around 2%. Our nonfasteners were struggling in the fourth quarter, and I don't have the exact stat in front of me -- I'm sorry, but if they improved to mid-single digits -- upper single digits, in the first quarter. And so we saw, generally speaking, an improvement in our business, and that's, I think what we're really talking about. I think what we see is the business in January, February, and I can't quite say that for March, but January, February felt more like where we were in October. And I think if I look at the last 5 or 6 months, I really think the outliers was the extreme weakness we saw in November, December. And I think that was a function of companies just shutting down around the holidays more extensively than normal. March -- only April and May will start to answer for us what really happened in March."

One, our growth is primarily coming from large account, and that deepened as we went through the year.

One, our growth is primarily coming from large account, and that deepened as we went through the year. The -- it's primarily coming from -- if I think of our sales number and the weakness, when you -- we've done a nice job signing new customers, both Onsites and traditional and national account customers that aren't Onsite. When you're doing a nice job picking market share, you're turning on a lot of new business. And that lot of times you're turning on a lot of new business, you do get some short-term mix issues going on in that you -- a new large customer isn't at average margins for that group on day 1. Because it takes your time 6, 9 and 12 months to work through some of the hiccups in the system of finding the best source of supply, finding the best part match for this item when you're turning on new business. And typically, you have your existing business that is supporting that because that existing business, you've done a better job of improving your supply chain already. If you think of what's really hurting us right now is from a revenue and revenue growth perspective, we're doing a wonderful job signing new national accounts. We're doing a wonderful job signing Onsites. We're doing a wonderful job signing vending and growing those pieces of business. So we're taking market share at a very good clip. What's causing us to struggle is our existing book of business. Our existing customers are struggling in a weak environment, and so the more mature component of our business is going backwards. And that more mature piece has -- because if I had a customer -- excuse me, for 2 or 3 years, I've already in many cases established a lot of the best parts, a lot of the best source of supply to serve that customer's needs. And that's in my mix, and that mix is weakened right now. So that's a piece of it. The other piece of it is on an execution standpoint, we slipped a little bit as we went through 2015. We slipped a little bit on the freight, how good we are on our freight expense versus our freight that we charge to customer. Part of that, I think, it became more difficult for our stores to operate effectively given that fuel prices were lower. Fuel prices is an important part of our distribution cost, but it's not the only component. But it might make it harder for you to charge freight on this item or that. And the fact that it's a weak environment, it's a competitive marketplace. I feel we're at that point where our gross margins are stable from a sequential standpoint, but that still has been a painful process on a year-over-year basis. There's no question about that."

270747,329152839,958315,"Fastenal Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2016",2016-04-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining in on the First Quarter 2016 Fastenal Company Earnings Call. Press release went out first thing this morning. Hopefully, you all saw as well, we put out a press release yesterday even",2035,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining in on the First Quarter 2016 Fastenal Company Earnings Call. Press release went out first thing this morning. Hopefully, you all saw as well, we put out a press release yesterday evening announcing our dividend -- our second quarter dividend. 
In the quarter, we grew our sales about 3.5%. We had the benefit of additional business day during the quarter. So on a daily basis, we grew about 2%. Our earnings per share grew just over 2%, primarily driven by the fact that we had bought a considerable amount of our stock in the last 15 months because our actual earnings were down slightly from a year ago.
A bit of a noisy quarter in that the calendar had some stuff going on. We -- the daily number, which is what we typically report, can be influenced positively or negatively by the change from year-over-year and the number of business days in a calendar month. So in January, it was a 20-day month versus 21. February, we had an additional day, so it was a 21 versus a 20. And in March, we had an additional day, so it was a 23 versus a 22. And March also had Easter, which had been in April in each of the last 2 years.
I throw these into the equation because they can influence the number. So if you look at our numbers as reported in January, we grew at 3.3 daily average, February grew at 2.6. In March, we dropped to 0.0, so we basically had no growth in the final month of the quarter.
If I factor in the change in days, I think of the month as being January, we grew between 2.5 and 3. February, we probably grew closer to 3. In March, we probably grew just under 1. If I add Easter into the equation, that March number probably is closer to a 2. And so I'll start to call by saying very pleased with the fact in January and February, we started out with a nice improvement after really struggling through the fourth quarter. And struggling through the fourth quarter and the latter 9 months of 2015 is more of a statement of what our customers were enduring as their business weakened, particularly those involved in the oil and gas industry and those involved in export. But when I look at March, we're a little disappointed in the month. The month weakened as we got through it. Easter's part of it, the calendar's part of it, but the month did weaken a little bit, and so it was a soft finish to the quarter.
If I -- there's really no other noise in the numbers because the acquisition we did last fall added about 8/10 of a percent to our number, and FX removed about 8/10. So other than the calendar, wasn't a lot of noise.
Speaking of FX, really talking about our foreign business in general, one of the items that we touched on in the call centered on Canada. Canada has an economy that's very much influenced by commodities, particularly energy commodities, but commodities in general. That business for a lot of distributors had been struggling throughout 2015, ours included. 
In the fourth quarter, our business in Canada grew using local currencies, so removing the FX impact, and local days, our business grew about 4%. I'm pleased to say that business improved in the first quarter and grew about 7%. I think that is probably a good teller of some underlying strength that we're seeing in that business and our execution.
From a P&L perspective -- and this is a lot of the comments that I've shared with our folks entirely. Sometimes you need to take a step back and look at what you've been investing in and what it's translated into to help understand the puts and takes of your P&L. 
From 10,000 feet, the best way I can think about the P&L is this. We added about $33 million in additional revenue from the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. As you see in our published statements, and you saw this in our fourth quarter and you saw it, quite frankly, throughout 2015 with the growth drivers we have in place, particularly the large account emphasis within our growth drivers. The larger our customer gets, typically the lower the gross margin because in many cases, you're supplying a concentrated offering into a business. It's a more competitive landscape because it's a more efficient landscape to operate. And so our gross margin in that business is typically lower, but again it's more efficient, so our operating expenses are lower as well. So as we've seen great success in that business, we've seen some trade-off in gross margin.
Also as we went through 2015, our fastener business was particularly hit by the slowdown in the economy, and so we had some product mix as well as customer mix impacts to our margin.
And with the weaker environment, a very competitive landscape, so we did lose gross margin on a year-over-year basis. Our gross margin was largely in line with fourth quarter, and that $33 million in additional revenue translated into about $7 million of additional gross profit because of the contraction in gross margin.
We talked a lot in 2014 -- latter part of '14 and 2015 about adding people to our store base network. As we got later into the year, we also talked about slowing down the growth, and we've continued that discussion of slowing down the growth of people. We think we're to a point where our stores are well staffed, and now we need the business to catch up and quite frankly, get ahead of our headcount growth a bit. But in the last 12 months, we've added about $5 million -- excuse me, we've added about $12 million in additional payroll expense because of all the people we've added. Because a lot -- high percentage of our compensation is incentive-based, if I look at incentive compensation at the district, regional, national, local level as well as profit-sharing tech contributions, those are down on a year-over-year basis. And so about $7 million of the $12 million was funded by our collective group of employees, and our payroll expenses are up about $5 million in total against $7 million of additional gross profit.
We also have been heavily investing in vending, heavily investing in Onsite, heavily investing in growth drivers, and our operating expenses outside of payroll are up about $5 million. So total expenses are up about $10 million year-over-year, and our earnings down about $3 million. We took on some debt in the last year, 1.5 years to fund the buyback of stock options -- excuse me, stock. So our interest expense is up about $1 million. So our earnings are down just under $4 million a year ago. 
When I look at the investments we've made in people and the investments we made in growth drivers to our business, I believe they're great investments for our  business, short term and long term. However, we don't have the gross profit dollars in the short term to pay for it, and that's why we're holding tight on headcount as we go into the year and also while you'll notice that we softened a bit our store opening expectations for the year.
Then the last year, we cited a range of 60 to 75. We pulled that down to a range of 40 to 60, while still a meaningful number of stores were opened. We really felt given the top -- all the growth drivers we had in place, it was a wise decision to slow that down a little bit. 
Last November, we had an Investor Day. In that Investor Day, we really talked about 4 primary things. They centered on vending -- our industrial vending deployment, talked about Onsite, where we set up a store inside the 4 walls of our customer; we talked about e-commerce, investments we're making to make it easier for our customers to interact with us; and we talked about what we call CSP 2016. And that was expanding the merchandising that we have locally in our store to improve our ability to fulfill on a same-day basis, to improve the spectrum of customers we would appeal to, to improve -- frankly to improve our business. When I look at our progress on those, I'm extremely pleased with what we've done not only in the fourth quarter, but what we've done in the first quarter. 
From a vending perspective, we really talked about the team we were adding. So we added about 230 people to drive the optimization of our vending, to drive the signing of our vending and to drive the efficiency of vending. 
When I look at where we are at the end of March, about 60% of our machines have now been optimized. When we talk about it last November at the Investor Day, we were at about 11. So we've made great progress on that, and really what it translates into is a better utilization of our vending platform within our customer business, but also a better value proposition for our customer, because we know product that goes through a vending machine lowers the consumption, lowers the waste and lowers the expense for our customer. And we think that's a winning combination in our business.
About 80% of our store locations use the vending tab, and what that is and we talked about this on our Investor Day. That is a better integration of the vending within our own point-of-sale platform. It helps our store personnel be more efficient with the replenishment, it helps streamline the supply chain and we've made great progress on that, and that's going to serve as well as we go into 2016 and beyond.
As important to those 2 pieces, our pace of signings improved. In the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2015, we signed roughly 4,000 vending devices. In the first quarter, that number improved. We signed about 4,700. So I think we're off to a great start, and that's an important growth driver to our business.
In the case of Onsite, last year, we signed about 82 Onsites. Our historical run rate or pace of annual signing was about 9. So we took a big leap forward in 2015. In fall of '15, at our Investor Day, we talked about a lofty goal. We said our goal is 200 signings of Onsites in 2016. In the first quarter, we signed 48. Frankly, that's the number that was better than I was expecting. I was very hopeful coming into the year, we have a number that would start with a 4 because I knew that was a big step-up from the run rate we had in the latter half of 2015. Our team came through and worked with our customers and signed additional 48. Those will turn on as we go through the year, but I'm very optimistic about our Onsite program as we go through the balance of the year.
E-commerce, as I mentioned, is more about the ease of our customer ability to interact with us. There'll be more updates on that in future meetings. That's more of a -- when I think of a late '16, '17, '18 type of item.
And then finally CSP 2016, we made a hard push late in the year. We've continued that hard push. We currently have just under 1,000 locations converted to the CSP 16 format. And I believe when we get to the end of the second quarter, that number will be closer to a 1,700 or 1,800 number that are substantially converted, which position us well not only for the efficiency of our business, but our ability to appeal to a broader range of customers and fulfill their needs as we go into the summer.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Sheryl to talk a little bit more in detail about the quarter."

I'm going to provide an update on our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015. The operating cash flow is slightly lower in the first quart",378,"Good morning. I'm going to provide an update on our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015. The operating cash flow is slightly lower in the first quarter of 2016 due to our current initiative to add additional products into our store inventory under our CSP 16 format.
The Q1 operating cash flow is also benefited by minimal tax payments occurring in the first quarter. That will reverse itself in the second, third and fourth quarter of the year.
Our operational working capital year-over-year inventory growth was approximately $97 million. The main drivers of the increase in the inventory were driven by the CSP 16 initiatives, which was approximately 35% of the increase. International inventory growth and the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. contributed approximately another 25% of the increase, and then the last main driver was the Onsite and large customer impacts, which were approximately an increase of 10%. 
We also disclosed in our earnings release that we had previously indicated our net capital expenditures would be approximately $128 million in 2016. We now believe given the new vending locker lease agreement and the strong start to vending signings in the first quarter that we will have total net capital expenditures of approximately $197 million to $200 million in 2016.
We do plan to fund this increase as well as some of our previously planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of a proposed private placement of debt. 
During the first quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share for a total of approximately $59 million. And during the last 7 quarters, we have purchased 8.7 million shares of our stock or approximately $396 million worth of stock, which represents about 3.3% of our outstanding shares from the start of this time frame.
As Dan mentioned earlier, last night we announced a dividend of $0.30 per share. This will be our second quarter dividend for the year. So we have strong cash flow, and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.
And with that, I will open it up to questions from the group."

The districts that did not are growing low single digit. We really look at the Onsite business as being -- when we go on an Onsite, what Chris had talked about last fall in our Investor Day was we really believe that when we exit a 12-month period after rolling out the Onsites, and we have Onsites that turned on throughout the year. So that's when the numbers start getting a little muddy, but we really believe based on our data that we when exit the 12-month period, we'll add close to 80,000 to 120,000 of additional monthly revenue on a per Onsite basis."

We really saw the stabilization start to occur in the February, March time frame from the standpoint of what was going on with gross margin. So I really believe when I look out to the balance of the year, 50% is probably a better target. When I look out long term, it's really going to be a function more of how successful we are with the Onsite program because that will materially change longer term our customer mix. But it's very attractive an ability to grow the business long term and the operating leverage long term."

The -- when I think of vending, you're dead on with your comment or your question and comment about vending is really about our nonfastener business. Vending really isn't used for dispensing of fasteners. Now there are some extensions of vending that over time are how our bin stocks worth and things like that, will include -- will incorporate essentially some of the vending-type technology for replenishment cycle, but vending is about nonfasteners. And so we've done a great job deploying vending to our existing customers over the last 5 years, and the fastener piece is about their economic activity and our ability to take market share. And I think the story when I look at the fastener piece is about the economic activity. The nonfastener piece is about the activity and our ability to grow and deploy vending. So we can have a customer whose business in the fastener -- in the fastener piece is down because we have a great market penetration already, and their business is just off. But we can grow the nonfastener piece because of vending because we're deploying a better supply chain to our customer. Because when I think about our deal with our customer and what our customer truly needs, put yourself in the shoes of the purchasing manager, the plant manager. They live in a world where there's constant demands on them for improvement. They're working with fewer resources every day. So what they need from their supplier isn't just great fulfillment. I think that's the starting point. They need a better supply chain partner. And In the case of vending, in the case of bin stock, in the case of our Onsite model, we're a better supply chain partner. And we highlight this point because it demonstrates that even in a weak economy, we can grow our business, because we're a better supply chain partner for our customer."

But other than that, I don't really see us pulling back on the initiatives that we'll have in place. As we talked about in 2015, a lot of the big, big initiatives we had from a CapEx standpoint are in our rear-view mirror. I'm talking about automation of our distribution centers, and the initial build of growing a vending -- of creating and growing a vending business. So I don't see a lot of other pullback, but Sheryl, you can touch on exact numbers."

But when I think of what are some of the positives, in the fourth quarter, that was probably as bleak a period as you could see and I was not hesitant to share my thoughts on it during the fourth quarter. But our fasteners, as an example, were down about 6% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, they're down around 2%. Our nonfasteners were struggling in the fourth quarter, and I don't have the exact stat in front of me, I'm sorry, but they improved to mid-single digits -- upper single digits, in the first quarter. And so we saw, generally speaking, an improvement in our business, and that's, I think, what we're really talking about. I think what we see is the business in January, February, and I can't quite say that for March, but in January, February, felt more like where we were in October. And I think if I look at the last 5 or 6 months, I really think the outliers was the extreme weakness we saw in November and December. And I think that was a function of companies just shutting down around the holidays more extensively than normal. March -- only April and May will start to answer for us what really happened in March."

One, our growth is primarily coming from large account, and that deepened as we went through the year. The -- it's primarily coming from -- if I think of our sales number and the weakness, when you -- we've done a nice job",484,"Yes. There's a number of things. One, our growth is primarily coming from large account, and that deepened as we went through the year. The -- it's primarily coming from -- if I think of our sales number and the weakness, when you -- we've done a nice job signing new customers, both Onsites and traditional and national account customers that aren't Onsite. When you're doing a nice job taking market share, you're turning on a lot of new business. And that lot of times you're turning on a lot of new business, you do get some short-term mix issues going on in that you -- a new large customer isn't at average margins for that group on day 1. Because it takes you time 6, 9 and 12 months to work through some of the hiccups in the system of finding the best source of supply, finding the best part match for this item when you're turning on new business. And typically, you have your existing business that is supporting that because that existing business, you've done a better job of improving your supply chain already. If you think of what's really hurting us right now is from a revenue and revenue growth perspective, we're doing a wonderful job signing new national accounts. We're doing a wonderful job signing Onsites. We're doing a wonderful job signing vending and growing those pieces of business. So we're taking market share at a very good clip. What's causing us to struggle is our existing book of business. Our existing customers are struggling in a weak environment, and so the more mature component of our business is going backwards. And that more mature piece has -- because if I had had a customer -- excuse me, for 2 or 3 years, I've already in many cases established a lot of the best parts, a lot of the best source of supply to serve that customer's needs. And that's in my mix, and that mix is weakened right now. So that's a piece of it. The other piece of it is on an execution standpoint, we slipped a little bit as we went through 2015. We slipped a little bit on the freight, how good we are on our freight expense versus our freight that we charge to customer. Part of that, I think, it became more difficult for our stores to operate as effectively given that fuel prices were lower. Fuel prices is an important part of our distribution cost, but it's not the only component. But it might make it harder for you to charge freight on this item or that. And the fact that it's a weak environment, it's a competitive marketplace. I feel we're at a point where our gross margins are stable from a sequential standpoint, but that still has been a painful process on a year-over-year basis. There's no question about that."

I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January. Unofficially stepped into the role last Octobe",2607,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our earnings call for the second quarter of 2016. I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January. Unofficially stepped into the role last October. I'm a firm believer and I have some CEOs that came before me at Fastenal that did an excellent job of doing 2 things: providing vision to the -- to our shareholders and to the employees of Fastenal; and providing perspective periodically on what we are building for course correction as we go through a period of time.
In the case of vision, I'd like to believe the vision that we laid out last November in our Investor Day and the vision that we believe, I believe is the correct one for Fastenal, is being presented in a meaningful fashion. I think we're seeing traction on that.
From the vantage point of the second perspective, perspective is looking at the business in my mind as you go through the quarter. Again, pointing things out. As you look through the quarter, you look through the year. We go through the month, pointing things out and seeing a cause and effect from a standpoint of a reaction and improvement on certain things. Are uncertain things that aren't moving fast enough.
In that regard, I would have to say I let the Fastenal organization and our shareholders down in the second quarter. There are also some missteps we made, but let's get to the vision first. We talked last November about the vision of Fastenal. And one thing that I think is critical to our success as we go forth in this year and into the years to follow in this momentum we're building as an organization, one of the hallmarks of the organization that I've known for well just over 20 years in June, I hit 20 years with Fastenal, a milestone I'm particularly proud of, is the fact that we are an organization that builds momentum, whether that momentum is coming from the opening of stores, the adding of people, the signing of and installing of vending machines, we are an organization that creates momentum for ourselves. And that allows us to separate in the marketplace our ability to grow long term. Our in the large market, we have a large opportunity and it's upon us to build the momentum to go out and take that opportunity.
We didn't have great momentum coming into the year and you see that shining through in some of our numbers this quarter, and I'll get into a few more specifics in a second. But on the building off momentum front, in the first 6 months of this year, we signed 92 Onsites, 48 in the first quarter, 44 in the second quarter. Our stated goal is to sign 200 for the year. 
Personally, I want to have no quarter that doesn't start with at least a 4. And it will be great have a quarter or 2 that starts with a 5. So far, I believe in the first 2 quarters of the year, we've made a tremendous transition in our ability to sign Onsites. 
And Onsite, for those of you who are not familiar with it, is about setting up a store inside the ability and having an even more intimate relationship than we've had in the past. We have currently 333, I believe that's the number Onsites that are operating. Of the 92, we've turned on, I believe, close to 50 Onsites but we're making very good progress on changing the organization to build -- start building that momentum that we'll need as we into '17, '18 and beyond. 
In regards to vending, in the first 2 quarters of this year, we signed 9,516 devices. And we signed more in the second quarter than the first quarter. Earlier in the year, we added 200 -- roughly 230 people into our business to support vending and to drive our signing with vendings. And I'll touch on a few stats in a second of why that's important. But I'm proud to say that we're gaining some momentum there. 
Part of the process with this new group of people was to go out and optimize our existing devices. In many cases, that optimization involved adding products into the machines to improve the throughput of the machine. In some cases, it was changing the configuration of the machines to improve the efficiency of replenishing the machine. And so in optimization isn't all revenue-based. It might be a service-based aspect, but we've optimized approximately 75% of our machines in the first 6 month of the year. That's the good news.
The second set of good news that we continue to see good statistics out of the group of stores. The bad news is that it also required the removal of a certain number of machines. We removed 7,200 machines in the first 6 months of this year as we went through our optimization process. Many of those machines are great decisions that -- that we've removed, are great decisions because we went from 10 machines to 9. We went from 4 machines to 3 because we really rationalized the equipment we needed to support that customer. And that's a great decision because it allows us to get a better return on that deployed. 
Unfortunately, some of the machines we removed were examples where we have a machine in an environment where either the business had changed or the business never truly justified a vending machine and we went from 1 to 0 or 2 to 0. But I believe we have a much better business, vending business today than we had 6 months ago and we continue to see great traction in our signings. And everyday, we're doing a better job vending those signings than we did the day before. We're becoming a much better vending company. 
If I look at the second quarter, we grew our business just under 2%. Our vending customers grew just under 3%. Those customers, like many of our customers especially in particular industries heavily hit by either weaker energy prices or weaker activity in the industrial marketplace. Our fastener business with vending customers was down 5% in the second quarter. So that group of customers that grew 3%, their fastener business with us was down 5%. I think that's an indicator of what's going on in their economic circumstance.
The non-fastener business for that same group of customers grew about 6%. And if I take it one step further, the dollars going through the vending machine grew about 11%. So what we're seeing is a group of customers, about 45% of our revenue is with customers that have vending. Our revenue with that group of customers is growing at about twice the rate of our overall business as a company. That group of customers is as hurt by the economy as any other group, and you're seeing that shine through in the fastener business. And yet, our non-fastener business continues to grow very well and our business for the vending machine is growing double-digit. 
We believe vending is an example of engagement in our customer, just like Onsite is an example of engagement with our customer. We believe we're building momentum that will serve us well in the years to follow.
The third piece of momentum I believe we're building is our CSP 16. I believe we're at about 1,900 stores converted. Our CSP 16 is largely in place with the revenue drivers of our business. And what I mean by that is there's some stores that have yet to convert. They might be smaller stores or stores that are in the process of moving. But they are -- but our revenue base is largely complete as it relates to CSP 16. And that positions us to be a better same-day supplier to our customers, be a more efficient supplier to our customers and broaden our appeal on the range of customers that can buy from us. And I believe that will serve us well in the months and years to follow.
Finally, we are very good momentum on our national account signings. We highlighted that in the points raised. I believe it was on the second page of the press release. That's being helped by Onsite signings. Onsite signings are being helped by that. They serve each other well because 75% of our Onsites are with national account customers. That's the vision and I believe the momentum we're building as we go through 2016.
Now the perspective part and the part where -- as I mentioned earlier, I think frankly, I could've done better from the standpoint of providing perspective to the team at Fastenal. Our top 10 customers in the first quarter, and our top 10 customers represent 8% to 10% of revenue in the month to quarter you're looking at. That group was growing at about 14% in the first quarter, largely buoyed by a few customers that were new to that group. 
The key to that group every year is what is the new blood you're bringing into it? And what are you doing with your existing group of customers that were there in the past? And at the district level, we refer to that as our top 25. In the regional level, we refer to that as our top 300 customers. It's really what's happening with your big customers and what new customers are you bringing into that group. 
The growth for that group, which was double-digit in the first quarter and was double-digit in April, went to 0 in the month of May and went to negative 6% in the month of June. So in the second quarter, that group of customers grew at about 8%. 
If I look at the top 100 customers in our business, and again, they represent about 25% of our revenue, the top 10 I just talked about will be a subset. In the first quarter, that group of customers grew about 4.5%. In the month of April, that group of customers grew 6.5%. In the month of May, that group of customers contracted about 2%. In the month of June, that group of customers contracted about 2.5%. For the quarter, that group of customers, which grew almost 5%, 4.5% in first quarter, grew 0.7% in the second quarter.
When I look at that group of customers, I see that sudden falloff as an example, not of the momentum we're building but of slowdowns with momentum we've built in the past, with customers we've added in the past where we have a large market presence and that business fell off later in the quarter. The perspective part that we failed on is we didn't react fast enough locally and company-wide to that falling revenue in the month of May and June.
As it relates to gross margin, you'll notice a couple things omitted from our press release this quarter. One is a stated range and that stated range was not removed because I felt it was accurate, it was removed because it was becoming too much noise to our conversation. I believe you own Fastenal because Fastenal is an organization that builds momentum and carries that momentum forward. And it's good enough at executing the business that we're able to capture that momentum in very attractive profit growth over time and very attractive returns.
Therefore, our focus internally is 90% on building the momentum. But in the case of gross margin, our gross margin dropped about 30 basis points during the quarter from the first quarter. About 25 basis points of that drop remain -- was tied to some of the activities around a very rapid CSP 16 rollout, and really more than that, a number of efficiencies we introduced into our store network. Inventory by location -- they come under a bunch of names. 
What we're introducing and we want to do it very rapidly, maybe a little bit too rapidly, but we want to do it very rapidly to move forward. During that process, there were some components of our inventory we decided to sell off at a lower price. There were some components of our inventory that we decided to remove from our business. There's about 10 basis points of that drop that I believe are behind us. There's about 15 to 20 basis points of that drop that I believe will remain for several quarters. 
I was willing to move quickly on that as we entered the second quarter as I held there were no other things we were doing that we could fund that, if you will, by other gross profit initiatives. Those didn't materialize, unfortunately, and the gross margin that you see as a result. 
And related to operating expenses, there's really probably 2 things that are noteworthy in our operating expenses. And Sheryl's going to touch on those in more depth in these and a few more. But the 2 things that jumped out for me. Our fuel costs were up about $2.5 million from Q1 to Q2, but that's a fact of the price of gasoline at the pump and diesel fuel at the pump. Where we didn't execute real well is we didn't react quickly to adjusting some of our store routes or local routes, but more importantly, we didn't react very quickly our propensity to charge freight, and therefore, we largely bore that expense without sharing that expense.
The second one, and this is a mechanical thing and it's something that I talked about with many of you over the last year on earnings calls. And that is historically, we have a very good flex in our operating expenses as it relates to incentive comp. And what it means in the short term for our ability to absorb some worsening environments and a little bit of the incremental margin we give back in strong periods. 
And that is as we had gone through 2015, our incentive comp was compressing dramatically. And if you take a look for a proxy, you can see that from the standpoint of the impact on the executive compensation. But it contracted dramatically. And so the district and regional and store leadership component of that is at a compressed level, and so the ability to flex there is limited in the current environment. You saw that shine through, unfortunately, in the current quarter.
Finally, 2 things I'll touch on and they really raised momentum [indiscernible] I was discussing earlier and that is and we highlighted it, we installed during the quarter approximately 3,000 locker leased devices under our locker lease program that we initiated earlier in the year with Wal-Mart. The total rollout of that will be approximately 15,000 devices, and we'll roll out as we go through the balance of this year and I believe a little bit into early next year. We think it's an excellent program for us long term and we entered into it. 
The second one is at our Investor Day last year, we unveiled our outdoor locker. As of today, we have approximately 30 outdoor store lockers in place. We expect to have about 50 by September. And while it's not very meaningful from a revenue perspective and it won't be very meaningful from a revenue perspective when I look at '16 or '17, it's a step we're taking and one more means to be a much better supplier to our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Sheryl."
270747,369244603,1005904,"Fastenal Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 12, 2016",2016-07-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to",709,"I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to a store or some other type of selling location. 
During the first half of 2016, our payroll-related expenses increased due to the addition of personnel related to the acquisition of Fasteners Inc., which occurred in November of 2015 and the addition of vending specialists, information technology development resources and distribution personnel. And we also experienced an increase in our health care costs. 
These increases were partially offset by contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit sharing contribution, primarily due to lower sales growth and due to lower operating income, both on a dollar basis and a relative basis. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Regarding occupancy expenses, the increase in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 was driven by an increase in industrial vending equipment and also an increase in investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years, primarily related to automated -- automation. The largest impact related to the industrial vending equipment. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Selling, transportation costs including in operating and administrative expenses increased in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015. This was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and the timing of leased vehicle sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
During the second quarter of 2016, we did not repurchase any stock. However, in the first quarter of 2016, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share. We spent approximately $396 million buying back stock since June 30, 2014, and repurchased approximately 3.3% of our shares outstanding from the start of this time frame.
Regarding that capital expenditures. In the first half of 2016, our net capital expenditures expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were $86 million or 33.3% of net earnings. We expect our net capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million in 2016. And we plan to fund a portion of our planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of a private placement of debt. We expect to close on this funding in late July 2016.
Regarding operational working capital. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory grew by $108 million, and this growth was driven by the following factors: CSP 16 was approximately 50% of the increase; our international inventory growth was approximately 9% of the increase; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. related to 8% of the increase; Onsite and large customer impacts were approximately 14% of the increase.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings contracted slightly in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 due to our current initiative to add additional products into a store inventory under our CSP 16 format. This was partially offset by a reduction in net cash used to fund accounts receivable. 
Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments, and this benefit reverses itself in the second, third and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September and December.
Our free cash flow year-to-date for 2016 is 63% of earnings, which compares to year-to-date 2015 at 66% of earnings. Last night, we announced a Q3 dividend of $0.30 per share. As a takeaway, I'd like to share with the group that we have a strong cash flow and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to questions from the group."

So it's a whole bunch of pieces to grow. And I'm not even including in that the impact of international, which is now getting to be a meaningful piece of our business and a piece of our business that grew nicely both from a revenue and a profit perspective in the current quarter. But if I look at it, let's say, over a multi-year period, we can sign 200, 300 Onsites a year. And if they truly turn into $1 million to $1.5 million revenue growers as we move forward, a piece of our business would migrate there, but more importantly, that would provide us, I believe, 5 points of growth, and we're looking at this 3 and 4 and 5 years out right there on top of what vending would do. And part of the vending -- I'm double counting because some of the vending will go to the customer and what our store base could do. I really believe from just doing the math and assuming we can -- we have the horsepower, because I know the markets there, the horsepower to pull it off which I believe we have or can add, that it's a business that over a multi-year perspective good grow in the low double digits. Now we need our store piece to execute well on that environment. We need our vending piece to execute it well in that environment but I believe that's achievable. If I'm wrong on the store piece and how much we can add there, it would translate that from lower double digits to an upper single digit. But I think in either scenario, it's a very attractive and profitable growth."

And when I looked over the past 5 years in periods where you've grown 5% or greater, it's been about 25%. Should we assume that maybe 20% to 25% is a better range, given the importance of Onsite in that growth algorithm?"

In the case of the construction question you raised, the point I was making there is the fact that we saw it particularly weak with energy customers, and I don't know that there is enough -- I don't know if the oil price is such that there should be a rush back to any kind of new construction there, new activity there. I think it's been idle for a period of time. In the case of fasteners, again, that was very much related -- that was amplified by the fact that we had some large customers that were shut down and really hit the radar. And what you really see when that shutdown occurs, it hits the OEM fastener, because they're shutting down their production. They're still doing some maintenance so you might not see it in the non-fastener, but you'll see it in the fastener number."

I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January, unofficially stepped into the role last Octobe",2629,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our earnings call for the second quarter of 2016. I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January, unofficially stepped into the role last October. I'm a firm believer, and I have some CEOs that came before me at Fastenal that did an excellent job of doing 2 things: providing vision to the -- to our shareholders and to the employees of Fastenal and providing perspective periodically on what we are building for course correction as we go through a period of time.
In the case of vision, I'd like to believe the vision that we laid out last November in our Investor Day and the vision that we believe, I believe, is the correct one for Fastenal, is being presented in a meaningful fashion. I think we're seeing traction on that.
From the vantage point of the second item, perspective, perspective is looking at the business in my mind as you go through the quarter. Again, pointing things out. As you look through the quarter, you look through the year, you go through the month, pointing things out and seeing a cause and effect from the standpoint of a reaction and improvement on certain things. Or you accelerate on certain things that aren't moving fast enough.
In that regard, I would have to say I let the Fastenal organization and our shareholders down in the second quarter because there were some missteps we made. But let's look at vision first. We talked last November about the vision of Fastenal. And one thing that I think is critical to our success as we go forth in this year and into the years to follow is the momentum we're building as an organization. One of the hallmarks of the organization that I've known for, well, just over 20 years, in June, I hit 20 years with Fastenal, a milestone I'm particularly proud of, is the fact that we are an organization that builds momentum. Whether that momentum is coming from the opening of stores, the adding of people, the signing of and installing of vending machines, we are an organization that creates momentum for ourselves, and that allows us to separate in the marketplace our ability to grow long term. We operate in a large market. We have a large opportunity, and it's upon us to build the momentum to go out and take that opportunity.
We didn't have great momentum coming into the year, and you see that shining through in some of our numbers this quarter, and I'll get into a few more specifics in a second. But on the building of momentum front, in the first 6 months of this year, we signed 92 Onsites, 48 in the first quarter, 44 in the second quarter. Our stated goal is to sign 200 for the year. 
Personally, I want to have no quarter that doesn't start with at least a 4, and it'd be great to have a quarter or 2 that starts with a 5. So far, I believe in the first 2 quarters of the year, we've made a tremendous transition in our ability to sign Onsites. 
And Onsites, for those of you not familiar with it, is really about us setting up a store inside the customer's facility and having an even more intimate relationship than we've had in the past. We have currently 333, I believe that's the number, Onsites that are operating. Of the 92, we've turned on, I believe, close to 50 Onsites. But we're making very good progress on changing the organization to start building that momentum that we'll need as we go into '17, '18 and beyond. 
In regards to vending, in the first 2 quarters of this year, we signed 9,516 devices, and we signed more in the second quarter than the first quarter. Earlier in the year, we added roughly 230 people into our business to support vending and to drive our signings with vendings. And I'll touch on a few stats in a second of why that's important, but I'm proud to say that we're gaining some momentum there. 
Part of the process with this new group of people was to go out and optimize our existing devices. In many cases, that optimization involved adding products into the machines to improve the throughput of the machines. In some cases, it was changing the configuration of the machines to improve the efficiency of replenishing the machine. And so an optimization isn't all revenue-based. It might be a service-based aspect. But we've optimized approximately 75% of our machines in the first 6 months of the year. That's a good news.
The second set of good news is we continue to see good statistics out of the group of stores. The bad news is it also required the removal of a certain number of machines. We removed 7,200 machines in the first 6 months of this year as we went through our optimization process. Many of those machines are great decisions -- that we removed are great decisions because we went from 10 machines to 9. We went from 4 machines to 3 because we really rationalized the equipment we needed to support that customer, and that's a great decision because it allows us to get a better return on that asset that's deployed. 
Unfortunately, some of the machines we removed were examples where we had a machine in an environment where either the business had changed or the business never truly justified a vending machine, and we went from 1 to 0 or 2 to 0. But I believe we have a much better business -- vending business today than we had 6 months ago, and we continue to see great traction in our signings. And every day, we're doing a better job vetting new signings than we did the day before. We're becoming a much better vending company. 
If I look at the second quarter, we grew our business just under 2%. Our vending customers grew just under 3%. Those customers, like many of our customers, especially, in particular, industries heavily hit by either weaker energy prices or weaker activity in the industrial marketplace, our fastener business with vending customers was down 5% in the second quarter. So that group of customers that grew 3%, their fastener business with us was down 5%. I think that's an indicator of what's going on in their economic circumstance.
The non-fastener business for that same group of customers grew about 6%. And if I take it one step further, the dollars going through the vending machine grew about 11%. So what we're seeing is a group of customers -- about 45% of our revenue is with customers that have vending. Our revenue with that group of customers is growing at about twice the rate of our overall business as a company. That group of customers is as hurt by the economy as any other group, and you're seeing that shine through in the fastener business. And yet our non-fastener business continues to grow very well, and our business for the vending machine is growing double digit. 
We believe vending is an example of engagement with our customer, just like Onsite is an example of engagement with our customer. We believe we're building momentum that will serve us well in the years to follow.
The third piece of momentum I believe we're building is our CSP 16. I believe we're at about 1,900 stores converted. Our CSP 16 is largely in place with the revenue drivers of our business. And what I mean by that is there's some stores that have yet to convert. They might be smaller stores or stores that are in the process of moving, but they -- but our revenue base is largely complete as it relates to CSP 16. And that positions us to be a better same-day supplier to our customers, be a more efficient supplier to our customers and broaden our appeal on the range of customers that can buy from us. And I believe that will serve us well in the months and years to follow.
Finally, we have very good momentum on our national account signings. We highlighted that in the points raised. I believe it was on the second page of the press release. That's being helped by Onsite signings. Onsite signings are being helped by that. They serve each other well because 75% of our Onsites are with national account customers. That's the vision and, I believe, the momentum we're building as we go through 2016.
Now the perspective part and the part where, as I mentioned earlier, I think, frankly, I could have done better from the standpoint of providing perspective to the team at Fastenal. Our top 10 customers in the first quarter -- and our top 10 customers represent 8% to 10% of revenue, depending on the month or quarter you're looking at. That group was growing at about 14% in the first quarter, largely buoyed by a few customers that were new to that group. 
The key to that group every year is what is the new blood you're bringing into it and what are you doing with your existing group of customers that were in there in the past. And at the district level, we refer to that as our top 25. At the regional level, we refer to that as our top 300 customers. It's really what's happening with your big customers and what new customers are you bringing into that group. 
The growth for that group, which was double digit in the first quarter and was double digit in April, went to 0 in the month of May and went to negative 6% in the month of June. So in the second quarter, that group of customers grew at about 8%. 
If I look at the top 100 customers in our business, and again, they represent about 25% of our revenue, the top 10 I just talked about will be a subset, clearly, in the first quarter, that group of customers grew about 4.5%. In the month of April, that group of customers grew 6.5%. In the month of May, that group of customers contracted about 2%. In the month of June, that group of customers contracted about 2.5%. For the quarter, that group of customers, which grew almost 5%, 4.5% in the first quarter, grew 0.7% in the second quarter.
When I look at that group of customers, I see that sudden falloff as an example not of the momentum we're building but of slowdowns with momentum we've built in the past, with customers we've added in the past, where we have a large market presence. And that business fell off later in the quarter. The perspective part that we failed on is we didn't react fast enough locally and company-wide to that falling revenue in the month of May and June.
As it relates to gross margin, you'll notice a couple things omitted from our press release this quarter. One is a stated range, and that stated range was not removed because I felt it was accurate. It was removed because it was becoming too much noise to our conversation. I believe you own Fastenal because Fastenal is an organization that builds momentum and carries that momentum forward and is good enough at executing the business that we're able to capture that momentum in very attractive profit growth over time and very attractive returns.
Therefore, our focus internally is 90% on building the momentum. But in the case of gross margin, our gross margin dropped about 30 basis points during the quarter from the first quarter. About 25 basis points of that drop remain -- was tied to some of the activities around a very rapid CSP 16 rollout and really, more than that, a number of efficiencies we introduced into our store network, inventory by location -- they come under a bunch of names. 
What we're introducing -- and we want to do it very rapidly, maybe a little bit too rapidly, but we wanted to do it very rapidly to move forward. During that process, there were some components of our inventory we decided to sell off at a lower price. There were some components of our inventory that we decided to remove from our business. There's about 10 basis points of that drop that I believe are behind us. There's about 15 to 20 basis points of that drop that I believe will remain for several quarters. 
I was willing to move quickly on that as we entered the second quarter because I felt there were no other things we were doing that we could fund that, if you will, by other gross profit initiatives. Those didn't materialize, unfortunately, and the gross margin that you see as a result. 
And related to operating expenses, there's really probably 2 things that are noteworthy in our operating expenses. And Sheryl's going to touch on -- go a little more in depth on these and a few more. But the 2 things that jumped out for me -- our fuel costs were up about $2.5 million from Q1 to Q2, but that's a fact of the price of gasoline at the pump and diesel fuel at the pump. Where we didn't execute real well is we didn't react quickly to adjusting some of our store routes, our local routes, but more importantly, we didn't react very quickly to a propensity of charged freight, and therefore, we largely bore that expense without sharing that expense.
The second one, and this is a mechanical thing and it's something that I talked about with many of you over the last year on earnings calls, and that is historically, we have a very good flex in our operating expenses as it relates to incentive comp and what it means in the short term for our ability to absorb some worsening environments and a little bit of the incremental margin we give back in strong periods. And that is as we had gone through 2015, our incentive comp was compressing dramatically. And if you take a look for our proxy, you could see that from the standpoint of the impact on the executive compensation. But it contracted dramatically. And so the district and regional and store leadership component of that is at a compressed level, and so the ability to flex there is limited in the current environment. And you saw that shine through, unfortunately, in the current quarter.
Finally, 2 things I'll touch on, and they really relate to some momentum items I was -- we're discussing earlier. And that is, and we highlighted it, we installed during the quarter approximately 3,000 locker-leased devices under our locker lease program that we initiated earlier in the year with Walmart. The total rollout of that will be approximately 15,000 devices, and we'll roll out as we go through the balance of this year and, I believe, a little bit into early next year. We think it's an excellent program for us long term, and we entered into it. 
The second one is at our Investor Day last year, we unveiled our outdoor locker. As of today, we have approximately 30 outdoor store lockers in place. We expect to have about 50 by September. And while it's not very meaningful from a revenue perspective, and it won't be very meaningful from a revenue perspective when I look at '16 or '17, it's a step we're taking and one more means to be a much better supplier to our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Sheryl."

Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to",707,"I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to a store or some other type of selling location. 
During the first half of 2016, our payroll-related expenses increased due to the addition of personnel related to the acquisition of Fasteners Inc., which occurred in November of 2015, and the addition of vending specialists, information technology development resources and distribution personnel. And we also experienced an increase in our health care costs. 
These increases were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit-sharing contribution primarily due to lower sales growth and due to lower operating income, both on a dollar basis and a relative basis. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Regarding occupancy expenses, the increase in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 was driven by an increase in industrial vending equipment and also an increase in investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation, the largest impact related to the industrial vending equipment. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Selling and transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increased in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015. This was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and the timing of leased vehicle sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
During the second quarter of 2016, we did not repurchase any stock. However, in the first quarter of 2016, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share. We spent approximately $396 million buying back stock since June 30, 2014 and repurchased approximately 3.3% of our shares outstanding from the start of this time frame.
Regarding net capital expenditures, in the first half of 2016, our net capital expenditures expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were $86 million or 33.3% of net earnings. We expect our net capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million in 2016, and we plan to fund a portion of our planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of a private placement of debt. We expect to close on this funding in late July 2016.
Regarding operational working capital, on a year-over-year basis, our inventory grew by $108 million, and this growth was driven by the following factors: CSP 16 was approximately 50% of the increase; our international inventory growth was approximately 9% of the increase; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. related to 8% of the increase; Onsite and large customer impacts were approximately 14% of the increase.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings contracted slightly in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 due to our current initiative to add additional products into store inventory under our CSP 16 format. This was partially offset by a reduction in net cash used to fund accounts receivable. 
Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments, and this benefit reverses itself in the second, third and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September and December.  Our free cash flow year-to-date for 2016 is 63% of earnings, which compares to year-to-date 2015 at 66% of earnings. 
Last night, we announced a Q3 dividend of $0.30 per share. As a takeaway, I'd like to share with the group that we have a strong cash flow, and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.
And with that, I turn it over for questions from the group."

And part of the vending, I'm double counting because some of the vending would be to that group of customers and then what our store base would do. I really believe from just doing the math and assuming we can -- we have the horsepower, because I know the market's there, the horsepower to pull it off, which, I believe, we have or can add, that it's a business that, over a multiyear perspective, could grow in the low double digits. Now we need our store piece to execute well on that environment. We need our vending piece to execute well in that environment, but I believe that's achievable. If I'm wrong on the store piece and how much we can add there, it would translate that from a lower double digit to an upper single digit.

And when I look over the past 5 years in periods where you've grown 5% or greater, it's been about 25%. Should we assume that maybe 20% to 25% is a better range given the importance of Onsites in that growth algorithm?"

The one perspective that you -- the pathway to profit that's underlying in our business within our store network is still there. And so that store network will continue to see that tick up over time. But if we go from Onsites being 15% -- Onsites and customer sites, that group we talked about being mid-single -- mid-teens, among 15% of our business, and that effectively doubles over a 6- to 8-year horizon, it would take a little bit out of our incremental margin, yes."

In the case of the construction question you raised, the point I was making there is the fact that we saw it particularly weak with energy customers, and I don't know that there's enough -- I don't know if the oil price is such that there's going to be a rush back to any kind of new construction there, new activity there. I think it's going to be idle for a period of time. In the case of fasteners, again, that was very much related -- that was amplified by the fact that we had some large customers that were shut down and really hit the radar. And what you really see when that shutdown occurs, it hits the OEM fastener because they're shutting down their production. They're still doing some maintenance, so you might not see it in the non-fastener, but you see it in the fastener number."

I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January, unofficially stepped into the role last Octobe",2631,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our earnings call for the second quarter of 2016. I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January, unofficially stepped into the role last October. I'm a firm believer, and I have some CEOs that came before me at Fastenal that did an excellent job of doing 2 things: providing vision to the -- to our shareholders and to the employees of Fastenal and providing perspective periodically on what we are building for course correction as we go through a period of time.
In the case of vision, I'd like to believe the vision that we laid out last November in our Investor Day and the vision that we believe, I believe, is the correct one for Fastenal, is being presented in a meaningful fashion. I think we're seeing traction on that.
From the vantage point of the second item, perspective, perspective is looking at the business in my mind as you go through the quarter. Again, pointing things out. As you look through the quarter, you go through the year, you go through the month, pointing things out and seeing a cause and effect from the standpoint of a reaction and improvement on certain things. Or you accelerate on certain things that aren't moving fast enough.
In that regard, I would have to say I let the Fastenal organization and our shareholders down in the second quarter because there were some missteps we made. But let's look at vision first. We talked last November about the vision of Fastenal. And one thing that I think is critical to our success as we go forth in this year and into the years to follow is the momentum we're building as an organization. One of the hallmarks of the organization that I've known for, well, just over 20 years -- in June, I hit 20 years with Fastenal, a milestone I'm particularly proud of -- is the fact that we are an organization that builds momentum. Whether that momentum is coming from the opening of stores, the adding of people, the signing of and installing of vending machines, we are an organization that creates momentum for ourselves, and that allows us to separate in the marketplace our ability to grow long term. We operate in a large market. We have a large opportunity, and it's upon us to build the momentum to go out and take that opportunity.
We didn't have great momentum coming into the year, and you see that shining through in some of our numbers this quarter, and I'll get into a few more specifics in a second. But on the building of momentum front, in the first 6 months of this year, we signed 92 Onsites, 48 in the first quarter, 44 in the second quarter. Our stated goal is to sign 200 for the year. 
Personally, I want to have no quarter that doesn't start with at least a 4, and it'd be great to have a quarter or 2 that starts with a 5. So far, I believe in the first 2 quarters of the year, we've made a tremendous transition in our ability to sign Onsites. 
And Onsites, for those of you not familiar with it, is really about us setting up a store inside the customer's facility and having an even more intimate relationship than we've had in the past. We have currently 333, I believe that's the number, Onsites that are operating. Of the 92, we've turned on, I believe, close to 50 Onsites. But we're making very good progress on changing the organization to start building that momentum that we'll need as we go into '17, '18 and beyond. 
In regards to vending, in the first 2 quarters of this year, we signed 9,516 devices, and we signed more in the second quarter than the first quarter. Earlier in the year, we added roughly 230 people into our business to support vending and to drive our signings with vendings. And I'll touch on a few stats in a second of why that's important, but I'm proud to say that we're gaining some momentum there. 
Part of the process with this new group of people was to go out and optimize our existing devices. In many cases, that optimization involved adding products into the machines to improve the throughput of the machine. In some cases, it was changing the configuration of the machines to improve the efficiency of replenishing the machine. And so an optimization isn't all revenue-based; it might be a service-based aspect. But we've optimized approximately 75% of our machines in the first 6 months of the year. That's the good news.
The second set of good news is we continue to see good statistics out of the group of stores. The bad news is it also required the removal of a certain number of machines. We removed 7,200 machines in the first 6 months of this year as we went through our optimization process. Many of those machines are great decisions -- that we removed are great decisions because we went from 10 machines to 9. We went from 4 machines to 3 because we really rationalized the equipment we needed to support that customer, and that's a great decision because it allows us to get a better return on that asset that's deployed. 
Unfortunately, some of the machines we removed were examples where we had a machine in an environment where either the business had changed or the business never truly justified a vending machine, and we went from 1 to 0 or 2 to 0. But I believe we have a much better business -- vending business today than we had 6 months ago, and we continue to see great traction in our signings. And every day, we're doing a better job vetting new signings than we did the day before. We're becoming a much better vending company. 
If I look at the second quarter, we grew our business just under 2%. Our vending customers grew just under 3%. Those customers, like many of our customers, especially, in particular, industries heavily hit by either weaker energy prices or weaker activity in the industrial marketplace, our fastener business with vending customers was down 5% in the second quarter. So that group of customers that grew 3%, their fastener business with us was down 5%. I think that's an indicator of what's going on in their economic circumstance.
The non-fastener business for that same group of customers grew about 6%. And if I take it one step further, the dollars going through the vending machine grew about 11%. So what we're seeing is a group of customers -- about 45% of our revenue is with customers that have vending. Our revenue with that group of customers is growing at about twice the rate of our overall business as a company. That group of customers is as hurt by the economy as any other group, and you're seeing that shine through in the fastener business. And yet our non-fastener business continues to grow very well, and our business through the vending machine is growing double digit. 
We believe vending is an example of engagement with our customer, just like Onsite is an example of engagement with our customer. We believe we're building momentum that will serve us well in the years to follow.
The third piece of momentum I believe we're building is our CSP 16. I believe we're at about 1,900 stores converted. Our CSP 16 is largely in place with the revenue drivers of our business. And what I mean by that is there's some stores that have yet to convert. They might be smaller stores or stores that are in the process of moving, but they -- but our revenue base is largely complete as it relates to CSP 16. And that positions us to be a better same-day supplier to our customers, be a more efficient supplier to our customers and broaden our appeal on the range of customers that can buy from us. And I believe that will serve us well in the months and years to follow.
Finally, we have very good momentum on our national account signings. We highlighted that in the points raised. I believe it was on the second page of the press release. That's being helped by Onsite signings. Onsite signings are being helped by that. They serve each other well because 75% of our Onsites are with national account customers. That's the vision and, I believe, the momentum we're building as we go through 2016.
Now the perspective part and the part where, as I mentioned earlier, I think, frankly, I could have done better from the standpoint of providing perspective to the team at Fastenal. Our top 10 customers in the first quarter -- and our top 10 customers represent 8% to 10% of revenue, depending on the month or quarter you're looking at -- that group was growing at about 14% in the first quarter, largely buoyed by a few customers that were new to that group. 
The key to that group every year is what is the new blood you're bringing into it and what are you doing with your existing group of customers that were in there in the past. And at the district level, we refer to that as our top 25. At the regional level, we refer to that as our top 300 customers. It's really what's happening with your big customers and what new customers are you bringing into that group. 
The growth for that group, which was double digit in the first quarter and was double digit in April, went to 0 in the month of May and went to negative 6% in the month of June. So in the second quarter, that group of customers grew at about 8%. 
If I look at the top 100 customers in our business, and again, they represent about 25% of our revenue -- the top 10 I just talked about would be a subset, clearly. In the first quarter, that group of customers grew about 4.5%. In the month of April, that group of customers grew 6.5%. In the month of May, that group of customers contracted about 2%. In the month of June, that group of customers contracted about 2.5%. For the quarter, that group of customers, which grew almost 5%, 4.5% in the first quarter, grew 0.7% in the second quarter.
When I look at that group of customers, I see that sudden falloff as an example not of the momentum we're building but of slowdowns with momentum we've built in the past, with customers we've added in the past, where we have a large market presence. And that business fell off later in the quarter. The perspective part that we failed on is we didn't react fast enough locally and company-wide to that falling revenue in the months of May and June.
As it relates to gross margin, you'll notice a couple things omitted from our press release this quarter. One is a stated range, and that stated range was not removed because I felt it was accurate. It was removed because it was becoming too much noise to our conversation. I believe you own Fastenal because Fastenal is an organization that builds momentum and carries that momentum forward and is good enough at executing the business that we're able to capture that momentum in very attractive profit growth over time and very attractive returns.
Therefore, our focus internally is 90% on building the momentum. But in the case of gross margin, our gross margin dropped about 30 basis points during the quarter from the first quarter. About 25 basis points of that drop remain -- was tied to some of the activities around a very rapid CSP 16 rollout and really, more than that, a number of efficiencies we introduced into our store network, inventory by location -- they come under a bunch of names. 
What we're introducing -- and we wanted to do it very rapidly, maybe a little bit too rapidly, but we wanted to do it very rapidly to move forward. During that process, there were some components of our inventory we decided to sell off at a lower price. There were some components of our inventory that we decided to remove from our business. There's about 10 basis points of that drop that I believe are behind us. There's about 15 to 20 basis points of that drop that I believe will remain for several quarters. 
I was willing to move quickly on that as we entered the second quarter because I felt there were -- other things we were doing that we could fund that, if you will, by other gross profit initiatives. Those didn't materialize, unfortunately, and the gross margin that you see as a result. 
And related to operating expenses, there's really probably 2 things that are noteworthy in our operating expenses. And Sheryl's going to touch on -- go a little more in depth on these and a few more. But the 2 things that jump out for me -- our fuel costs were up about $2.5 million from Q1 to Q2, but that's a fact of the price of gasoline at the pump and diesel fuel at the pump. Where we didn't execute real well is we didn't react quickly to adjusting some of our store routes, our local routes, but more importantly, we didn't react very quickly to our propensity to charge freight, and therefore, we largely bore that expense without sharing that expense.
The second one, and this is a mechanical thing and it's something that I talked about with many of you over the last year on earnings calls, and that is historically, we have a very good flex in our operating expenses as it relates to incentive comp and what it means in the short term for our ability to absorb some worsening environments and a little bit of the incremental margin we give back in strong periods. And that is as we had gone through 2015, our incentive comp was compressing dramatically. And if you take a look through our proxy, you could see that from the standpoint of the impact on the executive compensation. But it contracted dramatically. And so the district and regional and store leadership component of that is at a compressed level, and so the ability to flex there is limited in the current environment. And you saw that shine through, unfortunately, in the current quarter.
Finally, 2 things I'll touch on, and it really relates to the momentum items I was discussing earlier. And that is, and we highlighted it, we installed during the quarter approximately 3,000 locker-lease devices under our locker lease program that we initiated earlier in the year with Walmart. The total rollout of that will be approximately 15,000 devices, and we'll roll out as we go through the balance of this year and, I believe, a little bit into early next year. We think it's an excellent program for us long term, and we entered into it. 
The second one is at our Investor Day last year, we unveiled our outdoor locker. As of today, we have approximately 30 outdoor store lockers in place. We expect to have about 50 by September. And while it's not very meaningful from a revenue perspective, and it won't be very meaningful from a revenue perspective when I look at '16 or '17, it's a step we're taking and one more means to be a much better supplier to our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Sheryl."
270747,369244603,1006015,"Fastenal Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 12, 2016",2016-07-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to",708,"I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to a store or some other type of selling location. 
During the first half of 2016, our payroll-related expenses increased due to the addition of personnel related to the acquisition of Fasteners Inc., which occurred in November of 2015, and the addition of vending specialists, information technology development resources and distribution personnel. And we also experienced an increase in our health care costs. 
These increases were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit-sharing contribution primarily due to lower sales growth and due to lower operating income, both on a dollar basis and a relative basis. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Regarding occupancy expenses, the increase in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 was driven by an increase in industrial vending equipment and also an increase in investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation, the largest impact related to the industrial vending equipment. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Selling and transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increased in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015. This was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and the timing of leased vehicle sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
During the second quarter of 2016, we did not repurchase any stock. However, in the first quarter of 2016, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share. We spent approximately $396 million buying back stock since June 30 of 2014 and repurchased approximately 3.3% of our shares outstanding from the start of this time frame.
Regarding net capital expenditures, in the first half of 2016, our net capital expenditures expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were $86 million or 33.3% of net earnings. We expect our net capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million in 2016, and we plan to fund a portion of our planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of a private placement of debt. We expect to close on this funding in late July 2016.
Regarding operational working capital, on a year-over-year basis, our inventory grew by $108 million, and this growth was driven by the following factors: CSP 16 was approximately 50% of the increase; our international inventory growth was approximately 9% of the increase; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. related to 8% of the increase; Onsite and large customer impacts were approximately 14% of the increase.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings contracted slightly in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 due to our current initiative to add additional products into store inventory under our CSP 16 format. This was partially offset by a reduction in net cash used to fund accounts receivable. 
Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments, and this benefit reverses itself in the second, third and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September and December.  Our free cash flow year-to-date for 2016 is 63% of earnings, which compares to year-to-date 2015 at 66% of earnings. 
Last night, we announced a Q3 dividend of $0.30 per share. As a takeaway, I'd like to share with the group that we have a strong cash flow, and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.
And with that, I turn it over for questions from the group."

And part of the vending I'm double counting because some of the vending would be to that group of customers and then what our store base would do. I really believe from just doing the math and assuming we can -- we have the horsepower, because I know the market's there, the horsepower to pull it off, which, I believe, we have or can add, that it's a business that, over a multiyear perspective, could grow in the low double digits. Now we need our store piece to execute well in that environment. We need our vending piece to execute well in that environment, but I believe that's achievable. If I'm wrong on the store piece and how much we can add there, it would translate that from a lower double digit to an upper single digit.

And so I'm not sure if I addressed your fastener-side question because fasteners and vending really don't go hand in hand.

In the case of the construction question you raised, the point I was making there is the fact that we saw it particularly weak with energy customers, and I don't know that there's enough -- I don't know if the oil price is such that there's going to be a rush back to any kind of new construction there, new activity there. I think it's going to be idle for a period of time. In the case of fasteners, again, that was very much related -- that was amplified by the fact that we had some large customers that were shut down and it really hit the radar. And what you really see when that shutdown occurs, it hits the OEM fastener because they're shutting down their production. They're still doing some maintenance, so you might not see it in the non-fastener, but you see it in the fastener number."

I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January, unofficially stepped into the role last Octobe",2631,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our earnings call for the second quarter of 2016. I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President for -- I'm in my 7 month, started it in January, unofficially stepped into the role last October. I'm a firm believer, and I have some CEOs that came before me at Fastenal that did an excellent job of doing 2 things: providing vision to the -- to our shareholders and to the employees of Fastenal and providing perspective periodically on what we are building for course correction as we go through a period of time.
In the case of vision, I'd like to believe the vision that we laid out last November in our Investor Day and the vision that we believe, I believe, is the correct one for Fastenal, is being presented in a meaningful fashion. I think we're seeing traction on that.
From the vantage point of the second item, perspective, perspective is looking at the business in my mind as you go through the quarter. Again, pointing things out. As you look through the quarter, you go through the year, you go through the month, pointing things out and seeing a cause and effect from the standpoint of a reaction and improvement on certain things. Or you accelerate on certain things that aren't moving fast enough.
In that regard, I would have to say I let the Fastenal organization and our shareholders down in the second quarter because there were some missteps we made. But let's look at vision first. We talked last November about the vision of Fastenal. And one thing that I think is critical to our success as we go forth in this year and into the years to follow is the momentum we're building as an organization. One of the hallmarks of the organization that I've known for, well, just over 20 years -- in June, I hit 20 years with Fastenal, a milestone I'm particularly proud of -- is the fact that we are an organization that builds momentum. Whether that momentum is coming from the opening of stores, the adding of people, the signing of and installing of vending machines, we are an organization that creates momentum for ourselves, and that allows us to separate in the marketplace our ability to grow long term. We operate in a large market. We have a large opportunity, and it's upon us to build the momentum to go out and take that opportunity.
We didn't have great momentum coming into the year, and you see that shining through in some of our numbers this quarter, and I'll get into a few more specifics in a second. But on the building of momentum front, in the first 6 months of this year, we signed 92 Onsites, 48 in the first quarter, 44 in the second quarter. Our stated goal is to sign 200 for the year. 
Personally, I want to have no quarter that doesn't start with at least a 4, and it'd be great to have a quarter or 2 that starts with a 5. So far, I believe in the first 2 quarters of the year, we've made a tremendous transition in our ability to sign Onsites. 
And Onsites, for those of you not familiar with it, is really about us setting up a store inside the customer's facility and having an even more intimate relationship than we've had in the past. We have currently 333, I believe that's the number, Onsites that are operating. Of the 92, we've turned on, I believe, close to 50 Onsites. But we're making very good progress on changing the organization to start building that momentum that we'll need as we go into '17, '18 and beyond. 
In regards to vending, in the first 2 quarters of this year, we signed 9,516 devices, and we signed more in the second quarter than the first quarter. Earlier in the year, we added roughly 230 people into our business to support vending and to drive our signings with vendings. And I'll touch on a few stats in a second of why that's important, but I'm proud to say that we're gaining some momentum there. 
Part of the process with this new group of people was to go out and optimize our existing devices. In many cases, that optimization involved adding products into the machines to improve the throughput of the machine. In some cases, it was changing the configuration of the machines to improve the efficiency of replenishing the machine. And so an optimization isn't all revenue-based; it might be a service-based aspect. But we've optimized approximately 75% of our machines in the first 6 months of the year. That's the good news.
The second set of good news is we continue to see good statistics out of the group of stores. The bad news is it also required the removal of a certain number of machines. We removed 7,200 machines in the first 6 months of this year as we went through our optimization process. Many of those machines are great decisions -- that we removed are great decisions because we went from 10 machines to 9. We went from 4 machines to 3 because we really rationalized the equipment we needed to support that customer, and that's a great decision because it allows us to get a better return on that asset that's deployed. 
Unfortunately, some of the machines we removed were examples where we had a machine in an environment where either the business had changed or the business never truly justified a vending machine, and we went from 1 to 0 or 2 to 0. But I believe we have a much better business -- vending business today than we had 6 months ago, and we continue to see great traction in our signings. And every day, we're doing a better job vetting new signings than we did the day before. We're becoming a much better vending company. 
If I look at the second quarter, we grew our business just under 2%. Our vending customers grew just under 3%. Those customers, like many of our customers, especially, in particular, industries heavily hit by either weaker energy prices or weaker activity in the industrial marketplace, our fastener business with vending customers was down 5% in the second quarter. So that group of customers that grew 3%, their fastener business with us was down 5%. I think that's an indicator of what's going on in their economic circumstance.
The non-fastener business for that same group of customers grew about 6%. And if I take it one step further, the dollars going through the vending machine grew about 11%. So what we're seeing is a group of customers -- about 45% of our revenue is with customers that have vending. Our revenue with that group of customers is growing at about twice the rate of our overall business as a company. That group of customers is as hurt by the economy as any other group, and you're seeing that shine through in the fastener business. And yet our non-fastener business continues to grow very well, and our business through the vending machine is growing double digit. 
We believe vending is an example of engagement with our customer, just like Onsite is an example of engagement with our customer. We believe we're building momentum that will serve us well in the years to follow.
The third piece of momentum I believe we're building is our CSP 16. I believe we're at about 1,900 stores converted. Our CSP 16 is largely in place with the revenue drivers of our business. And what I mean by that is there's some stores that have yet to convert. They might be smaller stores or stores that are in the process of moving, but they -- but our revenue base is largely complete as it relates to CSP 16. And that positions us to be a better same-day supplier to our customers, be a more efficient supplier to our customers and broaden our appeal on the range of customers that can buy from us. And I believe that will serve us well in the months and years to follow.
Finally, we have very good momentum on our national account signings. We highlighted that in the points raised. I believe it was on the second page of the press release. That's being helped by Onsite signings. Onsite signings are being helped by that. They serve each other well because 75% of our Onsites are with national account customers. That's the vision and, I believe, the momentum we're building as we go through 2016.
Now the perspective part and the part where, as I mentioned earlier, I think, frankly, I could have done better from the standpoint of providing perspective to the team at Fastenal. Our top 10 customers in the first quarter -- and our top 10 customers represent 8% to 10% of revenue, depending on the month or quarter you're looking at -- that group was growing at about 14% in the first quarter, largely buoyed by a few customers that were new to that group. 
The key to that group every year is what is the new blood you're bringing into it and what are you doing with your existing group of customers that were in there in the past. And at the district level, we refer to that as our top 25. At the regional level, we refer to that as our top 300 customers. It's really what's happening with your big customers and what new customers are you bringing into that group. 
The growth for that group, which was double digit in the first quarter and was double digit in April, went to 0 in the month of May and went to negative 6% in the month of June. So in the second quarter, that group of customers grew at about 8%. 
If I look at the top 100 customers in our business, and again, they represent about 25% of our revenue -- the top 10 I just talked about would be a subset, clearly. In the first quarter, that group of customers grew about 4.5%. In the month of April, that group of customers grew 6.5%. In the month of May, that group of customers contracted about 2%. In the month of June, that group of customers contracted about 2.5%. For the quarter, that group of customers, which grew almost 5%, 4.5% in the first quarter, grew 0.7% in the second quarter.
When I look at that group of customers, I see that sudden falloff as an example not of the momentum we're building but of slowdowns with momentum we've built in the past, with customers we've added in the past, where we have a large market presence. And that business fell off later in the quarter. The perspective part that we failed on is we didn't react fast enough locally and company-wide to that falling revenue in the months of May and June.
As it relates to gross margin, you'll notice a couple things omitted from our press release this quarter. One is a stated range, and that stated range was not removed because I felt it was accurate. It was removed because it was becoming too much noise to our conversation. I believe you own Fastenal because Fastenal is an organization that builds momentum and carries that momentum forward and is good enough at executing the business that we're able to capture that momentum in very attractive profit growth over time and very attractive returns.
Therefore, our focus internally is 90% on building the momentum. But in the case of gross margin, our gross margin dropped about 30 basis points during the quarter from the first quarter. About 25 basis points of that drop remain -- was tied to some of the activities around a very rapid CSP 16 rollout and really, more than that, a number of efficiencies we introduced into our store network, inventory by location -- they come under a bunch of names. 
What we're introducing -- and we wanted to do it very rapidly, maybe a little bit too rapidly, but we wanted to do it very rapidly to move forward. During that process, there were some components of our inventory we decided to sell off at a lower price. There were some components of our inventory that we decided to remove from our business. There's about 10 basis points of that drop that I believe are behind us. There's about 15 to 20 basis points of that drop that I believe will remain for several quarters. 
I was willing to move quickly on that as we entered the second quarter because I felt there were -- other things we were doing that we could fund that, if you will, by other gross profit initiatives. Those didn't materialize, unfortunately, and the gross margin that you see as a result. 
And related to operating expenses, there's really probably 2 things that are noteworthy in our operating expenses. And Sheryl's going to touch on -- go a little more in depth on these and a few more. But the 2 things that jump out for me -- our fuel costs were up about $2.5 million from Q1 to Q2, but that's a fact of the price of gasoline at the pump and diesel fuel at the pump. Where we didn't execute real well is we didn't react quickly to adjusting some of our store routes, our local routes, but more importantly, we didn't react very quickly to our propensity to charge freight, and therefore, we largely bore that expense without sharing that expense.
The second one, and this is a mechanical thing and it's something that I talked about with many of you over the last year on earnings calls, and that is historically, we have a very good flex in our operating expenses as it relates to incentive comp and what it means in the short term for our ability to absorb some worsening environments and a little bit of the incremental margin we give back in strong periods. And that is as we had gone through 2015, our incentive comp was compressing dramatically. And if you take a look through our proxy, you could see that from the standpoint of the impact on the executive compensation. But it contracted dramatically. And so the district and regional and store leadership component of that is at a compressed level, and so the ability to flex there is limited in the current environment. And you saw that shine through, unfortunately, in the current quarter.
Finally, 2 things I'll touch on, and it really relates to the momentum items I was discussing earlier. And that is, and we highlighted it, we installed during the quarter approximately 3,000 locker-lease devices under our locker lease program that we initiated earlier in the year with Walmart. The total rollout of that will be approximately 15,000 devices, and we'll roll out as we go through the balance of this year and, I believe, a little bit into early next year. We think it's an excellent program for us long term, and we entered into it. 
The second one is at our Investor Day last year, we unveiled our outdoor locker. As of today, we have approximately 30 outdoor store lockers in place. We expect to have about 50 by September. And while it's not very meaningful from a revenue perspective, and it won't be very meaningful from a revenue perspective when I look at '16 or '17, it's a step we're taking and one more means to be a much better supplier to our customers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Sheryl."
270747,369244603,1006153,"Fastenal Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 12, 2016",2016-07-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to",708,"I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee-related expenses, we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to a store or some other type of selling location. 
During the first half of 2016, our payroll-related expenses increased due to the addition of personnel related to the acquisition of Fasteners Inc., which occurred in November of 2015, and the addition of vending specialists, information technology development resources and distribution personnel. And we also experienced an increase in our health care costs. 
These increases were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit-sharing contribution primarily due to lower sales growth and due to lower operating income, both on a dollar basis and a relative basis. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Regarding occupancy expenses, the increase in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 was driven by an increase in industrial vending equipment and also an increase in investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation, the largest impact related to the industrial vending equipment. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
Selling and transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increased in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015. This was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and the timing of leased vehicle sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the 6-month period.
During the second quarter of 2016, we did not repurchase any stock. However, in the first quarter of 2016, we purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share. We spent approximately $396 million buying back stock since June 30 of 2014 and repurchased approximately 3.3% of our shares outstanding from the start of this time frame.
Regarding net capital expenditures, in the first half of 2016, our net capital expenditures expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were $86 million or 33.3% of net earnings. We expect our net capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million in 2016, and we plan to fund a portion of our planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of a private placement of debt. We expect to close on this funding in late July 2016.
Regarding operational working capital, on a year-over-year basis, our inventory grew by $108 million, and this growth was driven by the following factors: CSP 16 was approximately 50% of the increase; our international inventory growth was approximately 9% of the increase; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc. related to 8% of the increase; Onsite and large customer impacts were approximately 14% of the increase.
From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings contracted slightly in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 due to our current initiative to add additional products into store inventory under our CSP 16 format. This was partially offset by a reduction in net cash used to fund accounts receivable. 
Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments, and this benefit reverses itself in the second, third and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September and December. Our free cash flow year-to-date for 2016 is 63% of earnings, which compares to year-to-date 2015 at 66% of earnings. 
Last night, we announced a Q3 dividend of $0.30 per share. As a takeaway, I'd like to share with the group that we have a strong cash flow, and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.
And with that, I turn it over for questions from the group."

And part of the vending I'm double counting because some of the vending would be to that group of customers and then what our store base would do. I really believe from just doing the math and assuming we can -- we have the horsepower, because I know the market's there, the horsepower to pull it off, which, I believe, we have or can add, that it's a business that, over a multiyear perspective, could grow in the low double digits. Now we need our store piece to execute well in that environment. We need our vending piece to execute well in that environment, but I believe that's achievable. If I'm wrong on the store piece and how much we can add there, it would translate that from a lower double digit to an upper single digit.

I have not had discussions with my board about going deeper than that. However, what I found in the past is it's a board willing to discuss it.

And so we've demonstrated a willingness to do in the past. I believe the willingness would exist during the future, and I'll couch it with one caveat. We are boringly Midwestern conservative, and it took us some discussions to take on the first layer of debt that we did, but we also looked at it from the standpoint -- from a financial decision. I don't want to say it was a no-brainer, but it was an easy decision.

In the case of the construction question you raised, the point I was making there is the fact that we saw it particularly weak with energy customers, and I don't know that there's enough -- I don't know if the oil price is such that there's going to be a rush back to any kind of new construction there, new activity there. I think it's going to be idle for a period of time. In the case of fasteners, again, that was very much related -- that was amplified by the fact that we had some large customers that were shut down and it really hit the radar. And what you really see when that shutdown occurs, it hits the OEM fastener because they're shutting down their production. They're still doing some maintenance, so you might not see it in the non-fastener, but you see it in the fastener number."

Holden's been now for, I believe, 5.5 -- about [ph] 5.5 weeks so he's a seasoned veteran at the Fastenal organization.
When we started 2016, had a handful of expectations for the year. And I thought I'd run through those expectations and talk a little bit about how the year's played out relative to those expectations.
First expectation for the year, we're going to open some stores. We hadn't opened much stores in recent years. We're going to open a few more stores, not a lot but a few more because that is part of our long-term growth, and it's about always exploring ways to grow in different markets. 
The second thing we were going to do is we're going to reinvigorate our store network. We talked about CSP 16 at our Investor Day last November. Essentially, we injected about $75 million of inventory in our store network to be a better supplier, a more efficient supplier and a better same-day supplier. And we're pretty good already but let's get better.
Third item, let's reinvigorate our vending. We've created a wonderful vending business in the last 5 years. But in the last 2 years, we've lost some steam. In 2014 and 2015, we had -- we were signing about 4,000 a quarter, so we were -- had run rates of about 16,000 a year and really saw, there's a lot more potential there and our capabilities are strong and this naturally works with our store and on-site network. Let's go back to this more aggressively.
The fourth, speaking of our on-site network, let's transition to an on-site mentality for growth. History says we will sign about 5 to 10 a year. In 2015, we had started a transition. We signed about 80. Could we sign 200 in 2016? 
5, our comps are going to [indiscernible] Sorry about that, folks. I'm not sure where that came from. Our comps, we're going to ease a bit in Q3 with a [indiscernible] from mid-single-digit growth in sales and gives us a little more flexibility on what we could afford to spend as we approach the year. Let's focus on our growth drivers in 2016. Let's demonstrate to ourselves and others that we can grow in this environment. And let our regional vice presidents, our district manager group, our hub manager group, our support leads run their businesses. It's an incredibly talented group. They run an incredibly impressive business. Let them run it. Let's focus on our growth drivers. 
And Point 7, 8, 9 and 10, serve your customers, serve them everyday, improve their business and ours and be creative, we will grow. What are some of the realities of the year? We are opening some stores. We'll open about 30 -- we'll have opened between 35 and 40 stores for the year. I think that's a good number for us in 2016. 
One item that changed on our stores is in May of 2016, the Department of Labor published some new rules regarding exempt employees. This rule, while it doesn't impact our company in totality because it essentially raised the threshold of what qualifies as an exempt employee from -- there's rules for duties that qualify you and there's also a rule for pay, and those rules were increased dramatically in 2016. 
Because of that change, it does impact our smaller stores because in our smaller stores, we don't always compensate above that $48,000 level because we have folks that are building a business and we're a sales-minded organization but the opportunity is huge. But as you all know from the years of us publishing our pathway to profit data, stores under $75,000 amount are not profitable -- are marginally profitable, and this damages that. And we decided to close some stores. 
We moved fairly aggressively on it. We closed 65 stores in Q3. We have another 32 stores queued up to close in Q4, and we're also evaluating another group we're going to look at in 2017. But because of the close to 100 stores that we identified for closure, we did book up a reserve in the third quarter for those closures primarily related to the occupancy, but we move fairly quickly on it. 
These closures should have a minimum impact on our revenue similar to closures in the past because the stores have another -- these locations have another store and recently close proximity. And as you know from previous conversations, the vast majority of our revenue is business-to-business, most of it going out our back door, we're delivering to the customer sites. So for serving a market with 5 stores versus 4 stores or 3 stores versus 4 stores doesn't necessarily change our ability to grow or our ability to maintain the business we have. And typically, we maintain 90-plus percent of the business when we close a store. 
But it did change a bit of our thought process as we've gone through the year just because of the changing landscape, the reality we live in. CSP 16, we moved aggressively on that early in the year. Our store conversion is largely behind us. We believe this broadens our ability, as I mentioned earlier, be a better same-day supplier, appeal to a broader range of customers. We believe that ultimately, this will help us as we go on in 2017 with our construction customer. But we believe it makes us a more efficient business. 
On vending, our run rate has improved. We've been signing 4,700 to 4,800 per quarter instead of the closer to 4,000 we were doing the last 2 years. Right now, our run rate, if you just take that number and annualize it, it's about a 19,000 run rate versus the 16,000 the last couple of years. This is okay, it's not great. We added 200-and-some people earlier in the year to ramp this number up. That ramp has been moving a little bit slower than I would have liked. I'd like the quarterly number to start with a 5 versus a 4 but we've improved it nicely. 
And I also have to acknowledge the fact that as you all know from previous calls, we signed a rather sizable vending leasing program earlier in the first half of the year, and we've deployed in the last 4 months roughly 11,000 vending machines into that program. And that's created a little bit of distraction to our program, but I'd still like a number that starts with a 5. But we've made nice progress. 
Regarding the transition to Onsite, I'm frankly impressed with our team. We still have work to do but I'm impressed with the fact that we've signed 133 year-to-date. That put us on pace to do roughly 180. Our record year last year was 80. I believe we're creating momentum for our business into the future because the closer we get to the customer, whether that be with our store network, our vending platform or our Onsite, history has demonstrated we take market share when we do that because we have a heart within our organization. 
Our covenant with our customer, we will help you be a better business by being a great supplier and a great partner to you, and the Onsite strategy only makes that better. And I'm very pleased with the transition we're making and that I expect us to continue making as we enter 2017.
Point 5, the comps were easing in the third quarter, and that will help us. Unfortunately, we're still stuck in that band of 1 [ph] to 3 [ph] If you look at it from Q2 to Q3, our sales are treading water but there's 2 stories going on in there. Our fastener business continues to be weak. That business has been weak since the spring of 2015, and our fastener revenue dropped about $10 million from Q2 to Q3. 
Under the hood, our fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. Under the hood, our non-fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. We didn't execute that -- we haven't been executing that well, in my opinion, in 2016 in general on our freight. Our potential to charge freight has weakened in the last 6, 7 quarters. Lower fuel prices, and it's part of the reason, discipline is the other, perhaps the marketplace is making it a little bit more challenging to charge freight. But there's still ample examples where we can charge it we're not, and we need to be better at executing on that front. But the product margins under the hood again, we have mix going against us because the fastener business was down about $10 million. We continue to see us inching along in improving the relative gross margin on the components.
If sales are up 5% and -- 5%, 6% as we were expecting, the fact that our expenses are up a little bit above 5%, would be okay, wouldn't be great but it'd be okay. Unfortunately, that's not the fact pattern and we're pulling some levers on expenses. One of those levers that we're pulling is to help offset some of the impacts as we go into 2017 to offset some of the investment impacts we made in 2016. 
The regulatory environment, well, you all watch the news, I'm not sharing a secret here. It's not a great environment to do business in. But that's the world we live in and that's the world we need to contend with. And there's a lot of uncertainty. But the certainty I do know is that we have a great organization, a great group of people out there managing our business. And we're going to continue to focus on our growth drivers, and we're going to continue to let our regional vice presidents, our district managers, our hub managers, our support leads run their perspective groups. 
But we'll need to be mindful of the environment we're in. It's a different earnings call for me this quarter and as the last couple of quarters have been in that I don't have much spreadsheets set in front of me ready to answer any and every question, just talking about the business. And I'm upbeat about our business as I look forward. There's a lot of good things from a momentum standpoint but it was a tough quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

In terms of the revenues, total and daily sales in the third quarter were both up 1.8%. That's the third straight quarter where we've seen daily sales growth between that 1.5% and 2% range. 
We did like that the quarter finished in September with a daily sales rate up 2.8%. But as you all know, the comparison did get quite a bit easier, and that's a pattern that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. Qualitatively, it's not clear to us that the tone changed much in the third quarter. We saw that the sales of fasteners have a manufacturing construction and markets were relatively weak as we've seen before. 
The same could be said of our largest customers. Our top 100 was flat to maybe down slightly during the period. But again, these are the same dynamics that have persisted throughout 2016. If there was any incremental change, it may have been that the U.S. business grew a little less quickly while Canada and Mexico actually strengthened. But at the end of the day, it all blended in what we thought was a fairly consistent quarterly sales performance. 
This sluggishness does mask the progress we're making on our growth drivers. Dan alluded to some of this, but we did sign over 4,700 vending machines in the third quarter. Our total installed base rose by more than 2,000 units. We now have 60,000 -- more than 60,000 in the field. That's a figure that does not include the machines that are related to our leased locker program, which is being rolled out as we expected it to be. 
We also signed 41 Onsites in the third quarter. We're up to about 133 year-to-date. The SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative are growing faster than the company as a whole. And we'll provide some additional insights into the CSP 16 and Onsite initiatives after the fourth quarter. But again, overall, we think that those initiatives are proceeding nicely.
In terms of gross profit, our gross margin was 49.3% in the third quarter. That's down 120 basis points annually and that's down 20 basis points versus last quarter. We discussed the gross margin ramifications related to the relative growth of our non-fastener large customer mix in the short and intermediate term, and that dynamic was significant in the annual decline we saw this quarter. In particular, fasteners that you saw as a percentage of sales, that's down 180 basis points year-over-year to 36.1%. That does have an impact on our gross margin overall.
There was also a factor in our modest sequential decline. But that said, we were a bit disappointed that the gross margins slipped in the third quarter. We looked at the gross margin of the fastener and non-fastener categories. They remain stable. We did good work there. We don't believe that we saw any meaningful pressure within the product categories themselves. 
We did see higher freight costs this quarter. That relates to both the weak demand, also perhaps our own diligence around inventory levels during the quarter. But regardless, the freight was a significant contributor to the downward drift we saw in the sequential gross margin Q2 to Q3 of '16. 
In terms of operating expenses, our operating margin was 20% in the quarter. That's down 210 basis points annually and down 60 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 115 people. That decline was greater in our part-time labor. As a result, the full-time equivalent headcount was actually still up 1.4% in the quarter. And that reflects both the Fasteners Inc. acquisition as well as the additions we made to vending and Onsites. 
Sequentially, total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 460 people. The full-time equivalent was down 4.8% and that just relates to what's become prudent headcount management, given the sluggish demand environment and our efforts to prune some of our stores. We did see an increase in health care expenses in this quarter. However, overall, the employee-related expense as a percentage of sales, we thought, were stable year-over-year and frankly, improved slightly sequentially.
Occupancy, expenses there were up both on an annual and sequential basis. This relates to 3 things: first and most significantly is the continued growth in our vending equipment. Revenues through our vending machines were still up almost 10% in the third quarter. That's well above our corporate growth, so we feel good about these investments. 
Secondly, we continue to invest in our distribution infrastructure, primarily related to automation initiatives we've had underway. We think that, that will contribute to long-term productivity. And then third, in the third quarter, the expense was also lifted due to the closing of those 65 stores. For those reasons in the short term and given the current environment, occupancy expenses are certainly playing a material role in pushing down our near-term margin.
Cash flow generation. We generated $133 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's down about 5% versus last year, really related just to lower income this period, but it does represent 105% of this quarter's net income, which is actually slightly better than last year. We did have a free cash deficit of about $27 million. That includes our having paid our dividend. But we also saw capital spending rise, and that's simply a function of the leased locker program with Walmart and sort of the costs related to that. We didn't buy back any shares in the period, and we did add about $15 million in debt to finance the free cash shortfall.
Lastly, on balance sheet, our total debt at the end of the third quarter is now about $445 million. That is up $130 million from the end of third quarter last year. On a net cash basis, our total debt now is 13.5% of total capital, up marginally from 10.2% in the same period a year ago. That rise is modest, and it relates to the modest free cash generation we've had from lower earnings; the higher inventories we put out there due to CSP 16; some stock repurchase; and of course, the payment of our dividend. 
We do view the balance sheet as being conservative to capitalize, and we have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business and pay our dividend. In terms of working capital, this will be my last comment, we were comfortable with how the numbers shook out. The receivables came in at about 49.7 days. That is comparable to where it was a year ago. Inventories came in at 159.6 [ph] That's well ahead of where we were a year ago but that was expected. It does reflect our infusing the CSP 16 products into the field; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc., which will anniversary November; and the increase in Onsite locations. 
But the annual increase in dollar inventories was 9.5%. That was -- that did achieve our goal of keeping growth below 10%. So overall, we're comfortable with where the condition of our balance sheet is, given the effect of the significant growth investments that have impacted it. That's all I have, and with that, I'll -- we'll turn it over to questions."

Right now, our operating expenses are up about 5% year-over-year. Some of that because the investments we've made. We need to structurally lower that, probably closer to 3.5% to 4% so that at 3.5% and [ph] 4% revenue growth, we can let that shine through. Obviously, one thing that's inherent in our numbers right now is of the accordions that are within the -- if you think of the cost structure of Fastenal, our incentive comp is at an incredibly low point right now. So we'd be very mindful of the structural expenses we're adding as we look into 2017 and '18, because we know there will be some expansion in that cost pool as we go to '17 and '18 and that's frankly a good thing. That was also -- I'm not going to point -- paint the picture of the DLL rule changes. We're the only reason we closed some stores. They're the reason we moved pretty quickly, but we do need to be mindful some structural costs that we can remove from the business, especially in a environment where Onsites are a bigger part of our growth driver going forward."

If you look at the CSP from a gross margin perspective, the stuff we were saying earlier wasn't about CSP 16 so much.

And we were aggressively moving on some inventory from a clearance standpoint. The CSP 16, those -- the margins on those products are nicely above the company average. That has much to do about the mix of who that business is going to as it is about the actual product. Because in the CSP 16, there's a fairly strong mixture of tool categories, et cetera, that don't necessarily have higher gross margin. But the mix of customers is beneficial in that business. So that CSP 16 has a positive influence overall to gross margin, albeit a relatively small impact on the relative dollars. And in terms of the freight, I mean, our gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially from Q2 to Q3. I think it's fair to suggest that freight was a significant piece of that 20 basis points, if not all of it."

And so maybe you could talk about how much of your revenue base you already have free freight with certain customers. And then maybe talk a little bit more about the pushback with execution issues that you're seeing there."

One is if you think of our growth drivers both short term and multiyear, our growth drivers lend themselves towards things of that really don't have a freight component to them. Vending, there really isn't a freight component to vending, so that business, that growth, that $600 million-plus business a year is freight free because it's part of the offering we have. If you think of CSP 16 by placing it in the store, those products don't really lend themselves to having freight charged on them, whereas perhaps in the past some of that revenue again, that's a relatively small impact. One of the selling impacts or selling philosophies of the Onsite is that by moving in Onsite there are certain costs we can strip out. One of them is some of your working capital costs because we can stock that inventory because we're a more efficient supply chain. Some of that is because we're more orderly in what we're ordering in our visibility to when we see -- we learn about transactions before they become quotes and purchase orders. And so we can be more efficient and how we manage our freight costs. So those are structural changes over time that aren't necessarily detrimental in the true sense of the word. I think one of the things that can happen when you're going through this environment of some of the structural changes don't necessarily have a freight component to them is that you can convince yourself that maybe the other pieces don't have as great propensity to have freight as they did in the past. Maybe that piece of that is the tone of the leaders of the organization and I look at myself when I say that. Maybe I'm not pushing it hard enough. But it's the case of you can convince yourself on why you can't do some stuff, and you need to convince herself on why you can, why you should. And I think that's probably the bigger culprit in this equation then the marketplace because the marketplace doesn't change that abruptly to explain some of the degradation we had."

And I asked our team to take a look at this group of vending machines, and it's a sizable group of vending machines so population if you look at, and you can actually glean some knowledge from it. We took a good hard look at it and what we saw -- because one thing -- one visibility we have into our customers' business that we've never had before is the insight into how many unique people are using the device. If there's 100 employees that are in this customer's facility, you know that because those 100 people are in the database are people that can use the vending platform, and it also -- of those 100 people can these customers is the us but is if I'm in the welding area, I have access to the welding tips but if I'm not in the welding area, I don't have access to those 6 buttons, if you will. And -- or those 6 products. And one thing that jumped out for us where we had vending machines were negative and again, it was a sizable number is the number of employees on the database right now versus a year ago had dropped. And that group, the number if employees had dropped about 10%. And I don't recall offhand how many customer locations this included but that tells me we have a bunch of customers and our fastener business was negative with those customers. We have a bunch of customers who had downsized some operations, maybe they have fewer shifts maybe they have fewer people per shift, but they have downsized in this group of about 10% actual headcount. And we were seeing in those machines revenue down in the teens. So that's the case of serious belt-tightening going on that there was just a drop in consumption because there was a drop in the workload at that business. And that's -- the economics are such that if there's fewer employees from a year ago, they need fewer safety glasses and gloves and consumables that go with having people."

Holden's been here now for, I believe, 5.5 -- about 5.5 weeks, so he's a seasoned veteran at the Fastenal organization. When we started 2016, had a handful of expectations for the year, and I thought I'd run through those expectations and talk a little bit how the year's played out relative to those expectations. First expectation for the year, we're going to open some stores. We hadn't opened much stores in recent years. We're going to open a few more stores, and not a lot, but a few more because that is part of our long-term growth, and it's about always exploring ways to grow in different markets. 
The second thing we were going to do is we're going to reinvigorate our store network. We talked about CSP 16 at our Investor Day last November. Essentially, we injected about $75 million of inventory in our store network to be a better supplier, a more efficient supplier and a better same-day supplier, and we're pretty good already, but let's get better.
Third item, let's reinvigorate our vending. We've created a wonderful vending business in the last 5 years, but in the last 2 years, we've lost some steam. In 2014 and 2015, we had -- we were signing about 4,000 a quarter, so we were -- had run rates of about 16,000 a year, and really saw  there's a lot more potential there and our capabilities are strong and this naturally works with our store and on-site network. Let's go after this more aggressively. The fourth, speaking of our on-site network, let's transition to an on-site mentality for growth. History says we will sign about 5 to 10 a year. In 2015, we had started a transition. We signed about 80. Could we sign 200 in 2016? 5, our comps are going to ease in...

Our comps, we're going to ease a bit in Q3, with a lull for mid-single-digit growth in sales, and gives us a little more flexibility on what we could afford to spend as we approach the year. Let's focus on our growth drivers in 2016. Let's demonstrate to ourselves and others that we can grow in this environment, and let our regional vice presidents, our district manager group, our hub manager group, our support leads run their businesses. It's an incredibly talented group. They run an incredibly impressive business. Let them run it. Let's focus on our growth drivers. And point 7, 8, 9 and 10, serve your customers, serve them everyday, improve their business and ours and be creative. We will grow. What are some of the realities of the year? We are opening some stores. We'll open about 30 -- we'll have opened between 35 and 40 stores for the year. I think that's a good number for us in 2016. 
One item that changed on our stores is in May of 2016, the Department of Labor published some new rules regarding exempt employees. This rule, while it doesn't impact our company in totality because it essentially raised the threshold of what qualifies as an exempt employee from -- there's rules for duties that qualify you, and there's also a rule for pay, and those rules were increased dramatically in 2016.  Because of that change, it does impact our smaller stores because in our smaller stores, we don't always compensate above that $48,000 level because we have folks that are building a business, and we're a sales-minded organization, but the opportunity is huge. But as you all know from the years of us publishing our pathway to profit data, stores under the $75,000 amount are not profitable -- are marginally profitable, and this damages that, and we decided to close some stores. 
We moved fairly aggressively on it. We closed 65 stores in Q3. We have another 32 stores queued up to close in Q4, and we're also evaluating another group we're going to look at in 2017. But because of the close to 100 stores that we identified for closure, we did book up a reserve in the third quarter for those closures primarily related to the occupancy, but we moved fairly quickly on it. 
These closures should have a minimum impact on our revenue similar to closures in the past because the stores have another -- these locations have another store and recently close proximity. And as you know from previous conversations, the vast majority of our revenue is business-to-business, most of it going out our back door. We're delivering to the customer site. So for serving a market with 5 stores versus 4 stores or 3 stores versus 4 stores doesn't necessarily change our ability to grow or ability to maintain the business we have, and typically, we maintain 90-plus percent of the business when we close a store. 
But it did change a bit of our thought process, as we've gone through the year just because of the changing landscape, the reality we live in. CSP 16, we moved aggressively on that early in the year. Our store conversion is largely behind us. We believe this broadens our ability to, as I mentioned earlier, be a better same-day supplier, appeal to a broader range of customers. We believe that, ultimately, this will help us as we go in 2017 with our construction customer, but we believe it makes us a more efficient business. 
On vending, our run rate has improved, and we've been signing 4,700 to 4,800 per quarter instead of the closer to 4,000 we were doing in the last 2 years. Right now, our run rate, if you just take that number and annualize it, it's about a 19,000 run rate versus the 16,000 the last couple of years. This is okay. It's not great. We added 200-and-some people earlier in the year to ramp this number up. That ramp has been moving a little bit slower than I would have liked. I'd like the quarterly number to start with a 5 versus a 4, but we've improved it nicely. 
And I also have to acknowledge the fact that, as you all know from previous calls, we signed a rather sizable vending leasing program earlier in the first half of the year, and we've deployed in the last 4 months roughly 11,000 vending machines into that program, and that's created a little bit of distraction to our program, but I'd still like a number that starts with a 5, but we've made nice progress. 
Regarding the transition to Onsite, I'm frankly impressed with our team. We still have work to do, but I'm impressed with the fact that we've signed 133 year-to-date. That put us on pace to do roughly 180. Our record year last year was 80. I believe we're creating momentum for our business into the future, because the closer we get to the customer, whether that be with our store network, our vending platform or our Onsite, history has demonstrated we take market share when we do that because we have a servant's heart within our organization. Our covenant with our customer, we will help you be a better business by being a great supplier, a great partner to you, and the Onsite strategy only makes that better. And I'm very pleased with the transition we're making, and that I expect us to continue making as we enter 2017.
Point 5, the comps were easing in the third quarter, and that will help us. Unfortunately, we're still stuck in that band of 1 to 3. If you look at it from Q2 to Q3, our sales are treading water, but there's 2 stories going on in there. Our fastener business continues to be weak. That business has been weak since the spring of 2015, and our fastener revenue dropped about $10 million from Q2 to Q3. 
Under the hood, our fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. Under the hood, our non-fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. We didn't execute that -- we haven't been executing that well, in my opinion, in 2016 in general on our freight. Our potential [ph] to charge freight has weakened in the last 6, 7 quarters. Lower fuel prices, and it's part of the reason, discipline is the other, perhaps, the marketplace is making it a little bit more challenging to charge freight. But there's still ample examples where we can charge it. We're not -- and we need to be better at executing on that front. But the product margins under the hood, again, we have mix going against us because the fastener business was down about $10 million. We continue to see us inching along and improving the relative gross margin on the components.
If sales are up 5% and -- 5%, 6%, as we were expecting, the fact that our expenses are up a little bit above 5%, would be okay, wouldn't be great, but it'd be okay. Unfortunately, that's not the fact pattern, and we're pulling some levers on expenses. One of those levers that we're pulling is to help offset some of the DOL impacts as we go into 2017 to offset some of the investment impacts we made in 2016. 
The regulatory environment, well, you all watch the news. I'm not sharing a secret here. It's not a great environment to do business in, and -- but that's the world we live in, and that's the world we need to contend with. And there's a lot of uncertainty, but the certainty I do know is that we have a great organization, a great group of people out there managing our business. And we're going to continue to focus on our growth drivers, and we're going to continue to let our regional vice presidents, our district managers, our hub managers, our support leads run their respective groups. 
But we'll need to be mindful of the environment we're in. It's a different earnings call for me this quarter, and as the last couple of quarters had been, in that I don't have a bunch of spreadsheets sitting in front of me, ready to answer any and every question, just talking about the business, and I'm upbeat about our business as I look forward. There's a lot of good things from a momentum standpoint, but it was a tough quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

In terms of the revenues, total and daily sales in the third quarter were both up 1.8%. That's the third straight quarter where we've seen daily sales growth between that 1.5% and 2% range. 
We did like that the quarter finished in September with a daily sales rate up 2.8%. But as you all know, the comparison did get quite a bit easier, and that's a pattern that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. Qualitatively, it's not clear to us that the tone changed much in the third quarter. We saw that the sales of fasteners into heavy manufacturing construction end markets were relatively weak, as we've seen before. The same could be said of our largest customers. Our top 100 was flat to maybe down slightly during the period, but again, these are the same dynamics that have persisted throughout 2016. If there was any incremental change, it may have been that the U.S. business grew a little less quickly while Canada and Mexico actually strengthened. But at the end of the day, it all blended in what we thought was a fairly consistent quarterly sales performance. 
This sluggishness does mask the progress we're making on our growth drivers. Dan alluded to some of this, but we did sign over 4,700 vending machines in the third quarter. Our total installed base rose by more than 2,000 units. We now have 60,000 -- more than 60,000 in the field. That's a figure that does not include the machines that are related to our lease locker program, which is being rolled out as we expected it to be. 
We also signed 41 Onsites in the third quarter. We're up to about 133 year-to-date. The SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative are growing faster than the company as a whole, and we'll provide some additional insights into the CSP 16 and Onsite initiatives after the fourth quarter. But again, overall, we think that those initiatives are proceeding nicely.
In terms of gross profit, our gross margin was 49.3% in the third quarter. That's down 120 basis points annually and that's down 20 basis points versus last quarter. We discussed the gross margin ramifications related to the relative growth of our non-fastener large customer mix in the short intermediate term, and that dynamic was significant in the annual decline we saw this quarter. In particular, fasteners, as you saw as a percentage of sales, that's down 180 basis points year-over-year to 36.1%. That does have an impact on our gross margin overall.
That was also a factor in our modest sequential decline. But that said, we were a bit disappointed that the gross margin slipped in the third quarter. We looked at the gross margin of the fastener and non-fastener categories. They remain stable. We did good work there. We don't believe that we saw any meaningful pressure within the product categories themselves. We did see higher freight costs this quarter. That relates to both the weak demand, also, perhaps, our own diligence around inventory levels during the quarter. But regardless, the freight was a significant contributor to the downward drift we saw in the sequential gross margin, Q2 to Q3 of '16. 
In terms of operating expenses, our operating margin was 20% in the quarter. That's down 210 basis points annually, and down 60 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 115 people. That decline was greater in our part-time labor. As a result, the full-time equivalent headcount was actually still up 1.4% in the quarter, and that reflects both the Fasteners Inc. acquisition, as well as the additions we made to vending and Onsites. Sequentially, total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 460 people. The full-time equivalent was down 4.8%, and that just relates to what's become prudent headcount management, given the sluggish demand environment and our efforts to prune some of our stores. We did see an increase in health care expenses in this quarter. However, overall, the employee-related expense as a percentage of sales, we thought, were stable year-over-year, and frankly, improved slightly sequentially.
Occupancy, expenses there were up both on an annual and sequential basis. This relates to 3 things: first and most significantly is the continued growth in our vending equipment. Revenues through our vending machines were still up almost 10% in the third quarter. That's well above our corporate growth, so we feel good about these investments. Secondly, we continue to invest in our distribution infrastructure, primarily related to automation initiatives we've had underway. We think that, that will contribute to long-term productivity. And then third, in the third quarter, the expense was also lifted due to the closing of those 65 stores. For those reasons in the short term and given the current environment, occupancy expenses are certainly playing a material role in pushing down our near-term margin.
Cash flow generation. We generated $133 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's down about 5% versus last year, really related just to lower income this period, but it does represent 105% of this quarter's net income, which is actually slightly better than last year. We did have a free cash deficit of about $27 million. That includes our having paid our dividend. But we also saw capital spending rise, and that's simply a function of the lease locker program with Walmart and sort of the cost related to that. We didn't buy back any shares in the period, and we did add about $15 million in debt to finance the free cash shortfall.
Lastly, on balance sheet, our total debt at the end of the third quarter is now about $445 million. That is up $130 million from the end of third quarter last year. On a net cash basis, our total debt now is 13.5% of total capital, up marginally from 10.2% in the same period a year ago. That rise is modest, and it relates to the modest free cash generation we've had from lower earnings; the higher inventories we put out there due to CSP 16; some stock repurchase; and of course, the payment of our dividend. 
We do view the balance sheet as being conservatively capitalized, and we have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business and pay our dividend. In terms of working capital, this will be my last comment, we were comfortable with how the numbers shook out. The receivables came in at about 49.7 days. That is comparable to where it was a year ago. Inventories came in at 159.6. That's well ahead of where we were a year ago, but that was expected. It does reflect our infusing the CSP 16 products into the field; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc., which will anniversary in November; and the increase in Onsite locations. 
But the annual increase in dollar inventories was 9.5%. That was -- that did achieve our goal of keeping growth below 10%. So overall, we're comfortable with where the condition of our balance sheet is, given the effect of the significant growth investments that have impacted it. That's all I have, and with that, I'll -- we'll turn it over to questions."

And there's a better shine-through of the revenue growth or maybe I could just answer to the context of gross profit dollar growth we need. Right now, our operating expenses are up about 5% year-over-year, some of that because the investments we've made. We need to structurally lower that, probably closer to 3.5% to 4%, so that at 3.5% and 4% revenue growth, we can let that shine through. Obviously, one thing that's inherent in our numbers right now is of the accordions that are within the -- if you think of the cost structure of Fastenal, our incentive comp is at an incredibly low point right now. So we'd be very mindful of the structural expenses we're adding as we look into 2017 and '18 because we know there will be some expansion in that cost pool as we go into '17 and '18 and that's frankly a good thing. That was also -- I'm not going to point -- paint the picture of the DOL rule changes were the only reason we closed some stores. They were the reason we moved pretty quickly, but we do need to be mindful of some structural costs that we can remove from the business, especially in a environment where Onsites are a bigger part of our growth driver going forward."

And so maybe you could talk about how much of your revenue base you already have free freight with certain customers, and then maybe talk a little bit more about the pushback with execution issues that you're seeing there."

One is if you think of our growth drivers, both short term and multiyear, our growth drivers are -- lend themselves towards things that really don't have a freight component to them. Vending, there really isn't a freight component to vending. So that business, that growth, that $600 million-plus business a year is freight-free because it's part of the offering we have. If you think of CSP 16 by placing it in the store, those products don't really lend themselves to having freight charged on them, whereas perhaps in the past [indiscernible] freight on some of that revenue again. That's a relatively small impact. One of the selling impacts or selling philosophies of the Onsite is that by moving in Onsite facilities, there are certain costs we can strip out. One of them is some of your working capital costs because we can stock that inventory because we're a more efficient supply chain. Some of that is because we're more orderly in what we're ordering in our visibility to when we see the -- we learn about transactions before they become quotes and purchase orders, and so we can be more efficient on how we manage our freight costs. So those are structural changes over time that aren't necessarily detrimental in the true sense of the word. I think one of the things that can happen when you're going through this environment of some of the structural changes don't necessarily have a freight component to them is that you can convince yourself that maybe the other pieces don't have as great propensity to have freight on them as they did in the past. Maybe that piece of that is the tone of the leaders of the organization, and I look at myself when I say that. Maybe I'm not pushing it hard enough. But it's the case of sometimes you can convince yourself on why you can't do some stuff, and you need to convince yourself on why you can, why you should. And I think that's probably the bigger culprit in this equation than the marketplace. Because the marketplace doesn't change that abruptly to explain some of the degradation we had."

I -- we had a -- quite a few vending machines that have been running negative, vending relationships that have been running negative. And I asked our team to take a look at this group of vending machines, and it's a sizable group of vending machines. So it was the population you'd look at, and you could actually glean some knowledge from it. We took a good hard look at it, and what we saw -- because one thing -- one visibility we have into our customers' business that we've never had before is the insight into how many unique people are using the device. We -- if there's 100 employees that are in this customer's facility, you know that because those 100 people are in the database of people that can use the vending platform, and it also -- of those 100 people can get these customers versus those products. If I'm in the welding area, I have access to the welding tips. But if I'm not in the welding area, I don't have access to those 6 buttons, if you will. And -- or those 6 products. And one thing that jumped out for us where we had vending machines that were negative, and again, it was a sizable number, is the number of employees on the database right now versus a year ago had dropped. And that group, the number of employees had dropped about 10%. And I don't recall offhand how many customer locations this included. But that tells me we have a bunch of customers, and our fastener business was negative with those customers. We have a bunch of customers who had downsized some operations. Maybe they have fewer shifts. Maybe they have fewer people per shift. But they had downsized in this group about 10% actual headcount, and we were seeing in those machines revenue down in the teens. So that's the case. So there were some serious belt-tightening going on. But there was just a drop in consumption because there was a drop in the workload at that business. And that's -- the economics are such that if there's fewer employees from a year ago, they need fewer safety glasses and gloves and the consumables that go with having people."

Holden's been here now for, I believe, 5.5 -- about 5.5 weeks, so he's a seasoned veteran at the Fastenal organization. When we started 2016, had a handful of expectations for the year, and I thought I'd run through those expectations and talk a little bit how the year's played out relative to those expectations. First expectation for the year: we're going to open some stores. We hadn't opened much stores in recent years. We're going to open a few more stores, and not a lot, but a few more because that is part of our long-term growth, and it's about always exploring ways to grow in different markets. 
The second thing we were going to do is we're going to reinvigorate our store network. We talked about CSP 16 at our Investor Day last November. Essentially, we injected about $75 million of inventory in our store network to be a better supplier, a more efficient supplier and a better same-day supplier, and we're pretty good already, but let's get better.
Third item, let's reinvigorate our vending. We've created a wonderful vending business in the last 5 years, but in the last 2 years, we've lost some steam. In 2014 and 2015, we had -- we were signing about 4,000 a quarter, so we were -- had run rates of about 16,000 a year, and really saw there's a lot more potential there. And our capabilities are strong and this naturally works with our store and Onsite network. Let's go after this more aggressively. The fourth, speaking of our Onsite network, let's transition to an on-site mentality for growth. History says we will sign about 5 to 10 a year. In 2015, we had started a transition. We signed about 80. Could we sign 200 in 2016? Five: our comps are going to ease in Q3...

L",1433,"Sorry about that, folks. I'm not sure where that came from. Our comps were going to ease a bit in Q3, would allow for from mid-single-digit growth in sales, and gives us a little more flexibility on what we could afford to spend as we approach the year. Let's focus on our growth drivers in 2016. Let's demonstrate to ourselves and others that we can grow in this environment, and let our regional vice presidents, our district manager group, our hub manager group, our support leads run their businesses. It's an incredibly talented group. They run an incredibly impressive business. Let them run it. Let's focus on our growth drivers. And points 7, 8, 9 and 10, serve your customers, serve them every day, improve their business and ours and be creative. We will grow. What are some of the realities of the year? We are opening some stores. We'll open about 30 -- we'll have opened between 35 and 40 stores for the year. I think that's a good number for us in 2016. 
One item that changed on our stores is in May of 2016, the Department of Labor published some new rules regarding exempt employees. This rule, while it doesn't impact our company in totality because it essentially raised the threshold of what qualifies as an exempt employee from -- there's rules for duties that qualify you, and there's also a rule for pay, and those rules were increased dramatically in 2016.  Because of that change, it does impact our smaller stores because in our smaller stores, we don't always compensate above that $48,000 level because we have folks that are building a business, and we're a sales-minded organization, but the opportunity is huge. But as you all know from the years of us publishing our pathway to profit data, stores under the $75,000 amount are not profitable -- are marginally profitable, and this damages that, and we decided to close some stores. 
We moved fairly aggressively on it. We closed 65 stores in Q3. We have another 32 stores queued up to close in Q4, and we're also evaluating another group we're going to look at in 2017. But because of the close-to-100 stores that we identified for closure, we did book up a reserve in the third quarter for those closures primarily related to the occupancy, but we moved fairly quickly on it. 
These closures should have a minimum impact on our revenue, similar to closures in the past because the stores have another -- these locations have another store in reasonably close proximity. And as you know from previous conversations, the vast majority of our revenue is business-to-business, most of it going out our back door, and we're delivering to the customer's site. So for serving a market with 5 stores versus 4 stores or 3 stores versus 4 stores doesn't necessarily change our ability to grow or our ability to maintain the business we have. And typically, we maintain 90-plus percent of the business when we close a store. 
But it did change a bit of our thought process, as we've gone through the year just because of the changing landscape, the reality we live in. CSP 16, we moved aggressively on that early in the year. Our store conversion is largely behind us. We believe this broadens our ability to, as I mentioned earlier, be a better same-day supplier, appeal to a broader range of customers. We believe that, ultimately, this will help us as we go in 2017 with our construction customer, but we believe it makes us a more efficient business. 
On vending, our run rate has improved, and we've been signing 4,700 to 4,800 per quarter instead of the closer to 4,000 we were doing in the last 2 years. Right now, our run rate, if you just take that number and annualize it, it's about a 19,000 run rate versus the 16,000 of the last couple of years. This is okay. It's not great. We added 200-and-some people earlier in the year to ramp this number up. That ramp has been moving a little bit slower than I would have liked. I'd like the quarterly number to start with a 5 versus a 4, but we've improved it nicely. 
And I also have to acknowledge the fact that, as you all know from previous calls, we signed a rather sizable vending leasing program earlier in the first half of the year, and we've deployed in the last 4 months roughly 11,000 vending machines into that program. And that's created a little bit of distraction to our program, but I'd still like a number that starts with a 5, but we've made nice progress. 
Regarding the transition to Onsite, I'm frankly impressed with our team. We still have work to do, but I'm impressed with the fact that we've signed 133 year-to-date. That put us on pace to do roughly 180. Our record year last year was 80. I believe we're creating momentum for our business into the future, because the closer we get to the customer, whether that be with our store network, our vending platform or our Onsite, history has demonstrated we take market share when we do that, because we have a servant's heart within our organization. Our covenant with our customer: we will help you be a better business by being a great supplier, a great partner to you. And the Onsite strategy only makes that better. And I'm very pleased with the transition we're making and that I expect us to continue making as we enter 2017.
Point 5, the comps were easing in the third quarter, and that will help us. Unfortunately, we're still stuck in that band of 1 to 3. If you look at it from Q2 to Q3, our sales are treading water, but there's 2 stories going on in there. Our fastener business continues to be weak. That business has been weak since the spring of 2015, and our fastener revenue dropped about $10 million from Q2 to Q3. 
Under the hood, our fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. Under the hood, our non-fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. We didn't execute that -- we haven't been executing that well, in my opinion, in 2016 in general on our freight. Our potential [ph] to charge freight has weakened in the last 6, 7 quarters. Lower fuel prices is part of the reason, discipline is the other, perhaps the marketplace is making it a little bit more challenging to charge freight. But there's still ample examples where we can charge it, and we're not. And we need to be better at executing on that front. But the product margins under the hood, again, we have mix going against us because the fastener business was down about $10 million. We continue to see us inching along and improving the relative gross margin on the components.
If sales are up 5% and -- 5%, 6%, as we were expecting, the fact that our expenses are up a little bit above 5% would be okay, wouldn't be great, but it'd be okay. Unfortunately, that's not the fact pattern, and we're pulling some levers on expenses. One of those levers that we're pulling is to help offset some of the DOL impacts as we go into 2017 to offset some of the investment impacts we made in 2016. 
The regulatory environment, well, you all watch the news. I'm not sharing a secret here. It's not a great environment to do business in, and -- but that's the world we live in, and that's the world we need to contend with. And there's a lot of uncertainty, but the certainty I do know is that we have a great organization, a great group of people out there managing our business. And we're going to continue to focus on our growth drivers, and we're going to continue to let our regional vice presidents, our district managers, our hub managers, our support leads run their respective groups. 
But we'll need to be mindful of the environment we're in. It's a different earnings call for me this quarter, and as the last couple of quarters have been, in that I don't have a bunch of spreadsheets sitting in front of me, ready to answer any and every question. Just talking about the business and I'm upbeat about our business as I look forward. There's a lot of good things from a momentum standpoint, but it was a tough quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

In terms of the revenues, total and daily sales in the third quarter were both up 1.8%. That's the third straight quarter where we've seen daily sales growth between that 1.5% and 2% range. 
We did like that the quarter finished in September with a daily sales rate up 2.8%. But as you all know, the comparison did get quite a bit easier, and that's a pattern that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. Qualitatively, it's not clear to us that the tone changed much in the third quarter. We saw that the sales of fasteners into heavy manufacturing and construction end markets were relatively weak, as we've seen before. The same could be said of our largest customers. Our top 100 was flat to maybe down slightly during the period, but again, these are the same dynamics that have persisted throughout 2016. If there was any incremental change, it may have been that the U.S. business grew a little less quickly while Canada and Mexico actually strengthened. But at the end of the day, it all blended into what we thought was a fairly consistent quarterly sales performance. 
This sluggishness does mask the progress we're making on our growth drivers. Dan alluded to some of this, but we did sign over 4,700 vending machines in the third quarter. Our total installed base rose by more than 2,000 units. We now have 60,000 -- more than 60,000 in the field. That's a figure that does not include the machines that are related to our leased locker program, which is being rolled out as we expected it to be. 
We also signed 41 Onsites in the third quarter. We're up to about 133 year-to-date. The SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative are growing faster than the company as a whole, and we'll provide some additional insights into the CSP 16 and Onsite initiatives after the fourth quarter. But again, overall, we think that those initiatives are proceeding nicely.
In terms of gross profit, our gross margin was 49.3% in the third quarter. That's down 120 basis points annually and that's down 20 basis points versus last quarter. We discussed the gross margin ramifications related to the relative growth of our non-fastener large customer mix in the short and intermediate term, and that dynamic was significant in the annual decline we saw this quarter. In particular fasteners, as you saw as a percentage of sales, that's down 180 basis points year-over-year to 36.1%. That does have an impact on our gross margin overall.
That was also a factor in our modest sequential decline. But that said, we were a bit disappointed that the gross margin slipped in the third quarter. We looked at the gross margin of the fastener and non-fastener categories. They remained stable. We did good work there. We don't believe that we saw any meaningful pressure within the product categories themselves. We did see higher freight costs this quarter. That relates to both the weak demand, also, perhaps, our own diligence around inventory levels during the quarter. But regardless, the freight was a significant contributor to the downward drift we saw in the sequential gross margin, Q2 to Q3 of '16. 
In terms of operating expenses, our operating margin was 20% in the quarter. That's down 210 basis points annually and down 60 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 115 people. That decline was greater in our part-time labor. As a result, the full-time equivalent headcount was actually still up 1.4% in the quarter, and that reflects both the Fasteners Inc. acquisition, as well as the additions we made to vending and Onsites. Sequentially, total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 460 people. The full-time equivalent was down 4.8%, and that just relates to what's become prudent headcount management, given the sluggish demand environment and our efforts to prune some of our stores. We did see an increase in health care expenses in this quarter. However, overall, the employee-related expense as a percentage of sales, we thought, were stable year-over-year, and frankly, improved slightly sequentially.
Occupancy, expenses there were up both on an annual and sequential basis. This relates to 3 things: first and most significantly is the continued growth in our vending equipment. Revenues through our vending machines were still up almost 10% in the third quarter. That's well above our corporate growth, so we feel good about these investments. Secondly, we continue to invest in our distribution infrastructure, primarily related to automation initiatives we've had underway. We think that, that will contribute to long-term productivity. And then third, in the third quarter, the expense was also lifted due to the closing of those 65 stores. For those reasons in the short term and given the current environment, occupancy expenses are certainly playing a material role in pushing down our near-term margin.
Cash flow generation. We generated $133 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's down about 5% versus last year, really related just to the lower income this period, but it does represent 105% of this quarter's net income, which is actually slightly better than last year. We did have a free cash deficit of about $27 million. That includes our having paid our dividend. But we also saw capital spending rise, and that's simply a function of the leased locker program with Walmart and sort of the costs related to that. We didn't buy back any shares in the period, and we did add about $15 million in debt to finance the free cash shortfall.
Lastly, on balance sheet, our total debt at the end of the third quarter is now about $445 million. That is up $130 million from the end of third quarter last year. On a net cash basis, our total debt now is 13.5% of total capital, up marginally from 10.2% in the same period a year ago. That rise is modest, and it relates to the modest free cash generation we've had from lower earnings; the higher inventories we put out there due to CSP 16; some stock repurchase; and of course, the payment of our dividend. 
We do view the balance sheet as being conservatively capitalized, and we have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business and pay our dividend. In terms of working capital, this will be my last comment, we were comfortable with how the numbers shook out. The receivables came in at about 49.7 days. That is comparable to where it was year ago. Inventories came in at 159.6. That's well ahead of where we were a year ago, but that was expected. It does reflect our infusing the CSP 16 products into the field; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc., which will anniversary in November; and the increase in Onsite locations. 
But the annual increase in dollar inventories was 9.5%. That was -- that did achieve our goal of keeping growth below 10%. So overall, we're comfortable with where the condition of our balance sheet is, given the effect of the significant growth investments that have impacted it. That's all I have, and with that, I'll -- we'll turn it over to questions."

Right now, our operating expenses are up about 5% year-over-year, some of that because of the investments we've made. We need to structurally lower that, probably closer to 3.5% to 4%, so that at 3.5% or 4% revenue growth we can let that shine through. Obviously, one thing that's inherent in our numbers right now is of the accordions that are within the -- if you think of the cost structure of Fastenal, our incentive comp is at an incredibly low point right now. So we have to be very mindful of the structural expenses we're adding as we look into 2017 and '18 because we know there will be some expansion in that cost pool as we go into '17 and '18 and that's, frankly, a good thing. That was also -- I'm not going to point -- paint the picture of the DOL rule changes were the only reason we closed some stores. They were a reason we moved pretty quickly.

One is if you think of our growth drivers, both short term and multiyear, our growth drivers are -- lend themselves towards things that really don't have a freight component to them. Vending, there really isn't a freight component to vending. So that business, that growth, that $600 million-plus business a year is freight-free because it's part of the offering we have. If you think of CSP 16 by placing it in the store, those products don't really lend themselves to having freight charged on them, whereas perhaps in the past there would have been freight on some of that revenue. Again, that's a relatively small impact. One of the selling impacts or selling philosophies of the Onsite is that by moving in Onsite facilities, there are certain costs we can strip out. One of them is some of your working capital costs because we can stock that inventory because we're a more efficient supply chain. Some of that is because we're more orderly in what we're ordering and our visibility to when we see the -- we learn about transactions before they become quotes and purchase orders, and so we can be more efficient on how we manage our freight costs. So those are structural changes over time that aren't necessarily detrimental in the true sense of the word. I think one of the things that can happen when you're going through this environment of some of the structural changes don't necessarily have a freight component to them is that you can convince yourself that maybe the other pieces don't have as great a propensity to have freight on them as they did in the past. Maybe that piece of that is the tone of the leaders of the organization, and I look at myself when I say that. Maybe I'm not pushing it hard enough. But it's the case of sometimes you can convince yourself on why you can't do some stuff, and you need to convince yourself on why you can, why you should. And I think that's probably the bigger culprit in this equation than the marketplace. Because the marketplace doesn't change that abruptly to explain some of the degradation we had."

I -- we had quite a few vending machines that have been running negative and vending relationships that have been running negative. And I asked our team to take a look at this group of vending machines, and it's a sizable group of vending machines. So it was the population you'd look at, and you could actually glean some knowledge from it. We took a good hard look at it, and what we saw -- because one thing -- one visibility we have into our customers' business that we've never had before is the insight into how many unique people are using the device. We -- if there's 100 employees that are in this customer's facility, you know that because those 100 people are in the database of people that can use the vending platform, and it also -- what of those 100 people can get these products versus those products. If I'm in the welding area, I have access to the welding tips. But if I'm not in the welding area, I don't have access to those 6 buttons, if you will. And -- or those 6 products. And one thing that jumped out for us where we had vending machines that were negative, and again, it was a sizable number, is the number of employees in the database right now versus a year ago had dropped. In that group, the number of employees had dropped about 10%. And I don't recall offhand how many customer locations this included. But that tells me we have a bunch of customers -- and our fastener business was negative at those customers. We have a bunch of customers who had downsized some operations. Maybe they have fewer shifts. Maybe they have fewer people per shift. But they had downsized in this group about 10% actual headcount, and we were seeing in those machines revenue down in the teens. So that's a case of there was some serious belt-tightening going on. But there was just a drop in consumption because there was a drop in the workload at that business. And that's -- the economics are such that if there's fewer employees from a year ago, they need fewer safety glasses and gloves and the consumables that go with having people."

Holden's been here now for, I believe, 5.5 -- about 5.5 weeks, so he's a seasoned veteran at the Fastenal organization. When we started 2016, had a handful of expectations for the year, and I thought I'd run through those expectations and talk a little bit how the year's played out relative to those expectations. First expectation for the year: we're going to open some stores. We hadn't opened much stores in recent years. We're going to open a few more stores, and not a lot, but a few more because that is part of our long-term growth, and it's about always exploring ways to grow in different markets. 
The second thing we were going to do is we're going to reinvigorate our store network. We talked about CSP 16 at our Investor Day last November. Essentially, we injected about $75 million of inventory in our store network to be a better supplier, a more efficient supplier and a better same-day supplier, and we're pretty good already, but let's get better.
Third item, let's reinvigorate our vending. We've created a wonderful vending business in the last 5 years, but in the last 2 years, we've lost some steam. In 2014 and 2015, we had -- we were signing about 4,000 a quarter, so we were -- had run rates of about 16,000 a year, and really saw there's a lot more potential there. And our capabilities are strong and this naturally works with our store and Onsite network. Let's go after this more aggressively. The fourth, speaking of our Onsite network, let's transition to an on-site mentality for growth. History says we will sign about 5 to 10 a year. In 2015, we had started a transition. We signed about 80. Could we sign 200 in 2016? Five: our comps are going to ease in Q3...

Let's",1434,"Sorry about that, folks. I'm not sure where that came from. Our comps were going to ease a bit in Q3, would allow for mid-single-digit growth in sales, and gives us a little more flexibility on what we could afford to spend as we approach the year. Let's focus on our growth drivers in 2016. Let's demonstrate to ourselves and others that we can grow in this environment, and let our regional vice presidents, our district manager group, our hub manager group, our support leads run their businesses. It's an incredibly talented group. They run an incredibly impressive business. Let them run it. Let's focus on our growth drivers. And points 7, 8, 9 and 10, serve your customers, serve them every day, improve their business and ours and be creative. We will grow. What are some of the realities of the year? We are opening some stores. We'll open about 30 -- we'll have opened between 35 and 40 stores for the year. I think that's a good number for us in 2016. 
One item that changed on our stores is in May of 2016, the Department of Labor published some new rules regarding exempt employees. This rule, while it doesn't impact our company in totality because it essentially raised the threshold of what qualifies as an exempt employee from -- there's rules for duties that qualify you, and there's also a rule for pay, and those rules were increased dramatically in 2016.  Because of that change, it does impact our smaller stores because in our smaller stores, we don't always compensate above that $48,000 level because we have folks that are building a business, and we're a sales-minded organization, but the opportunity is huge. But as you all know from the years of us publishing our pathway to profit data, stores under the $75,000 amount are not profitable -- are marginally profitable, and this damages that, and we decided to close some stores. 
We moved fairly aggressively on it. We closed 65 stores in Q3. We have another 32 stores queued up to close in Q4, and we're also evaluating another group we're going to look at in 2017. But because of the close to 100 stores that we identified for closure, we did book up a reserve in the third quarter for those closures primarily related to the occupancy, but we moved fairly quickly on it. 
These closures should have a minimum impact on our revenue, similar to closures in the past because the stores have another -- these locations have another store in reasonably close proximity. And as you know from previous conversations, the vast majority of our revenue is business-to-business, most of it going out our back door, and we're delivering to the customer's site. So for serving a market with 5 stores versus 4 stores or 3 stores versus 4 stores doesn't necessarily change our ability to grow or our ability to maintain the business we have. And typically, we maintain 90-plus percent of the business when we close a store. 
But it did change a bit of our thought process, as we've gone through the year just because of the changing landscape, the reality we live in. CSP 16, we moved aggressively on that early in the year. Our store conversion is largely behind us. We believe this broadens our ability to, as I mentioned earlier, be a better same-day supplier, appeal to a broader range of customers. We believe that, ultimately, this will help us as we go in 2017 with our construction customer, but we believe it makes us a more efficient business. 
On vending, our run rate has improved, and we've been signing 4,700 to 4,800 per quarter instead of the closer to 4,000 we were doing in the last 2 years. Right now, our run rate, if you just take that number and annualize it, it's about a 19,000 run rate versus the 16,000 of the last couple of years. This is okay. It's not great. We added 200-and-some people earlier in the year to ramp this number up. That ramp has been moving a little bit slower than I would have liked. I'd like the quarterly number to start with a 5 versus a 4, but we've improved it nicely. 
And I also have to acknowledge the fact that, as you all know from previous calls, we signed a rather sizable vending leasing program earlier in the first half of the year, and we've deployed in the last 4 months roughly 11,000 vending machines into that program. And that's created a little bit of distraction to our program, but I'd still like a number that starts with a 5, but we've made nice progress. 
Regarding the transition to Onsite, I'm frankly impressed with our team. We still have work to do, but I'm impressed with the fact that we've signed 133 year-to-date. That put us on pace to do roughly 180. Our record year last year was 80. I believe we're creating momentum for our business into the future, because the closer we get to the customer, whether that be with our store network, our vending platform or our Onsite, history has demonstrated we take market share when we do that, because we have a servant's heart within our organization. Our covenant with our customer: we will help you be a better business by being a great supplier, a great partner to you. And the Onsite strategy only makes that better. And I'm very pleased with the transition we're making and that I expect us to continue making as we enter 2017.
Point 5, the comps were easing in the third quarter, and that will help us. Unfortunately, we're still stuck in that band of 1 to 3. If you look at it from Q2 to Q3, our sales are treading water, but there's 2 stories going on in there. Our fastener business continues to be weak. That business has been weak since the spring of 2015, and our fastener revenue dropped about $10 million from Q2 to Q3. 
Under the hood, our fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. Under the hood, our non-fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. We didn't execute that -- we haven't been executing that well, in my opinion, in 2016 in general on our freight. Our potential [ph] to charge freight has weakened in the last 6, 7 quarters. Lower fuel prices is part of the reason, discipline is the other, perhaps the marketplace is making it a little bit more challenging to charge freight. But there's still ample examples where we can charge it, and we're not. And we need to be better at executing on that front. But the product margins under the hood, again, we have mix going against us because the fastener business was down about $10 million. We continue to see us inching along and improving the relative gross margin on the components.
If sales are up 5% and -- 5%, 6%, as we were expecting, the fact that our expenses are up a little bit above 5% would be okay, wouldn't be great, but it'd be okay. Unfortunately, that's not the fact pattern, and we're pulling some levers on expenses. One of those levers that we're pulling is to help offset some of the DOL impacts as we go into 2017 to offset some of the investment impacts we made in 2016. 
The regulatory environment, well, you all watch the news. I'm not sharing a secret here. It's not a great environment to do business in, and -- but that's the world we live in, and that's the world we need to contend with. And there's a lot of uncertainty, but the certainty I do know is that we have a great organization, a great group of people out there managing our business. And we're going to continue to focus on our growth drivers, and we're going to continue to let our regional vice presidents, our district managers, our hub managers, our support leads run their respective groups. 
But we'll need to be mindful of the environment we're in. It's a different earnings call for me this quarter, and as the last couple of quarters have been, in that I don't have a bunch of spreadsheets sitting in front of me, ready to answer any and every question. Just talking about the business and I'm upbeat about our business as I look forward. There's a lot of good things from a momentum standpoint, but it was a tough quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

We did like that the quarter finished in September with a daily sales rate up 2.8%. But as you all know, the comparison did get quite a bit easier, and that's a pattern that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. Qualitatively, it's not clear to us that the tone changed much in the third quarter. We saw that the sales of fasteners into heavy manufacturing and construction end markets were relatively weak, as we've seen before. The same could be said of our largest customers. Our top 100 was flat to maybe down slightly during the period, but again, these are the same dynamics that have persisted throughout 2016. If there was any incremental change, it may have been that the U.S. business grew a little less quickly while Canada and Mexico actually strengthened. But at the end of the day, it all blended into what we thought was a fairly consistent quarterly sales performance. 
This sluggishness does mask the progress we're making on our growth drivers. Dan alluded to some of this, but we did sign over 4,700 vending machines in the third quarter. Our total installed base rose by more than 2,000 units. We now have 60,000 -- more than 60,000 in the field. That's a figure that does not include the machines that are related to our leased locker program, which is being rolled out as we expected it to be. 
We also signed 41 Onsites in the third quarter. We're up to about 133 year-to-date. The SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative are growing faster than the company as a whole, and we'll provide some additional insights into the CSP 16 and Onsite initiatives after the fourth quarter. But again, overall, we think that those initiatives are proceeding nicely.
In terms of gross profit, our gross margin was 49.3% in the third quarter. That's down 120 basis points annually and that's down 20 basis points versus last quarter. We discussed the gross margin ramifications related to the relative growth of our non-fastener large customer mix in the short and intermediate term, and that dynamic was significant in the annual decline we saw this quarter. In particular fasteners, as you saw as a percentage of sales, that's down 180 basis points year-over-year to 36.1%. That does have an impact on our gross margin overall.
That was also a factor in our modest sequential decline. But that said, we were a bit disappointed that the gross margin slipped in the third quarter. We looked at the gross margin of the fastener and non-fastener categories. They remained stable. We did good work there. We don't believe that we saw any meaningful pressure within the product categories themselves. We did see higher freight costs this quarter. That relates to both the weak demand, also, perhaps, our own diligence around inventory levels during the quarter. But regardless, the freight was a significant contributor to the downward drift we saw in the sequential gross margin, Q2 to Q3 of '16. 
In terms of operating expenses, our operating margin was 20% in the quarter. That's down 210 basis points annually and down 60 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 115 people. That decline was greater in our part-time labor. As a result, the full-time equivalent headcount was actually still up 1.4% in the quarter, and that reflects both the Fasteners Inc. acquisition, as well as the additions we made to vending and Onsites. Sequentially, total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 460 people. The full-time equivalent was down 4.8%, and that just relates to what's become prudent headcount management, given the sluggish demand environment and our efforts to prune some of our stores. We did see an increase in health care expenses in this quarter. However, overall, the employee-related expense as a percentage of sales, we thought, were stable year-over-year, and frankly, improved slightly sequentially.
Occupancy, expenses there were up both on an annual and sequential basis. This relates to 3 things: first and most significantly is the continued growth in our vending equipment. Revenues through our vending machines were still up almost 10% in the third quarter. That's well above our corporate growth, so we feel good about these investments. Secondly, we continue to invest in our distribution infrastructure, primarily related to automation initiatives we've had underway. We think that, that will contribute to long-term productivity. And then third, in the third quarter, the expense was also lifted due to the closing of those 65 stores. For those reasons in the short term and given the current environment, occupancy expenses are certainly playing a material role in pushing down our near-term margin.
Cash flow generation. We generated $133 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's down about 5% versus last year, really related just to the lower income this period, but it does represent 105% of this quarter's net income, which is actually slightly better than last year. We did have a free cash deficit of about $27 million. That includes our having paid our dividend. But we also saw capital spending rise, and that's simply a function of the leased locker program with Walmart and sort of the costs related to that. We didn't buy back any shares in the period, and we did add about $15 million in debt to finance the free cash shortfall.
Lastly, on balance sheet, our total debt at the end of the third quarter is now about $445 million. That is up $130 million from the end of third quarter last year. On a net cash basis, our total debt now is 13.5% of total capital, up marginally from 10.2% in the same period a year ago. That rise is modest, and it relates to the modest free cash generation we've had from lower earnings; the higher inventories we put out there due to CSP 16; some stock repurchase; and of course, the payment of our dividend. 
We do view the balance sheet as being conservatively capitalized, and we have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business and pay our dividend. In terms of working capital, this will be my last comment, we were comfortable with how the numbers shook out. The receivables came in at about 49.7 days. That is comparable to where it was year ago. Inventories came in at 159.6. That's well ahead of where we were a year ago, but that was expected. It does reflect our infusing the CSP 16 products into the field; the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc., which will anniversary in November; and the increase in Onsite locations. 
But the annual increase in dollar inventories was 9.5%. That was -- that did achieve our goal of keeping growth below 10%. So overall, we're comfortable with where the condition of our balance sheet is, given the effect of the significant growth investments that have impacted it. That's all I have, and with that, I'll -- we'll turn it over to questions."

Right now, our operating expenses are up about 5% year-over-year, some of that because of the investments we've made. We need to structurally lower that, probably closer to 3.5% to 4%, so that at 3.5% to 4% revenue growth we can let that shine through. Obviously, one thing that's inherent in our numbers right now is of the accordions that are within the -- if you think of the cost structure of Fastenal, our incentive comp is at an incredibly low point right now. So we have to be very mindful of the structural expenses we're adding as we look into 2017 and '18 because we know there will be some expansion in that cost pool as we go into '17 and '18 and that's, frankly, a good thing. That was also -- I'm not going to point -- paint the picture of the DOL rule changes were the only reason we closed some stores. They were a reason we moved pretty quickly.

The CSP 16, those -- the margins on those products are nicely above the company average. That has as much to do about the mix of who that business is going to as it is about the actual products. Because in the CSP 16, there's a fairly strong mixture of tool categories, et cetera, that don't necessarily have a higher gross margin. But the mix of customers is beneficial in that business. So that CSP 16 has a positive influence overall to gross margin, albeit a relatively small impact on the relative dollars."

I'm wondering if you're seeing any changes in how the market approaches freight because, obviously, a lot of consumer markets, consumers expect free shipping.

One is if you think of our growth drivers, both short term and multiyear, our growth drivers are -- lend themselves towards things that really don't have a freight component to them. Vending, there really isn't a freight component to vending. So that business, that growth, that $600 million-plus business a year is freight-free because it's part of the offering we have. If you think of CSP 16 by placing it in the store, those products don't really lend themselves to having freight charged on them, whereas perhaps in the past there would have been freight on some of that revenue. Again, that's a relatively small impact. One of the selling impacts or selling philosophies of the Onsite is that by moving in Onsite facilities, there are certain costs we can strip out. One of them is some of your working capital costs because we can stock that inventory because we're a more efficient supply chain. Some of that is because we're more orderly in what we're ordering and our visibility to when we see the -- we learn about transactions before they become quotes and purchase orders, and so we can be more efficient on how we manage our freight costs. So those are structural changes over time that aren't necessarily detrimental in the true sense of the word. I think one of the things that can happen when you're going through this environment of some of the structural changes don't necessarily have a freight component to them is that you can convince yourself that maybe the other pieces don't have as great a propensity to have freight on them as they did in the past. Maybe that piece of that is the tone of the leaders of the organization, and I look at myself when I say that. Maybe I'm not pushing it hard enough. But it's the case of sometimes you can convince yourself on why you can't do some stuff, and you need to convince yourself on why you can, why you should. And I think that's probably the bigger culprit in this equation than the marketplace. Because the marketplace doesn't change that abruptly to explain some of the degradation we had."

But they're still negative. And we'll see how the next couple of months, couple -- and the next quarter plays out on that space. But I think that the real emphasis that we would make -- and I guess this came about, about question of bottoming, we're not seeing things get a lot better. If those customers get better, it's because the comps are getting easier. Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised, and demand will actually improve from here going forward.

I -- we had quite a few vending machines that have been running negative and vending relationships that have been running negative. And I asked our team to take a look at this group of vending machines, and it's a sizable group of vending machines. So it was the population you'd look at, and you could actually glean some knowledge from it. We took a good hard look at it, and what we saw -- because one thing -- one visibility we have into our customers' business that we've never had before is the insight into how many unique people are using the device. We -- if there's 100 employees that are in this customer's facility, you know that because those 100 people are in the database of people that can use the vending platform, and it also -- what of those 100 people can get these products versus those products. If I'm in the welding area, I have access to the welding tips. But if I'm not in the welding area, I don't have access to those 6 buttons, if you will. And -- or those 6 products. And one thing that jumped out for us where we had vending machines that were negative, and again, it was a sizable number, is the number of employees in the database right now versus a year ago had dropped. In that group, the number of employees had dropped about 10%. And I don't recall offhand how many customer locations this included. But that tells me we have a bunch of customers -- and our fastener business was negative at those customers. We have a bunch of customers who had downsized some operations. Maybe they have fewer shifts. Maybe they have fewer people per shift. But they had downsized in this group about 10% actual headcount, and we were seeing in those machines revenue down in the teens. So that's a case of there was some serious belt-tightening going on. But there was just a drop in consumption because there was a drop in the workload at that business. And that's -- the economics are such that if there's fewer employees from a year ago, they need fewer safety glasses and gloves and the consumables that go with having people."

I like the fact that we have a voice at the table that is going to challenge us to think about our business differently, the fact that -- think about our working capital, to think about our capital structure: to just think about the business in general a little bit differently. It doesn't mean we're going to change suddenly on our appetite for doing different things because we've changed our appetite in that over the last 2 years.
