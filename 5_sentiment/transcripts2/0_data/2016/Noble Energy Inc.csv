For more than a decade now, Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment. I'm proud of what we've accomplished last year and I feel good about how we are positioned moving through this challenging time. 
I'd like to start today's call with a few highlights wrapping up 2015 before focusing on our plans for 2016. Fourth quarter results show our continued operating momentum and focus on prudently managing within cash flow. For the second straight quarter, discretionary cash flow exceeded capital requirements -- capital expenditures. This reflects our asset quality, our portfolio diversity and the ability of our organization to execute. It's also a testament to the swift, decisive actions we took to reduce spending and drive capital efficiency beginning more than a year ago. 
Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 422,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was above the high end of our increased guidance. This was driven by the accelerated project start-ups in the Gulf of Mexico, strong asset performance in Equatorial Guinea and Israel, and continued improvement in completion design and infrastructure capacity in the DJ Basin. 
Looking at our full year 2015 accomplishments, it was a year of outstanding operational and strategic execution under the backdrop of a difficult commodity environment. We began last year targeting increased production capacity from our DJ Basin asset, more recognition of the value in our Eastern Mediterranean projects and alignment with our Marcellus partner for future capital spend. By year's end, we had accomplished each of these objectives while transforming our cost structure to match the current environment. This was all achieved while realizing record-safety performance across the business. 
In addition, we took advantage of an opportunity to expand our leading U.S. unconventional portfolio with new top-tier positions in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Initial operating results have exceeded expectations and highlight Noble's technical proficiency with new completion designs and drilling efficiencies.  Our major project execution capabilities were again evident in 2015. We commenced production on both Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico, while keeping Gunflint in the Alba compression project on plan for 2016 start up. In Israel, an approved and implemented natural gas regulatory framework gives us substantial momentum for future projects and the regulatory clarity necessary for new development to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas.  We ended 2015 with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which was up slightly versus year end 2014. Excluding the impact of the Rosetta Resources merger and SEC commodity price changes, we replaced 1.5x 2015 production at a replacement cost of around $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. Total organic capital for 2015 was under $2.9 billion, down approximately 40% from the previous year, while unit operating costs were driven to their lowest point in 8 years. At the same time, our average full year reported sales volumes were up nearly 20% over the year before. Part of the increase was the addition of the new Texas assets, but our legacy volumes grew more than 10% by themselves. 
I would now like to take a few moments to describe how we're moving forward in the current environment. Noble Energy is an 84-year-old company. We've been through many cycles before. We believe our high-quality, low-cost and diversified portfolio, combined with capital discipline and tremendous investment flexibility, provides the best formula for the long-term sustainable value creation. Look at 2015 and 2016. Without question, we are achieving more, while spending less. As I look across the E&P spectrum, I believe Noble Energy is competitively advantaged for the future. Protecting the balance is fundamental in this environment. That is why we are committed to managing total cash outflows within total cash inflows at the company level. We started 2016 with $5 billion of liquidity, including $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. This liquidity has already been further bolstered this year by approximately $200 million in cash proceeds from nonproducing Eastern Mediterranean asset sales. An additional $200 million of capacity was created through the recent dividend adjustment and debt refinancing. We also intend to reduce leverage using additional cash flow from operations or portfolio proceeds beyond what has been captured to date. Cash flow for the year is positively impacted by our hedging position, which covers approximately 35% of our global oil and 25% of our U.S. gas production. As we survey investment opportunities against the outlook for commodity prices, current returns do not justify prior activity levels. We're again pulling back capital aggressively in 2016 and focusing only in those areas where long-term value opportunities make sense. We've further reduced our capital program by nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This will allow us to maintain financial strength and sustain underlying operating capabilities. As part of our intense scrutiny on capital allocation, our operating teams continue to improve capital efficiency, while ensuring that each dollar spent is justified by the future value created. This focus, along with our ability to monetize additional assets, gives us flexibility to adjust in a volatile price environment. 
This year's program targets 2/3 of our capital to the U.S. unconventional business and 1/3 to development and exploration offshore. Gary will go through our detailed development programs in a moment, but first I want to briefly cover our exploration plans and production outlook for the year. Our organic exploration strategy has generated substantial value and created long-term cash flows for Noble over the years. In 2016, we're focused on drilling 2 to 3 offshore wells, while obtaining and interpreting seismic to open up future value opportunities. We see this as a great environment to deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. 
Now turning to production. In 2016, we expect to deliver volumes of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is up 10% on a full year reported basis and essentially flat to the pro forma 2015 level. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect the first and third quarters to be higher volume than the second and fourth, with the second half of the year generally equal to the first. We've had a strong start to the year, and I'm optimistic that we can drive new capital and operating efficiencies to outperform our goals. 
In the slides for this conference call, we've provided detailed full year and first quarter guidance. First quarter volumes reflect downtime for the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. 
I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham, who will review recent performance and the 2016 program at the asset level."

As Dave noted, from an efficiency and cost perspective, the company is firing on all cylinders, and I'm extremely pleased with the results we are delivering. I believe there's a strong correlation between our record safety and exceptional operating performance. 
I'll start our asset level discussion with the DJ Basin. Fourth quarter total production of 121,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected continued improvement in completion performance and infrastructure development. The DJ Basin was, once again, a big contributor to the company's lower operating costs and production outperformance. Essentially all of the growth in the DJ versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 has come from liquids, with most of that, oil. The December start up of the Grand Parkway system further reduce line pressures to the lowest levels we can remember and should provide redundancy and improved throughput. Noble's operated Keota plant in East Pony, which came online mid-year 2015, is also running well, supporting our activity in that area. After drilling and completing horizontals in the DJ Basin for more than 5 years now, our team is still driving step changes in drilling results and well performance. Our full year 2015 average drilling cost per lateral foot was down 40% from 2014. As well cost have been substantially reduced, we've also enhanced production performance with optimized completion designs. We continue to focus on slick water as our standard frac load design, which is consistently delivering lower costs and enhanced production per well. The next step in completion innovation and capital efficiency is utilizing the completion design that will allow slick water fracs to be pumped to the tow on long laterals and also with higher proppant concentrations. Actual results on both hybrid gel and slick water wells with higher proppant concentration are exhibiting better initial production and flatter declines compared to our historical jobs. 
For 2016, we plan to operate 2 rigs for the full year, focusing on the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. These are our highest valued IDPs, with strong oil contributions and existing infrastructure already in place. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is just under $600 billion. 70% of the DJ Basin well to be drilled in 2016 are planned to be extended reach, many of which will be 9,000-foot laterals in Wells Ranch. We are targeting the drilling of 150 equivalent wells this year, and expect to commence production on slightly more than 200 equivalents.  While these lower activity levels suggest that DJ production will be down somewhat from last year, I'm optimistic that these new completion designs can help offset some of the potential declines. 
Moving over to our Texas assets. I'm pleased with our integration efforts in 2015 and believe we're making good progress in optimizing the performance of these assets. During the fourth quarter, we started production on our first 5 Noble design completions in the Eagle Ford. And based on our review of public data, our first 3 design completions, which tested wider lateral spacing and higher profit concentrations are among the most productive Eagle Ford wells ever completed. We also announced 30-day results on 2 additional wells today. The average 30-day IP for these wells was over 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and this is remarkable when you look on the fact that they were drilled by Rosetta on tighter 500-foot lateral spacing. Production from these 2 wells were normalized to a 5,000-foot lateral is also significantly above our 3 million-barrel EUR type curve which is based on wider lateral spacing. Capital allocation for the Texas assets is approximately $250 million. 60% is expected to be spent in the Eagle Ford, primarily to continue Gate Ranch development. The remaining 40% will be spent to begin our operational appraisal work in the Delaware Basin. Our first 2 completions in the Delaware are beginning production in this month. And while we have flow back capital in these assets from prior expectations, I still expect higher volumes in 2016 versus 2015 pro forma driven mostly by the Eagle Ford. In the Marcellus, total capital for this year is currently planned at $150 million. We've reduced activity to 0 drilling rigs with plans for the JV to be cash flow neutral. Focus will be on a limited number on completions in the nonoperated dry gas area and will be weighted towards the first half of the year. As such, this is expected to deliver modestly higher volumes versus full year 2015. The Gulf of Mexico finished the year strongly with Big Bend and Dantzler starting production during the fourth quarter, ahead of schedule and on budget. Our Gulf of Mexico strategy of pursuing high-quality reservoirs near existing infrastructure generates substantial value. A full year of Big Bend and Dantzler, along with Gunflint start-up, will contribute significant year-on-year oil volume growth during the coming year. Noble's Gulf of Mexico budget is $250 million for 2016. As we complete the Gunflint project, the vast majority of capital will be for exploration and appraisal activities. The lineup includes the Silvergate prospect, which is currently drilling, an appraisal well for our 2014 Katmai oil discovery. Silvergate is a Miocene target with a resource range between 30 and 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross, with nearby subsea tieback potential. And results are expected by the end of the first quarter. In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged to 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 9% from the same period last year, mainly due to robust power generation demand. Strong natural gas demand is continuing out to 2016, not only from this year's early cold weather, but also from the expanded use of natural gas over other power generation source fuels. In 2016, we have included approximately $100 million for pre-FID capital expenditures on our Eastern Mediterranean projects. The region is fundamentally short gas and we'll focus this year on finalizing gas sales agreement within Israel and with multiple regional customers. As we progress the technical and commercial readiness of our projects, we are operating with the following principals: First and foremost, ensure that our development concepts match market demand; second, we remain focused on meeting and growing demand for natural gas within Israel, while diversifying our regional market opportunities; and third, we are managing project risk through financing, including the potential involvement of international financial institutions. 
I'd now like to take a couple of minutes and provide an update on our current thinking about the Leviathan development. Along with our FPSO development concept, we are also progressing another design that utilizes a fixed platform to ensure timely first production. The initial development under this fixed platform concept will be anchored by Israeli domestic demand, Jordan power needs and Egyptian industrial demand. While continuing to refine the technical requirements, initial capacity can start at over 1 BCF -- billion cubic feet of gas per day, and is quickly expendable to more than 2 BCF a day. This option provides the most flexibility to match contracted volumes with accelerated development, while retaining the capability to meet existing and growing demand. As you would expect, preproduction capital outlays can be substantially reduced by this design modification, along with the current service cost environment. This will all be firmed up as we move through 2016 securing necessary gas contracts, recosting the final technical project and finalizing project financing to move forward to FID. Additionally, we continue to work with LNG plant owners in the region to secure gas contracts. The combination of our high-quality Eastern Mediterranean reservoirs with idle LNG plants positions us well to be competitive in the global LNG world. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks."

As you look beyond '16 and to 2017, you have to look at the pieces of the portfolio and kind of just think through each one of those and how they are impacted. The Eastern Med for example, it's going to be flat to up, depending on demand. In the Gulf of Mexico, we should see some improvement in '17 versus '16 because you're bringing Isabella back on, we've got Isabella work over here in the first quarter impacting '16. We'll bring that back on, so you'll have impact of Isabella, and then you'll have a full year of Gunflint in '17. West Africa, you'll have the full year of Alba, which has been impacted this year and '16 by the downtime on the compression project. And that should offset decline on word. So West Africa should be flat to potentially up. So the international offshore portfolio give you good sustenance, if you will, underlaying the production basin. Then in the U.S, I would assume the Texas properties will continue to grow in '17. And then at the current type investment levels, you could see some declines in the Marcellus and the DJ. But when you think about '17 overall, the way I think about it, that's kind of 2016 spending level, you probably remain fairly flat. I think a lot of work and the length of time going to go by on looking at where we want to set up the 2017 program before we go too far down the road as to what we'd actually be spending."

There's a mix of different contracts and what you're competing with. You're competing, in some cases, against importing LNG or higher cost fuels into countries at different points. On some places like that existing idle LNG plant, you're looking at what makes sense there given that you've got a high quality known gas source that you can tie-in with probably one of the lowest cost LNG plants in the world. So you're kind of balancing both of those types of contract and potential pricing outlook. So each one has a different characteristic. I'll let Keith talk about how he is seeing things playing out."

For more than a decade now, Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment. I'm proud of what we've accomplished last year and I feel good about how we're positioned moving through this challenging time.  I'd like to start today's call with a few highlights wrapping up 2015, before focusing on our plans for 2016. 
Fourth quarter results show our continued operating momentum and focus on prudently managing within cash flow. For the second straight quarter, discretionary cash flow exceeded capital requirements -- capital expenditures. This reflects our asset quality, our portfolio diversity and the ability of our organization to execute. It's also a testament to the swift, decisive actions we took to reduce spending and drive capital efficiency beginning more than a year ago. 
Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 422,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was above the high end of our increased guidance. This was driven by the accelerated project start-ups in the Gulf of Mexico, strong asset performance in Equatorial Guinea and Israel, and continued improvement in completion design and infrastructure capacity in the DJ Basin. 
Looking at our full year 2015 accomplishments, it was a year of outstanding operational and strategic execution under the backdrop of a difficult commodity environment. We began last year targeting increased production capacity from our DJ Basin asset, more recognition of the value in our Eastern Mediterranean projects and alignment with our Marcellus partner for future capital spend. By year's end, we had accomplished each of these objectives while transforming our cost structure to match the current environment. This was all achieved while realizing record safety performance across the business. 
In addition, we took advantage of an opportunity to expand our leading U.S. unconventional portfolio with new top-tier positions in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Initial operating results have exceeded expectations and highlight Noble's technical proficiency with new completion designs and drilling efficiencies.
Our major project execution capabilities were again evident in 2015. We commenced production on both Big Bend and Dantzler on the Gulf of Mexico, while keeping Gunflint and the Alba compression project on plan for 2016 start-up. In Israel, an approved and implemented natural gas regulatory framework gives us substantial momentum for future projects and the regulatory clarity necessary for new development to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas.
We ended 2015 with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which was up slightly versus year-end 2014. Excluding the impact of the Rosetta Resources merger and SEC commodity price changes, we replaced 1.5x 2015 production at a replacement cost of around $16 per barrel of oil equivalent.
Total organic capital for 2015 was under $2.9 billion, down approximately 40% from the previous year, while unit operating costs were driven to their lowest point in 8 years. At the same time, our average full year reported sales volumes were up nearly 20% over the year before. Part of the increase was the addition of the new Texas assets, but our legacy volumes grew more than 10% by themselves. 
I would now like to take a few moments to describe how we're moving forward in the current environment. Noble Energy is an 84-year-old company. We've been through many cycles before. We believe our high-quality, low-cost and diversified portfolio, combined with capital discipline and tremendous investment flexibility, provides the best formula for long-term sustainable value creation. Look at 2015 and 2016. Without question, we're achieving more, while spending less. As I look across the E&P spectrum, I believe Noble Energy is competitively advantaged for the future.
Protecting the balance sheet is fundamental in this environment. That is why we are committed to managing total cash outflows within total cash inflows at the company level. We started 2016 with $5 billion of liquidity, including $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. This liquidity has already been further bolstered this year by approximately $200 million in cash proceeds from nonproducing Eastern Mediterranean asset sales. An additional $200 million of capacity was created through the recent dividend adjustment and debt refinancing. We also intend to reduce leverage using additional cash flow from operations or portfolio proceeds beyond what has been captured to date.
Cash flow for the year is positively impacted by our hedging position, which covers approximately 35% of our global oil and 25% of our U.S. gas production. As we survey investment opportunities against the outlook for commodity prices, current returns do not justify prior activity levels. We're again pulling back capital aggressively in 2016 and focusing only in those areas where long-term value opportunities make sense.
We've further reduced our capital program by nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This will allow us to maintain financial strength and sustain underlying operating capabilities. As part of our intense scrutiny on capital allocation, our operating teams continue to improve capital efficiency, while ensuring that each dollar spent is justified by the future value created. This focus, along with our ability to monetize additional assets, gives us flexibility to adjust in a volatile price environment. 
This year's program targets 2/3 of our capital to the U.S. unconventional business and 1/3 to development and exploration offshore. Gary will go through our detailed development programs in a moment, but first I want to briefly cover our exploration plans and production outlook for the year.
Our organic exploration strategy has generated substantial value and created long-term cash flows for Noble over the years. In 2016, we're focused on drilling 2 to 3 offshore wells, while obtaining and interpreting seismic to open up future value opportunities. We see this as a great environment to deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. 
Now turning to production. In 2016, we expect to deliver volumes of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is up 10% on a full year reported basis and essentially flat to the pro forma 2015 level. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect the first and third quarters to be higher volume than the second and fourth, with the second half of the year generally equal to the first. We've had a strong start to the year, and I'm optimistic that we can drive new capital and operating efficiencies to outperform our goals. 
In the slides for this conference call, we've provided detailed full year and first quarter guidance. First quarter volumes reflect downtime for the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. 
I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham, who will review recent performance and the 2016 program at the asset level."

As Dave noted, from an efficiency and cost perspective, the company is firing on all cylinders, and I'm extremely pleased with the results we are delivering. I believe there's a strong correlation between our record safety and exceptional operating performance. 
I'll start our asset-level discussion with the DJ Basin. Fourth quarter total production of 121,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected continued improvement in completion performance and infrastructure development. The DJ Basin was, once again, a big contributor to the company's lower operating costs and production outperformance. Essentially all of the growth in the DJ versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 has come from liquids, with most of that, oil.
The December start-up of the Grand Parkway system further reduce line pressures to the lowest levels we can remember and should provide redundancy and improved throughput. Noble's operated Keota plant in East Pony, which came online mid-year 2015, is also running well, supporting our activity in that area. After drilling and completing horizontals in the DJ Basin for more than 5 years now, our team is still driving step changes in drilling results and well performance.
Our full year 2015 average drilling cost per lateral foot was down 40% from 2014. As well cost have been substantially reduced, we've also enhanced production performance with optimized completion designs. We continue to focus on  slickwater as our standard frac fluid design, which is consistently delivering lower costs and enhanced production per well.
The next step in completion, innovation and capital efficiency is utilizing the completion design that will allow our slickwater fracs to be pumped to the tow on long laterals and also with higher proppant concentrations. Actual results on both hybrid gel and slickwater wells with higher proppant concentration are exhibiting better initial production and flatter declines compared to our historical jobs. 
For 2016, we plan to operate 2 rigs for the full year, focusing on the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. These are our highest-value IDPs, with strong oil contributions and existing infrastructure already in place. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is just under $600 billion. 70% of the DJ Basin well to be drilled in 2016 are planned to be extended reach, many of which will be 9,000-foot laterals in Wells Ranch. We are targeting the drilling of 150 equivalent wells this year, and expect to commence production on slightly more than 200 equivalents.  While these lower activity levels suggest that DJ production will be down somewhat from last year, I'm optimistic that these new completion designs can help offset some of the potential declines. 
Moving over to our Texas assets. I'm pleased with our integration efforts in 2015 and believe we're making good progress in optimizing the performance of these assets. During the fourth quarter, we started production on our first 5 Noble design completions in the Eagle Ford. And based on our review of public data, our first 3 design completions, which tested wider lateral spacing and higher profit concentrations, are among the most productive Eagle Ford wells ever completed.
We also announced 30-day results on 2 additional wells today. The average 30-day IP for these wells was over 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And this is remarkable, when you look on the fact that they were drilled by Rosetta on tighter 500-foot lateral spacing. Production from these 2 wells when normalized to a 5,000-foot lateral is also significantly above our 3 million-barrel EUR type curve, which is based on wider lateral spacing.
Capital allocation for the Texas assets is approximately $250 million. 60% is expected to be spent in the Eagle Ford, primarily to continue Gates Ranch development. The remaining 40% will be spent to begin our operated appraisal work in the Delaware Basin. Our first 2 completions in the Delaware are beginning production this month. And while we have pulled back capital in these assets from prior expectations, I still expect higher volumes in 2016 versus 2015 pro forma, driven mostly by the Eagle Ford.
In the Marcellus, total capital for this year is currently planned at $150 million. We've reduced activity to 0 drilling rigs with plans for the JV to be cash flow neutral. Focus will be on a limited number on completions in the nonoperated dry gas area and will be weighted towards the first half of the year. As such, this is expected to deliver modestly higher volumes versus full year 2015.
The Gulf of Mexico finished the year strongly, with Big Bend and Dantzler starting production during the fourth quarter, ahead of schedule and on budget. Our Gulf of Mexico strategy of pursuing high-quality reservoirs near existing infrastructure generates substantial value. A full year of Big Bend and Dantzler, along with the Gunflint start-up, will contribute significant year-on-year oil volume growth during the coming year.
Noble's Gulf of Mexico budget is $250 million for 2016. As we complete the Gunflint project, the vast majority of capital will be for exploration and appraisal activities. The lineup includes the Silvergate prospect, which is currently drilling, an appraisal well for our 2014 Katmai oil discovery. Silvergate is a Miocene target with a resource range between 30 and 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross, with nearby subsea tieback potential, and results are expected by the end of the first quarter.
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged to 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 9% from the same period last year, mainly due to robust power generation demand. Strong natural gas demand is continuing into 2016, not only from this year's early cold weather, but also from the expanded use of natural gas over other power generation source fuels. In 2016, we have included approximately $100 million for pre-FID capital expenditures on our Eastern Mediterranean projects. The region is fundamentally short gas and we'll focus this year on finalizing gas sales agreements within Israel and with multiple regional customers.
As we progress the technical and commercial readiness of our projects, we are operating with the following principles: First and foremost, ensure that our development concepts match market demand; second, we remain focused on meeting and growing demand for natural gas within Israel, while diversifying our regional market opportunities; and third, we are managing project risk through financing, including the potential involvement of international financial institutions. 
I'd now like to take a couple of minutes and provide an update on our current thinking about the Leviathan development. Along with our FPSO development concept, we are also progressing another design that utilizes a fixed platform to ensure timely first production. The initial development under this fixed platform concept would be anchored by Israeli domestic demand, Jordan power needs and Egyptian industrial demand. While continuing to refine the technical requirements, initial capacity can start at over 1 BCF, billion cubic feet, of gas per day, and is quickly expendable to more than 2 BCF a day. This option provides the most flexibility to match contracted volumes with accelerated development, while retaining the capability to meet existing and growing demand.
As you would expect, preproduction capital outlays can be substantially reduced by this design modification, along with the current service cost environment. This will all be firmed up as we move through 2016 securing necessary gas contracts, recosting the final technical project and finalizing project financing to move forward to FID. Additionally, we continue to work with LNG plant owners in the region to secure gas contracts. The combination of our high-quality Eastern Mediterranean reservoirs with the idle LNG plants positions us well to be competitive in the global LNG world. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks."

As you look beyond '16 and to 2017, you have to look at the pieces of the portfolio and kind of just think through each one of those and how they are impacted. The Eastern Med, for example, it's going to be flat to up depending on demand. In the Gulf of Mexico, we should see some improvement in '17 versus '16 because you're bringing Isabela back on. We've got Isabela work over here in the first quarter impacting '16. We'll bring that back on, so you'll have impact of Isabela, and then you'll have a full year of Gunflint in '17. West Africa, you'll have the full year of Alba, which has been impacted this year and '16 by the downtime on the compression project, and that should offset decline on Aseng and Alen. So West Africa should be flat to potentially up. So the international offshore portfolio give you good sustenance, if you will, underlying the production basin. Then in the U.S, I would assume the Texas properties will continue to grow in '17. And then at the current type investment levels, you could see some declines in the Marcellus and the DJ. But when you think about '17 overall, the way I think about it, at kind of a 2016 spending level, you'd probably remain fairly flat. But I think a lot of work and a lot of time is going to go by on looking at where we want to set up the 2017 program before we go too far down the road as to what we'd actually be spending."

Our intent will be not to add the equity in from -- into Israel, but rather leverage the things that Dave talked about in terms of some partial monetization of assets. We just had -- realized $200 million from nonproducing assets there. And so, I think the financing will be either a project finance or an RBL type of financing. For our share, it will count as debt. If it's project financed, it still probably will be counted as debt, we'll think about it that way.

292135,321989381,934855,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. For more than a decade now, Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment.

For more than a decade now, Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment. I'm proud of what we've accomplished last year and I feel good about how we are positioned moving through this challenging time.  I'd like to start today's call with a few highlights wrapping up 2015, before focusing on our plans for 2016. 
Fourth quarter results show our continued operating momentum and focus on prudently managing within cash flow. For the second straight quarter, discretionary cash flow exceeded capital requirements -- capital expenditures. This reflects our asset quality, our portfolio diversity and the ability of our organization to execute. It's also a testament to the swift, decisive actions we took to reduce spending and drive capital efficiency beginning more than a year ago. 
          Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 422,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was above the high end of our increased guidance. This was driven by accelerated project start-ups in the Gulf of Mexico, strong asset performance in Equatorial Guinea and Israel, and continued improvement in completion design and infrastructure capacity in the DJ Basin. 
          Looking at our full year 2015 accomplishments, it was a year of outstanding operational and strategic execution under the backdrop of a difficult commodity environment. We began last year targeting increased production capacity from our DJ Basin asset, more recognition of the value in our Eastern Mediterranean projects and alignment with our Marcellus partner for future capital spend. By year's end, we had accomplished each of these objectives while transforming our cost structure to match the current environment. This was all achieved while realizing record safety performance across the business. 
          In addition, we took advantage of an opportunity to expand our leading U.S. unconventional portfolio with new top-tier positions in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Initial operating results have exceeded expectations and highlight Noble's technical proficiency with new completion designs and drilling efficiencies.
Our major project execution capabilities were again evident in 2015. We commenced production on both Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico, while keeping Gunflint and the Alba compression project on plan for 2016 start-up. In Israel, an approved and implemented natural gas regulatory framework gives us substantial momentum for future projects and the regulatory clarity necessary for new development to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas.
We ended 2015 with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which was up slightly versus year-end 2014. Excluding the impact of the Rosetta Resources merger and SEC commodity price changes, we replaced 1.5x 2015 production at a replacement cost of around $16 per barrel of oil equivalent.
Total organic capital for 2015 was under $2.9 billion, down approximately 40% from the previous year, while unit operating costs were driven to their lowest point in 8 years. At the same time, our average full year reported sales volumes were up nearly 20% over the year before. Part of the increase was the addition of the new Texas assets, but our legacy volumes grew more than 10% by themselves. 
          I would now like to take a few moments to describe how we're moving forward in the current environment. Noble Energy is an 84-year-old company. We've been through many cycles before. We believe our high-quality, low-cost and diversified portfolio, combined with capital discipline and tremendous investment flexibility, provides the best formula for long-term sustainable value creation. Look at 2015 and 2016. Without question, we're achieving more, while spending less. As I look across the E&P spectrum, I believe Noble Energy is competitively advantaged for the future.
Protecting the balance sheet is fundamental in this environment. That is why we are committed to managing total cash outflows within total cash inflows at the company level. We've started 2016 with $5 billion of liquidity, including $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. This liquidity has already been further bolstered this year by approximately $200 million in cash proceeds from nonproducing Eastern Mediterranean asset sales. An additional $200 million of capacity was created through the recent dividend adjustment and debt refinancing. We also intend to reduce leverage using additional cash flow from operations or portfolio proceeds beyond what has been captured to date.
Cash flow for the year is positively impacted by our hedging position, which covers approximately 35% of our global oil and 25% of our U.S. gas production. As we survey investment opportunities against the outlook for commodity prices, current returns do not justify prior activity levels. We're again pulling back capital aggressively in 2016 and focusing only in those areas where long-term value opportunities make sense.
We have further reduced our capital program by nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This will allow us to maintain financial strength and sustain underlying operating capabilities. As part of our intense scrutiny on capital allocation, our operating teams continue to improve capital efficiency, while ensuring that each dollar spent is justified by the future value created. This focus, along with our ability to monetize additional assets, gives us flexibility to adjust in a volatile price environment. 
          This year's program targets 2/3 of our capital to the U.S. unconventional business and 1/3 to development and exploration offshore. Gary will go through our detailed development programs in a moment, but first I want to briefly cover our exploration plans and production outlook for the year.
Our organic exploration strategy has generated substantial value and created long-term cash flows for Noble over the years. In 2016, we're focused on drilling 2 to 3 offshore wells, while obtaining and interpreting seismic to open up future value opportunities. We see this as a great environment to deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. 
          Now turning to production. In 2016, we expect to deliver volumes of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is up 10% on a full year reported basis and essentially flat to the pro forma 2015 level. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect the first and third quarters to be higher volume than the second and fourth, with the second half of the year generally equal to the first. We've had a strong start to the year, and I'm optimistic that we can drive new capital and operating efficiencies to outperform our goals. 
          In the slides for this conference call, we've provided detailed full year and first quarter guidance. First quarter volumes reflect downtime for the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. 
          I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham, who will review recent performance and the 2016 program at the asset level."

As Dave noted, from an efficiency and cost perspective, the company is firing on all cylinders, and I'm extremely pleased with the results we are delivering. I believe there's a strong correlation between our record safety and exceptional operating performance. 
          I'll start our asset-level discussion with the DJ Basin. Fourth quarter total production of 121,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected continued improvement in completion performance and infrastructure development. The DJ Basin was, once again, a big contributor to the company's lower operating costs and production outperformance. Essentially all of the growth in the DJ versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 has come from liquids, with most of that, oil.
The December start-up of the Grand Parkway system further reduced line pressures to the lowest levels we can remember and should provide redundancy and improved throughput. Noble's operated Keota plant in East Pony, which came online mid-year 2015, is also running well, supporting our activity in that area. After drilling and completing horizontals in the DJ Basin for more than 5 years now, our team is still driving step changes in drilling results and well performance.
Our full year 2015 average drilling cost per lateral foot was down 40% from 2014. And as well costs have been substantially reduced, we've also enhanced production performance with optimized completion designs. We continue to focus on slickwater as our standard frac fluid design, which is consistently delivering lower costs and enhanced production per well.
The next step in completion, innovation and capital efficiency is utilizing a completion design that will allow slickwater fracs to be pumped to the tow [ph] on long laterals and also with higher proppant concentrations. Actual results on both hybrid gel and slickwater wells with higher proppant concentration are exhibiting better initial production and flatter declines compared to our historical jobs. 
          For 2016, we plan to operate 2 rigs for the full year, focusing in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. These are our highest-value IDPs, with strong oil contributions and existing infrastructure already in place. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is just under $600 billion. 70% of the DJ Basin wells to be drilled in 2016 are planned to be extended reach, many of which will be 9,000-foot laterals in Wells Ranch. We are targeting the drilling of 150 equivalent wells this year, and expect to commence production on slightly more than 200 equivalents.  While these lower activity levels suggest that DJ production will be down somewhat from last year, I'm optimistic that these new completion designs can help offset some of the potential declines. 
          Moving over to our Texas assets. I'm pleased with our integration efforts in 2015 and believe we're making good progress in optimizing the performance of these assets. During the fourth quarter, we started production on our first 5 Noble design completions in the Eagle Ford. And based on our review of public data, our first 3 design completions, which tested wider lateral spacing and higher profit concentrations, are among the most productive Eagle Ford wells ever completed.
We also announced 30-day results on 2 additional wells today. The average 30-day IP for these wells was over 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And this is remarkable, when you look on the fact that they were drilled by Rosetta on tighter 500-foot lateral spacing. Production from these 2 wells when normalized to a 5,000-foot lateral is also significantly above our 3 million-barrel EUR type curve, which is based on wider lateral spacing.
Capital allocation for the Texas assets is approximately $250 million. 60% is expected to be spent in the Eagle Ford, primarily to continue Gates Ranch development. The remaining 40% will be spent to begin our operated appraisal work in the Delaware Basin. Our first 2 completions in the Delaware are beginning production this month. And while we have pulled back capital in these assets from prior expectations, I still expect higher volumes in 2016 versus 2015 pro forma, driven mostly by the Eagle Ford.
In the Marcellus, total capital for this year is currently planned at $150 million. We've reduced activity to 0 drilling rigs with plans for the JV to be cash flow neutral. The focus will be on a limited number on completions in the non-operated dry gas area and will be weighted towards the first half of the year. As such, this is expected to deliver modestly higher volumes versus full year 2015.
The Gulf of Mexico finished the year strongly, with Big Bend and Dantzler starting production during the fourth quarter, ahead of schedule and on budget. Our Gulf of Mexico strategy of pursuing high-quality reservoirs near existing infrastructure generates substantial value. A full year of Big Bend and Dantzler, along with the Gunflint start-up, will contribute significant year-on-year oil volume growth during the coming year.
Noble's Gulf of Mexico budget is $250 million for 2016. As we complete the Gunflint project, the vast majority of capital will be for exploration and appraisal activities. The lineup includes the Silvergate prospect, which is currently drilling, and an appraisal well for our 2014 Katmai oil discovery. Silvergate is a Miocene target with a resource range between 30 and 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross, with nearby subsea tieback potential, and results are expected by the end of the first quarter.
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged to 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 9% from the same period last year, mainly due to robust power generation demand. Strong natural gas demand is continuing into 2016, not only from this year's early cold weather, but also from the expanded use of natural gas over other power generation source fuels. In 2016, we have included approximately $100 million for pre-FID capital expenditures on our Eastern Mediterranean projects. The region is fundamentally short gas and we'll focus this year on finalizing gas sales agreements within Israel and with multiple regional customers.
As we progress the technical and commercial readiness of our projects, we are operating with the following principles: First and foremost, ensure that our development concepts match market demand; second, we remain focused on meeting and growing demand for natural gas within Israel, while diversifying our regional market opportunities; and third, we are managing project risk through financing, including the potential involvement of international financial institutions. 
          I'd now like to take a couple of minutes and provide an update on our current thinking about the Leviathan development. Along with our FPSO development concept, we are also progressing another design that utilizes a fixed platform to ensure timely first production. The initial development under this fixed platform concept would be anchored by Israeli domestic demand, Jordan power needs and Egyptian industrial demand. While continuing to refine the technical requirements, initial capacity could start at over 1 BCF, billion cubic feet, of gas per day, and is quickly expandable to more than 2 BCF a day. This option provides the most flexibility to match contracted volumes with accelerated development, while retaining the capability to meet existing and growing demand.
As you would expect, preproduction capital outlays can be substantially reduced by this design modification, along with the current service cost environment. This will all be firmed up as we move through 2016 securing necessary gas contracts, recosting the final technical project and finalizing project financing to move forward to FID. Additionally, we continue to work with LNG plant owners in the region to secure gas contracts. The combination of our high-quality Eastern Mediterranean reservoirs with idle LNG plants positions us well to be competitive in the global LNG world. 
          Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks."

As you look beyond '16 into 2017, you have to look at the pieces of the portfolio and kind of just think through each one of those and how they are impacted. The Eastern Med, for example, it's going to be flat to up depending on demand. In the Gulf of Mexico, we should see some improvement in '17 versus '16 because you're bringing Isabela back on. We've got an Isabela workover here in the first quarter impacting '16. We'll bring that back on, so you'll have the impact of Isabela, and then you'll have a full year of Gunflint in '17. West Africa, you'll have the full year of Alba, which has been impacted this year, in '16, by the downtime on putting the compression project in. That should offset decline on Aseng and Alen. So West Africa should be flat to potentially up. So the international offshore portfolio will give you good sustenance, if you will, underlying the production basin. Then in the U.S, I would assume the Texas properties will continue to grow in '17. And then at the current-type investment levels, you could see some decline in the Marcellus and the DJ. But when you think about '17 overall, the way I think about it, at kind of the 2016 spending level, you'd probably remain fairly flat. But I think a lot of work and a lot of time has got to go by on looking at where we want to set up the 2017 program before we go too far down the road as to what we'd actually be spending."

Because it's -- one, it probably utilizes capabilities of the industry a little better, and it probably also ties into what we've already done over there. So there's a knowledge base that's already built. So I think it's kind of win-win on all fronts. No read-through to any different outlook, as far as all the potential customers. I'd say all the potential customers are still at the table, but it's just the recognition some things will come to place at different time periods. And as they do, it'll enable us to continue to move forward faster."

If you look at the Delek and Isramco guys did very successful financing on Tamar. On a project basis, those bonds actually got investment grade rating and continue to trade very well. So our sense is the bank market will be there. Our intent will be not to add new equity in from -- into Israel, but rather leverage the things that Dave talked about in terms of some partial monetization of assets. We just had -- realized $200 million from nonproducing assets there. And so, I think the financing will be either a project finance or an RBL type of financing. For our share, it will count as debt. If it's project financed, it still probably will be counted as debt, we'll think about it that way. And then we'll also try and leverage multilaterals or export credit agencies to help support the project, both financially and from a risk standpoint. So all that effort continues.

The term loan that we did was very advantageous, in that it's another synergy from ROSE and saving about $50 million of annual interest cost. But the other thing that was most attractive was it gave us the ability to potentially pay down some debt as we move forward.

292135,321989381,935047,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone.

For more than a decade now, Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment. I'm proud of what we've accomplished last year and I feel good about how we are positioned moving through this challenging time.  I'd like to start today's call with a few highlights wrapping up 2015, before focusing on our plans for 2016. 
Fourth quarter results show our continued operating momentum and focus on prudently managing within cash flow. For the second straight quarter, discretionary cash flow exceeded capital requirements -- capital expenditures. This reflects our asset quality, our portfolio diversity and the ability of our organization to execute. It's also a testament to the swift, decisive actions we took to reduce spending and drive capital efficiency beginning more than a year ago. 
          Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 422,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was above the high end of our increased guidance. This was driven by accelerated project start-ups in the Gulf of Mexico, strong asset performance in Equatorial Guinea and Israel, and continued improvement in completion design and infrastructure capacity in the DJ Basin. 
          Looking at our full year 2015 accomplishments, it was a year of outstanding operational and strategic execution under the backdrop of a difficult commodity environment. We began last year targeting increased production capacity from our DJ Basin asset, more recognition of the value in our Eastern Mediterranean projects and alignment with our Marcellus partner for future capital spend. By year's end, we had accomplished each of these objectives while transforming our cost structure to match the current environment. This was all achieved while realizing record safety performance across the business. 
          In addition, we took advantage of an opportunity to expand our leading U.S. unconventional portfolio with new top-tier positions in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Initial operating results have exceeded expectations and highlight Noble's technical proficiency with new completion designs and drilling efficiencies.
Our major project execution capabilities were again evident in 2015. We commenced production on both Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico, while keeping Gunflint and the Alba compression project on plan for 2016 start-up. In Israel, an approved and implemented natural gas regulatory framework gives us substantial momentum for future projects and the regulatory clarity necessary for new development to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas.
We ended 2015 with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which was up slightly versus year-end 2014. Excluding the impact of the Rosetta Resources merger and SEC commodity price changes, we replaced 1.5x 2015 production at a replacement cost of around $16 per barrel of oil equivalent.
Total organic capital for 2015 was under $2.9 billion, down approximately 40% from the previous year, while unit operating costs were driven to their lowest point in 8 years. At the same time, our average full year reported sales volumes were up nearly 20% over the year before. Part of the increase was the addition of the new Texas assets, but our legacy volumes grew more than 10% by themselves. 
          I would now like to take a few moments to describe how we're moving forward in the current environment. Noble Energy is an 84-year-old company. We've been through many cycles before. We believe our high-quality, low-cost and diversified portfolio, combined with capital discipline and tremendous investment flexibility, provides the best formula for long-term sustainable value creation. Look at 2015 and 2016. Without question, we're achieving more, while spending less. As I look across the E&P spectrum, I believe Noble Energy is competitively advantaged for the future.
Protecting the balance sheet is fundamental in this environment. That is why we are committed to managing total cash outflows within total cash inflows at the company level. We've started 2016 with $5 billion of liquidity, including $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. This liquidity has already been further bolstered this year by approximately $200 million in cash proceeds from nonproducing Eastern Mediterranean asset sales. An additional $200 million of capacity was created through the recent dividend adjustment and debt refinancing. We also intend to reduce leverage using additional cash flow from operations or portfolio proceeds beyond what has been captured to date.
Cash flow for the year is positively impacted by our hedging position, which covers approximately 35% of our global oil and 25% of our U.S. gas production. As we survey investment opportunities against the outlook for commodity prices, current returns do not justify prior activity levels. We're again pulling back capital aggressively in 2016 and focusing only in those areas where long-term value opportunities make sense.
We have further reduced our capital program by nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This will allow us to maintain financial strength and sustain underlying operating capabilities. As part of our intense scrutiny on capital allocation, our operating teams continue to improve capital efficiency, while ensuring that each dollar spent is justified by the future value created. This focus, along with our ability to monetize additional assets, gives us flexibility to adjust in a volatile price environment. 
          This year's program targets 2/3 of our capital to the U.S. unconventional business and 1/3 to development and exploration offshore. Gary will go through our detailed development programs in a moment, but first I want to briefly cover our exploration plans and production outlook for the year.
Our organic exploration strategy has generated substantial value and created long-term cash flows for Noble over the years. In 2016, we're focused on drilling 2 to 3 offshore wells, while obtaining and interpreting seismic to open up future value opportunities. We see this as a great environment to deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. 
          Now turning to production. In 2016, we expect to deliver volumes of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is up 10% on a full year reported basis and essentially flat to the pro forma 2015 level. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect the first and third quarters to be higher volume than the second and fourth, with the second half of the year generally equal to the first. We've had a strong start to the year, and I'm optimistic that we can drive new capital and operating efficiencies to outperform our goals. 
          In the slides for this conference call, we've provided detailed full year and first quarter guidance. First quarter volumes reflect downtime for the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. 
          I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham, who will review recent performance and the 2016 program at the asset level."

          I'll start our asset-level discussion with the DJ Basin. Fourth quarter total production of 121,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected continued improvement in completion performance and infrastructure development. The DJ Basin was, once again, a big contributor to the company's lower operating costs and production outperformance. Essentially all of the growth in the DJ versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 has come from liquids, with most of that, oil.
The December start-up of the Grand Parkway system further reduced line pressures to the lowest levels we can remember and should provide redundancy and improved throughput. Noble's operated Keota plant in East Pony, which came online mid-year 2015, is also running well, supporting our activity in that area. After drilling and completing horizontals in the DJ Basin for more than 5 years now, our team is still driving step changes in drilling results and well performance.
Our full year 2015 average drilling cost per lateral foot was down 40% from 2014. And as well costs have been substantially reduced, we've also enhanced production performance with optimized completion designs. We continue to focus on slickwater as our standard frac fluid design, which is consistently delivering lower costs and enhanced production per well.
The next step in completion, innovation and capital efficiency is utilizing a completion design that will allow slickwater fracs to be pumped to the tow [ph] on long laterals and also with higher proppant concentrations. Actual results on both hybrid gel and slickwater wells with higher proppant concentration are exhibiting better initial production and flatter declines compared to our historical jobs. 
          For 2016, we plan to operate 2 rigs for the full year, focusing in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. These are our highest-value IDPs, with strong oil contributions and existing infrastructure already in place. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is just under $600 billion. 70% of the DJ Basin wells to be drilled in 2016 are planned to be extended reach, many of which will be 9,000-foot laterals in Wells Ranch. We are targeting the drilling of 150 equivalent wells this year, and expect to commence production on slightly more than 200 equivalents.  While these lower activity levels suggest that DJ production will be down somewhat from last year, I'm optimistic that these new completion designs can help offset some of the potential declines. 
          Moving over to our Texas assets. I'm pleased with our integration efforts in 2015 and believe we're making good progress in optimizing the performance of these assets. During the fourth quarter, we started production on our first 5 Noble design completions in the Eagle Ford. And based on our review of public data, our first 3 design completions, which tested wider lateral spacing and higher profit concentrations, are among the most productive Eagle Ford wells ever completed.
We also announced 30-day results on 2 additional wells today. The average 30-day IP for these wells was over 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And this is remarkable, when you look on the fact that they were drilled by Rosetta on tighter 500-foot lateral spacing. Production from these 2 wells when normalized to a 5,000-foot lateral is also significantly above our 3 million-barrel EUR type curve, which is based on wider lateral spacing.
Capital allocation for the Texas assets is approximately $250 million. 60% is expected to be spent in the Eagle Ford, primarily to continue Gates Ranch development. The remaining 40% will be spent to begin our operated appraisal work in the Delaware Basin. Our first 2 completions in the Delaware are beginning production this month. And while we have pulled back capital in these assets from prior expectations, I still expect higher volumes in 2016 versus 2015 pro forma, driven mostly by the Eagle Ford.
In the Marcellus, total capital for this year is currently planned at $150 million. We've reduced activity to 0 drilling rigs with plans for the JV to be cash flow neutral. The focus will be on a limited number on completions in the non-operated dry gas area and will be weighted towards the first half of the year. As such, this is expected to deliver modestly higher volumes versus full year 2015.
The Gulf of Mexico finished the year strongly, with Big Bend and Dantzler starting production during the fourth quarter, ahead of schedule and on budget. Our Gulf of Mexico strategy of pursuing high-quality reservoirs near existing infrastructure generates substantial value. A full year of Big Bend and Dantzler, along with the Gunflint start-up, will contribute significant year-on-year oil volume growth during the coming year.
Noble's Gulf of Mexico budget is $250 million for 2016. As we complete the Gunflint project, the vast majority of capital will be for exploration and appraisal activities. The lineup includes the Silvergate prospect, which is currently drilling, and an appraisal well for our 2014 Katmai oil discovery. Silvergate is a Miocene target with a resource range between 30 and 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross, with nearby subsea tieback potential, and results are expected by the end of the first quarter.
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged to 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 9% from the same period last year, mainly due to robust power generation demand. Strong natural gas demand is continuing into 2016, not only from this year's early cold weather, but also from the expanded use of natural gas over other power generation source fuels. In 2016, we have included approximately $100 million for pre-FID capital expenditures on our Eastern Mediterranean projects. The region is fundamentally short gas and we'll focus this year on finalizing gas sales agreements within Israel and with multiple regional customers.
As we progress the technical and commercial readiness of our projects, we are operating with the following principles: First and foremost, ensure that our development concepts match market demand; second, we remain focused on meeting and growing demand for natural gas within Israel, while diversifying our regional market opportunities; and third, we are managing project risk through financing, including the potential involvement of international financial institutions. 
          I'd now like to take a couple of minutes and provide an update on our current thinking about the Leviathan development. Along with our FPSO development concept, we are also progressing another design that utilizes a fixed platform to ensure timely first production. The initial development under this fixed platform concept would be anchored by Israeli domestic demand, Jordan power needs and Egyptian industrial demand. While continuing to refine the technical requirements, initial capacity could start at over 1 BCF, billion cubic feet, of gas per day, and is quickly expandable to more than 2 BCF a day. This option provides the most flexibility to match contracted volumes with accelerated development, while retaining the capability to meet existing and growing demand.
As you would expect, preproduction capital outlays can be substantially reduced by this design modification, along with the current service cost environment. This will all be firmed up as we move through 2016 securing necessary gas contracts, recosting the final technical project and finalizing project financing to move forward to FID. Additionally, we continue to work with LNG plant owners in the region to secure gas contracts. The combination of our high-quality Eastern Mediterranean reservoirs with idle LNG plants positions us well to be competitive in the global LNG world. 
          Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks."

As you look beyond '16 into 2017, you have to look at the pieces of the portfolio and kind of just think through each one of those and how they are impacted. The Eastern Med, for example, it's going to be flat to up depending on demand. In the Gulf of Mexico, we should see some improvement in '17 versus '16 because you're bringing Isabela back on. We've got an Isabela workover here in the first quarter impacting '16. We'll bring that back on, so you'll have the impact of Isabela, and then you'll have a full year of Gunflint in '17. West Africa, you'll have the full year of Alba, which has been impacted this year, in '16, by the downtime on putting the compression project in. That should offset decline on Aseng and Alen. So West Africa should be flat to potentially up. So the international offshore portfolio will give you good sustenance, if you will, underlying the production basin. Then in the U.S, I would assume the Texas properties will continue to grow in '17. And then at the current-type investment levels, you could see some decline in the Marcellus and the DJ. But when you think about '17 overall, the way I think about it, at kind of the 2016 spending level, you'd probably remain fairly flat. But I think a lot of work and a lot of time has got to go by on looking at where we want to set up the 2017 program before we go too far down the road as to what we'd actually be spending."

We've continued, all throughout the last year, to keep the banking sector warm on Leviathan financing, and we still see that there. If you look at the Delek and Isramco guys did very successful financing on Tamar. On a project basis, those bonds actually got investment grade rating and continue to trade very well. So our sense is the bank market will be there. Our intent will be not to add new equity in from -- into Israel, but rather leverage the things that Dave talked about in terms of some partial monetization of assets. We just had -- realized $200 million from nonproducing assets there. And so, I think the financing will be either a project finance or an RBL type of financing. For our share, it will count as debt. If it's project financed, it still probably will be counted as debt, we'll think about it that way. And then we'll also try and leverage multilaterals or export credit agencies to help support the project, both financially and from a risk standpoint. So all that effort continues. And so I don't see it as a pacing item to enable sanction."

And then if we have some portfolio proceeds, we'll certainly have -- take a look at that in the context of delevering, as Dave mentioned. The term loan that we did was very advantageous, in that it's another synergy from ROSE and saving about $50 million of annual interest cost. But the other thing that was most attractive was it gave us the ability to potentially pay down some debt as we move forward. All of our debt to date had been bond debt, which had some friction involved in any prepayment, this gives us full flexibility. So that's how we'll manage going forward.

If you've had a chance to look at our earnings release and conference call slides this morning, I think you'll agree that we had a tremendous operating quarter and a very solid start to 2016. We began the year with these key goals: Protect the balance sheet; align cash outflows with cash inflows; leverage the benefits of our diversified portfolio; and optimize returns with enhanced completion. First quarter results show we are delivering on each of these objectives. 
Before going into our results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the current environment. With the U.S. rig count at a record low, significantly lower investment is translating into production declines in the majority of unconventional basins. It is my hope that we will continue to see capital discipline throughout the industry regarding activity levels. Even if we see sustained higher commodity prices, any meaningful U.S. production impact from increased industry activity is likely to take several months from initial investment decisions. 
Outside North America, non-OPEC major project deferrals are beginning to add up to at least a few million barrels per day through 2020. While there have been early indications of a potential commodity price turn, I expect commodities will continue to show volatility day-to-day and week-to-week. Regardless, no matter what commodity environment persist, it is clear to me Noble Energy is well positioned to sustain and create long-term value for its shareholders. 
Moving to our results. We continue to lower both our capital and underlying cost structure in the first quarter. This was primarily the result of impressive and sustainable and efficiency gains in our U.S. onshore business. Capital expenditures were below the low end of our guidance, and decreased for a sixth consecutive quarter as we manage within cash flow. We came in well below guidance on most of our key cost metrics. Total lease operating expense and general administrative cost in the first quarter of 2016, which included Rosetta, were flat in an absolute amount compared to a Noble in [indiscernible] of first quarter 2015. This is a powerful indication of our cost-reduction efforts when you consider the company added almost 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that same period. Excluding the [indiscernible] workover, unit lease operating expense was down 34% from the first quarter of last year. At the same time, we exceeded the high end of our volume guidance with 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in the first quarter. This is up more than 30% in total and 8% pro forma for the Rosetta merger versus the same quarter last year. Compared to guidance, oil was higher, NGLs were higher, and so was gas. This was achieved by impressive productivity improvements in the U.S. with new completions, record first quarter sales volumes in Israel and reduced downtime at Alba and Equatorial Guinea. In fact, every core area is delivering or exceeding our plans so far in 2016. 
Executions stood out in the DJ Basin position where completion optimization and longer laterals drove 34% growth in Wells Ranch and East Pony production compared to the same quarter of last year. And in the Delaware Basin, where we're just getting started, third-party analysis of state data indicate Noble Energy has the highest productivity per lateral foot in the basin this year. 
Equally as important, we maintained our robust financial position, ending the quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. Since quarter end, we have executed asset sales transactions totaling nearly $550 million, including the transaction announced yesterday. Combined with first quarter proceeds received, we will have generated total proceeds of over $775 million so far in 2016. The Greeley Crescent [ph] transaction significantly accelerates the value of this acreage for Noble Energy. It is an area that would not have been developed for some time as we are currently focused on higher value areas within the DJ Basin. Gary will talk more about this shortly. 
Our continued focus on discipline capital allocation and prudent balance sheet management did not go unnoticed by the rating agencies. We not only maintained our investment grade ratings at Moody's and S&P, but received initial investment grade ratings from Fitch as well. Ken and the treasury team did a great job continuing engagement with the rating agencies, and I believe we are 1 of only 4 of our peers with investment grade ratings across the board. 
Our strong underlying performance, the recent upward move in commodity prices and announced proceeds from asset sales position us to generate significant excess cash in 2016 and give us more flexibility for the future. 
At current prices, we continue to be focused on balance sheet strength and the opportunity to pay down debt. As commodity prices moves and sustain above $50 per barrel, we will begin to consider additional capital allocation to the U.S. unconventional business, with initial focus on our low-cost and liquids-rich assets in the DJ Basin in Texas. 
We've continued the trend of improving our performance in the first quarter, and I'm confident there is much more to come. I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham."

As Dave mentioned, we continue with very high levels of operating momentum in the early part of the year, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. The level of engagement by our entire organization to continuous",1059,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we continue with very high levels of operating momentum in the early part of the year, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. The level of engagement by our entire organization to continuously drive efficiencies throughout the business is certainly apparent, and realized drilling time reductions and enhanced productivity in all of our reasons. 
The DJ Basin, once again, delivered production outperformance at lower costs. First quarter production totaled 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, we reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well cost to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch, down 35% from the first quarter of 2015, despite utilizing higher profit concentrations. This decrease is a result of intense focus on drilling and completion execution and utilizing the best rigs and the best crudes in the basin. 
We continue to shift our well design to include more model board drilling, which provides many benefits, particularly for the combination of longer laterals and slickwater fracs. On the first 35 model board wells we drilled, we're observing reduced drill times of 1.5 to 2.5 days or 30%, the ability to eliminate gel and [indiscernible] in the long laterals, and finally, the model board also provides more options for future well innovations. 
Completion design continues to evolve rapidly, and it's paying off an impressive well productivity. You can see on Slide 5 the average IP-30 rate per lateral foot was up more than 30% from the same period a year ago, and the liquids content of the wells, which came online in 2016, is higher than in prior years. This productivity improvement reflects both the shift of slickwater fluids as well as enhanced profit loading. Both Noble Energy and third-party infrastructure have been performing well keeping line pressure low throughout the field. Our plant turnaround and our Wells Ranch processing facility was completed in April. This was part of routine maintenance and is the first as the facility start up 3 years ago. 
Yesterday, we announced the transaction to sell approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area, which is located on the western side of our DJ acreage position. Representing about half of our acreage in Greeley Crescent, the transaction accelerates the value of Noble Energy from an area which was not in our development plan for many years. Our strategy is to focus on areas with higher oil content where we have more contiguous acres and drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. Greeley Crescent is [indiscernible] with very little production as horizontal drilling industry and the transaction highlights the strong value of undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin. Total proceeds are expected to be $505 million. 
In Texas, we continue to deliver results that confirm our high quality positions in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Drilling times were down 20% from prior performance on these assets, and we announced several exciting well results this morning. Results from our first 2 Delaware completions in Reeves County were impressive. The average IP-30 rate of over 320 barrels of oil equivalent per 1,000 lateral feet is nearly 15% better than the prior average on these assets. 
I want to turn your attention to Slide 7, which provides more details. The first will validate our Tier 1 Wolfcamp A position across the eastern and western extent of the acreage. The Calamity Jane well is performing significantly above Noble's 700,000 type curve, with oil production in line and gas showing material outperformance. We're also pleased to see our western extension test, the Soapy Smith well, performing consistent with the Tier 1 type curve. These outstanding results right out of the gate demonstrate the transferability of our U.S. onshore completion expertise, and we'll continue to delineate the acreage position while further optimizing completions this year. 
In the Eagle Ford, we're seeing early success bringing our improved completion designs from South Gates Ranch to new areas, unlocking additional resource potential. As Slide 8 indicates, the 2 Briscoe Ranch well fall under in the quarter are materially outperforming the 400,000-barrel type curves you can see on the chart. In fact, they're actually outperforming even 1 million-barrel type curve. These wells are an average lateral length of 4,900 feet and were completed with 2,000 pounds of profit per lateral foot. The better performing well is designed with tighter cluster spacing. In March, we brought 6 online 6 Gates Ranch wells which tested various spacing and completion concepts. We're just now seeing production post cleanup, and these wells will drive significant volume growth in Texas during the second quarter. 
In the Marcellus, exceptional operating performance continues to ensure deliverability of base production. We remain well aligned with our partner to be cash flow neutral in the joint venture in 2016 and we'll continue to be flexible with completion activity for the remainder of the year. 
We started the year strongly in the Gulf of Mexico, with Big Bend and Dantzler contributing 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Noble Energy during the quarter. This drove Gulf of Mexico oil volumes up almost 100% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the Isabella workover was completed ahead of schedule, and Gunflint continues to progress toward the mid-year 2016 start-up. 
We recently commenced drilling in appraisal well at Katmai. This well will test resource upside to the 40 million to 60 million barrels of oil equivalent already discovered. And we anticipate results early in the fourth quarter. 
Sales volumes in West Africa averaged 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong underlying performance at [indiscernible] continued during the quarter. And in Alba, installation of the new D3 compression platform was carried out with fewer downtime days than expected. Commissioning and start-up of the compression platform, which will enhance full field recovery remains on schedule for mid-year. 
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged to 266 million cubic feet of gas per day. This represents an increase of nearly 10% from the same period last year despite mild weather experienced thus far in 2016. With the Israeli government's mandate to reduce coal-fired generation by 15% year-over-year, we've seen consistent incremental coal-to-gas switching on the order of 50 million cubic feet per day gross with potential upside to that number. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before providing details on our adjusted guidance, I'd like to take a moment to provide a further update on our Israel projects. Tamar's production growth, resilient cash flows and access to significantly undersupplied markets make it one of the most attractive assets in the world. Leviathan is the same quality asset, on an even larger scale with a total recoverable resource of 22 trillion cubic feet of gas based on multiple appraisal wells drilled and a production test as well. 
In late March, Israel's Supreme Court acknowledged the strategic and national importance of these discoveries by upholding all but one of the provisions of the natural gas framework. The court recognized the important of stabilization but rejected the specific provision in the framework. We are engaged with the government as it works to timely address the Supreme Court's concern. 
In the meantime, we continue to progress the other 3 critical requirements for Leviathan sanction: Financing, marketing and technical readiness. We are pleased that the Israeli National Planning Committee recently approved the location of the Leviathan platform and pipeline connection in northern Israel. I am convinced that the Leviathan, along with Tamar, will supply much-needed gas for both Israel and the neighboring region for decades. 
We've provided a full update to our 2016 guidance on Slide 11. Normally, I wouldn't change our outlooks so early in the year, but this reflects the high level of confidence I have in our strategy, assets, execution and ultimately, our future. 
Full year sales are now expected to average 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4% from original guidance, with increased expectations for all 3 commodities. The production raise is based primarily on outperformance in the DJ Basin, Israel and West Africa. 
And on the capital side, we are trending on a path to come in under $1.5 billion. 
For the second quarter, capital is affected to be in line with the first quarter. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Volumes are expected to be impacted by seasonality in Israel and facility turnaround in the DJ Basin. This will be partially offset by significant quarter-over-quarter growth in Texas. We also expect higher volumes in West Africa as a result of Alba field production returning to full rate. 
In summary, I continue to be pleased with the capital efficiencies generated across the business. Our financial strengths, asset quality and onshore and offshore expertise give us a unique competitive advantage in any commodity environment. 
At this time, Levi, why don't we go ahead and open the call to questions."

I'd say when we look at things in general, and if it goes back to kind of what our philosophy has been as we always look at all parts of our portfolio. More value at somebody else, then we're going to do that. If there's some reason that it can -- we can realize more value from it by moving it to somebody else's hand, we'll look at that. I think as we look at the year and what we've talked about previously, the one place were Noble continue to look at potential monetization of a portion of our business is over in Israel with Tamar, for example. We've talked about this as part of the framework that in over 6 years, we look to bring down our interest from 36% to 25%. I'd say in the current environment, there's still a lot of interest and other folks wanting to get into that field. So there could be a possibility. We might bring down some of our interest this year, but it's too early to say. So I would say that the main one we're continuing to stay focus on. Outside of that, we still have a big midstream business that we kept that one active. And at some point in time, I think we'll see some real value, additional value come out of that part of the business. That's kind of how I think about that portfolio. Most of it's all cord, up, we don't have a lot of fringe pieces. But as in the case of this opportunity, if it makes sense to accelerate value, we'll look at it."

So it just goes to show why over the last couple of years, we've really been talking a lot about refocusing activity in the best of the best, which is the higher oil content areas, Wells Ranch and East Pony.

Slickwater is certainly have been a driver of it as well, moving to monobore drilling helps by taking a day, sometimes more than that off so the wells as well. So and then in Wells Ranch and East Pony where we've got existing infrastructure and the ability to drill those long laterals, which can drive your average cost per foot down as well, will certainly no doubt that we have some things that are offsetting that was removing the higher and higher sand concentrations and testing some tighter spacing in some areas. But the good news is we been able to deliver an up efficiencies and all the other areas to more than offset that and continue to drive cost down. As I mentioned in the press release, were down to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch on our extended reach well, adjusted back to a normal lateral link. And that's with some of the impact of the higher completion cost from the higher sand loading. If you go back to more of a traditional type completion design that we might have had in the past, those costs are down more to the $2.4 million range. So great job by the teams and continuing to execute and look for efficiencies."

I think the interesting thing about the Soapy Smith is even though it's outperforming the type curve, not as much as the Calamity Jane is, but that's outperforming the type curve, it's significantly outperforming, I think, some of historical wells in that area by as much as 20% or 30%. And so that's the well we did the slickwater test on. It's really the only well that we've done a slickwater test on in that area.

If you've had a chance to look at our earnings release and conference call slides this morning, I think you'll agree that we had a tremendous operating quarter and a very solid start to 2016. We began the year w",852,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. 
If you've had a chance to look at our earnings release and conference call slides this morning, I think you'll agree that we had a tremendous operating quarter and a very solid start to 2016. We began the year with these key goals: protect the balance sheet; align cash outflows with cash inflows; leverage the benefits of our diversified portfolio; and optimize returns with enhanced completions. First quarter results show we are delivering on each of these objectives. 
Before going into our results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the current environment. With the U.S. rig count at a record low, significantly lower investment is translating into production declines in the majority of unconventional basins. It is my hope that we will continue to see capital discipline throughout the industry regarding activity levels. Even if we see sustained higher commodity prices, any meaningful U.S. production impact from increased industry activity is likely to take several months from initial investment decisions. 
Outside North America, non-OPEC major project deferrals are beginning to add up to at least a few million barrels per day through 2020. While there have been early indications of a potential commodity price turn, I expect commodities will continue to show volatility day-to-day and week-to-week. Regardless, no matter what commodity environment persist, it is clear to me Noble Energy is well positioned to sustain and create long-term value for its shareholders. 
Moving to our results. We continue to lower both our capital and underlying cost structure in the first quarter. This was primarily the result of impressive and sustainable efficiency gains in our U.S. onshore business. Capital expenditures were below the low end of our guidance and decreased for a sixth consecutive quarter as we manage within cash flow. We came in well below guidance on most of our key cost metrics. Total lease operating expense and general and administrative cost in the first quarter of 2016, which included Rosetta, were flat in an absolute amount compared to a Noble-only first quarter of 2015. This is a powerful indication of our cost-reduction efforts when you consider the company added almost 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that same period. 
Excluding the Isabela workover, unit lease operating expense was down 34% from the first quarter of last year. At the same time, we exceeded the high end of our volume guidance with 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in the first quarter. This is up more than 30% in total and 8% pro forma for the Rosetta merger versus the same quarter last year. 
Compared to guidance, oil was higher, NGLs were higher and so was gas. This was achieved by impressive productivity improvements in the U.S. with new completions, record first quarter sales volumes in Israel and reduced downtime at Alba in Equatorial Guinea. In fact, every core area is delivering or exceeding our plans so far in 2016. 
Executions stood out in the DJ Basin position where completion optimization and longer laterals drove 34% growth in Wells Ranch and East Pony production compared to the same quarter of last year. And in the Delaware Basin, where we're just getting started, third-party analysis of state data indicates Noble Energy has the highest productivity per lateral foot in the basin this year. 
Equally as important, we maintained our robust financial position, ending the quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. Since quarter end, we have executed asset sales transactions totaling nearly $550 million, including the transaction announced yesterday. Combined with first quarter proceeds received, we will have generated total proceeds of over $775 million so far in 2016. 
The Greeley Crescent transaction significantly accelerates the value of this acreage for Noble Energy. It is an area that would not have been developed for some time as we are currently focused on higher value areas within the DJ Basin. Gary will talk more about this shortly. 
 
Our continuous focus on disciplined capital allocation and prudent balance sheet management did not go unnoticed by the rating agencies. We not only maintained our investment-grade ratings at Moody's and S&P, but received an initial investment-grade rating from Fitch as well. Ken and the treasury team do a great job continuing engagement with the rating agencies, and I believe we are 1 of only 4 of our peers with investment-grade ratings across the board. 
Our strong underlying performance, the recent upward move in commodity prices and announced proceeds from asset sales position us to generate significant excess cash in 2016 and give us more flexibility for the future. 
 
At current prices, we continue to be focused on balance sheet strength and the opportunity to pay down debt. As commodity prices move and sustain above $50 per barrel, we will begin to consider additional capital allocation to the U.S. unconventional business, with initial focus on our low-cost and liquid-rich assets in the DJ Basin in Texas. 
 
We've continued the trend of improving our performance in the first quarter, and I'm confident there is much more to come. I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham."

As Dave mentioned, we've continued with very high levels of operating momentum in the early part of the year, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. The level of engagement by our entire organization to continuously drive efficiencies throughout the business is certainly apparent, and realized drilling time reductions and enhanced productivity in all of our reasons. 
The DJ Basin, once again, delivered production outperformance at lower costs. First quarter production totaled 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, we reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well cost to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch, down 35% from the first quarter of 2015 despite utilizing higher profit concentrations. This decrease is the result of intense focus on drilling and completion execution, and utilizing the best rigs and the best crews in the basin. 
We continue to shift our well design to include more monobore  drilling, which provides many benefits, particularly for the combination of longer laterals and slickwater fracs. On the first 35 monobore  wells we've drilled, we're observing reduced drill times of 1.5 to 2.5 days or 30%, the ability to eliminate gel and tow stages in the long laterals. And finally, the monobore  also provides more options for future well innovations. 
Completion design continues to evolve rapidly, and it's paying off an impressive well productivity. You can see on Slide 5 the average IP-30 rate per lateral foot was up more than 30% from the same period a year ago, and the liquids content of the well, which came online in 2016, is higher than in prior years. This productivity improvement reflects both the shift to slickwater fluid as well as enhanced proppant loading. 
Both Noble Energy's and third-party infrastructure have been performing well, keeping line pressures low throughout the field. A planned turnaround at our Wells Ranch central processing facility was completed in April. This was part of routine maintenance and is the first as the facility start up 3 years ago. 
Yesterday, we announced the transaction to sell approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area, which is located on the western side of our DJ acreage position. Representing about half of our acreage in Greeley Crescent, the transaction accelerates the value to Noble Energy from an area, which was not in our development plan for many years. Our strategy is to focus on areas with higher oil content where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. Greeley Crescent is an area with very little production in horizontal drilling history, and the transaction highlights the strong value of undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin. Total proceeds are expected to be $505 million. 
 
In Texas, we continue to deliver results that confirm our high quality positions in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Drilling times are down 20% from prior performance on these assets, and we announced several exciting well results this morning. Results from our first 2 Delaware completions in Reeves County are impressive. The average IP-30 rate of over 320 barrels of oil equivalent per 1,000 lateral feet is nearly 15% better than the prior average on these assets. 
I want to turn your attention to Slide 7, which provides more details. These first wells validate our Tier 1 Wolfcamp A position across the eastern and western extent of the acreage. The Calamity Jane well in the east is performing significantly above Noble's 700,000-barrel type curve, with oil production in line and gas showing material outperformance. We are also pleased to see our western extension test, the Soapy Smith well, performing consistent with the Tier 1 type curve. These outstanding results right out of the gate demonstrate the transferability of our U.S. onshore completion expertise, and we will continue to delineate the acreage position while further optimizing completions this year. 
 
In the Eagle Ford, we're seeing early success bringing our improved completion designs from South Gates Ranch to new areas, unlocking additional resource potential. As Slide 8 indicates, the 2 Briscoe Ranch wells brought on during the quarter are materially outperforming the 400,000-barrel type curve you can see on the chart. In fact, they're actually outperforming even 1 million-barrel type curve. These wells have an average lateral length of 4,900 feet and were completed with 2,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot. The better performing well was designed with tighter cluster spacing. In March, we brought 6 -- online 6 Gates Ranch wells which tested various spacing and completion concepts. We're just now seeing production post-cleanup, and these wells will drive significant volume growth in Texas during the second quarter. 
In the Marcellus, exceptional operational performance continues to ensure deliverability of base production. We remain well aligned with our partner to be cash flow neutral in the joint venture in 2016 and we'll continue to be flexible with completion activity for the remainder of the year. 
 
We started the year strongly in the Gulf of Mexico, with Big Bend and Dantzler contributing 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Noble Energy during the quarter. This drove Gulf of Mexico oil volumes up almost 100% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the Isabela workover was completed ahead of schedule, and Gunflint continues to progress toward the mid-year 2016 start-up. 
We recently commenced drilling an appraisal well at Katmai. This well will test resource upside to the 40 million to 60 million barrels of oil equivalent already discovered, and we anticipate results early in the fourth quarter. 
 
Sales volumes in West Africa averaged 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong underlying performance at Aseng and Alen continued during the quarter. And at Alba, installation of the new B3 compression platform was carried out with fewer downtime days than expected. Commissioning and start-up of the compression platform, which will enhance full field recovery, remains on schedule for mid-year. 
 
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged to 266 million cubic feet of gas per day. This represents an increase of nearly 10% from the same period last year despite mild weather experienced thus far in 2016. With the Israeli government's mandate to reduce coal-fired generation by 15% year-over-year, we've seen consistent incremental coal-to-gas switching on the order of 50 million cubic feet per day gross with potential upside to that number. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before providing details on our adjusted guidance, I'd like to take a moment to provide a further update on our Israel projects.

Before providing details on our adjusted guidance, I'd like to take a moment to provide a further update on our Israel projects. Tamar's production growth, resilient cash flows and access to significantly undersupplied markets make it one of the most attractive assets in the world. Leviathan is the same quality asset, on an even larger scale with a total recoverable resource of 22 trillion cubic feet of gas based on multiple appraisal wells drilled and a production test as well. 
 
In late March, Israel's Supreme Court acknowledged the strategic and national importance of these discoveries by upholding all but one of the provisions of the natural gas framework. The court recognized the importance of stabilization but rejected the specific provision in the framework. We are engaged with the government as it works to timely address the Supreme Court's concern. 
In the meantime, we continue to progress the other 3 critical requirements for a Leviathan sanction: financing, marketing and technical readiness. We are pleased that the Israeli National Planning Committee recently approved the location of the Leviathan platform and pipeline connection in northern Israel. I am convinced that Leviathan, along with Tamar, will supply much-needed gas for both Israel and the neighboring region for decades. 
We've provided a full update to our 2016 guidance on Slide 11. Normally, I wouldn't change our outlook so early in the year. But this reflects the high level of confidence I have in our strategy, assets, execution and ultimately, our future.   
Full year sales are now expected to average 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4% from original guidance, with increased expectations for all 3 commodities. The production raise is based primarily on outperformance in the DJ Basin, Israel and West Africa. And on the capital side, we are trending on a path to come in under $1.5 billion. 
For the second quarter, capital is affected to be in line with the first quarter. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Volumes are expected to be impacted by seasonality in Israel and facility turnaround in the DJ Basin. This will be partially offset by significant quarter-over-quarter growth in Texas. We also expect higher volumes in West Africa as a result of Alba field production returning to full rate. 
In summary, I continue to be pleased with the capital efficiencies generated across the business. Our financial strengths, asset quality and onshore and offshore expertise give us a unique competitive advantage in any commodity environment. 
 
At this time, Levi, why don't we go ahead and open the call to questions?"

It was something in our plans we weren't going to be developing for a while, given where it fit in the portfolio, so it made sense to move forward. I'd say when we look at things in general, and it goes back to kind of what our philosophy has been as we've always looked at all parts of our portfolio. If we can create more value out of it than somebody else, then we're going to do that. If there's some reason that it can -- we can realize more value from it by moving it to somebody else's hands, we'll look at that. I think as we look at the year and what we've talked about previously, the one place were Noble continued to look at potential monetization of a portion of our business is over in Israel with Tamar, for example. We've talked about as part of the framework that in over 6 years, we'll look to bring down our interest from 36% to 25%. I'd say in the current environment, there's still a lot of interest in other folks wanting to get into that field. So there could be a possibility. We might bring down some of our interest this year, but it's too early to say. So I would say that the main one we're continuing to stay focus on. Outside of that, we still have a big midstream business that we kept that S-1 active. And at some point in time, I think we'll see some real value -- additional value come out of that part of the business, but that's kind of how I think about that portfolio. Most of it's all cord up, we don't have a lot of fringe pieces. But as in the case of this opportunity, if it makes sense to accelerate value, we'll look at it."

You still have the drive and the push from customers in Egypt to get gas, interruptible gas, as soon as that can be worked out.

East Pony is, by far, the highest oil percentage acreage that we have in our portfolio, and that's were a large number of the wells that we're bringing on early part of this year were from. So that's probably driving that percentage up."

I mean, you certainly see it in the continuing improvement in the drilling performance where we continue to set records on a fairly consistent basis, taking a little bit of time off here and there of our previous records on drilling times. Slickwater is certainly -- have been a driver of it as well, moving to monobore drilling has helped by taking a day, sometimes more than that, off of the wells as well. So -- and then in Wells Ranch and East Pony, where we've got existing infrastructure and the ability to drill those long laterals, which can drive your average cost per foot down as well, certainly helped out. So do have some things that are offsetting that as we're moving to higher and higher sand concentrations and testing some tighter spacing in some areas, but the good news is we've been able to deliver enough efficiencies in all the other areas to more than offset that and continue to drive cost down. As we mentioned in the press release, we're down to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch on an extended reach well, adjusted back to a normal lateral length. And that's with some of the impact of the higher completion cost from the higher sand loading. If you go back to more of a traditional type completion design that we might have had in the past, those costs are down more to the $2.4 million range. So great job by the teams and continuing to execute and look for efficiencies."

I think the interesting thing about the Soapy Smith is even though it's outperforming the type curve, not as much as the Calamity Jane is, but it's outperforming the type curve, it's significantly outperforming, I think, some of historical wells in that area by as much as 20% or 30%. And so that's the well we did the slickwater test on. It's really the only well that we've done a slickwater test on in that area.

We began the year w",854,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. 
If you've had a chance to look at our earnings release and conference call slides this morning, I think you'll agree that we had a tremendous operating quarter and a very solid start to 2016. We began the year with these key goals: protect the balance sheet; align cash outflows with cash inflows; leverage the benefits of our diversified portfolio; and optimize returns with enhanced completions. First quarter results show we are delivering on each of these objectives. 
Before going into our results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the current environment. With the U.S. rig count [ph] at a record low, significantly lower investment is translating into production declines in the majority of unconventional basins. It is my hope that we will continue to see capital discipline throughout the industry regarding activity levels. Even if we see sustained higher commodity prices, any meaningful U.S. production impact from increased industry activity is likely to take several months from initial investment decisions. 
Outside North America, non-OPEC major project deferrals are beginning to add up to at least a few million barrels per day through 2020. While there have been early indications of a potential commodity price turn, I expect commodities will continue to show volatility day-to-day and week-to-week. Regardless, no matter what commodity environment persists, it is clear to me Noble Energy is well positioned to sustain and create long-term value for its shareholders. 
Moving to our results. We continue to lower both our capital and underlying cost structure in the first quarter. This was primarily the result of impressive and sustainable efficiency gains in our U.S. onshore business. Capital expenditures were below the low end of our guidance and decreased for a sixth consecutive quarter as we managed within cash flow. We came in well below guidance on most of our key cost metrics. Total lease operating expense and general and administrative cost in the first quarter of 2016, which included Rosetta, were flat in an absolute amount compared to a Noble-only first quarter of 2015. This is a powerful indication of our cost-reduction efforts when you consider the company added almost 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that same period. 
Excluding the Isabela workover, unit lease operating expense was down 34% from the first quarter of last year. At the same time, we exceeded the high end of our volume guidance with 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in the first quarter. This is up more than 30% in total and 8% pro forma for the Rosetta merger versus the same quarter of last year. 
Compared to guidance, oil was higher, NGLs were higher and so was gas. This was achieved by impressive productivity improvements in the U.S. with new completions, record first quarter sales volumes in Israel and reduced downtime at Alba in Equatorial Guinea. In fact, every core area is delivering or exceeding our plans so far in 2016. 
Executions stood out in the DJ Basin position where completion optimization and longer laterals drove 34% growth in Wells Ranch and East Pony production compared to the same quarter of last year. And in the Delaware Basin, where we're just getting started, third-party analysis of state data indicates Noble Energy has the highest productivity per lateral foot in the basin this year. 
Equally as important, we maintained our robust financial position, ending the quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. Since quarter end, we have executed asset sales transactions totaling nearly $550 million, including the transaction announced yesterday. Combined with first quarter proceeds received, we will have generated total proceeds of over $775 million so far in 2016. 
The Greeley Crescent transaction significantly accelerates the value of this acreage for Noble Energy. It is an area that would not have been developed for some time as we are currently focused on higher value areas within the DJ Basin. Gary will talk more about this shortly. 
 
Our continuous focus on disciplined capital allocation and prudent balance sheet management did not go unnoticed by the rating agencies. We not only maintained our investment-grade ratings at Moody's and S&P, but received an initial investment-grade rating from Fitch as well. Ken and the treasury team do a great job continuing engagement with the rating agencies, and I believe we are 1 of only 4 of our peers with investment-grade ratings across the board. 
Our strong underlying performance, the recent upward move in commodity prices and announced proceeds from asset sales, position us to generate significant excess cash in 2016 and give us more flexibility for the future. 
 
At current prices, we continue to be focused on balance sheet strength and the opportunity to pay down debt. As commodity prices move and sustain above $50 per barrel, we will begin to consider additional capital allocation to the U.S. unconventional business, with initial focus on our low-cost and liquid-rich assets in the DJ Basin in Texas. 
 
We've continued the trend of improving our performance in the first quarter, and I'm confident there is much more to come. I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham."

As Dave mentioned, we've continued with very high levels of operating momentum in the early part of the year, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. The level of engagement by our entire organization to continuously drive efficiencies throughout the business is certainly apparent, and realized drilling time reductions and enhanced productivity in all of our reasons. 
The DJ Basin, once again, delivered production outperformance at lower costs. First quarter production totaled 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, we reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well costs to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch, down 35% from the first quarter of 2015 despite utilizing higher profit concentrations. This decrease is the result of intense focus on drilling and completion execution, and utilizing the best rigs and the best crews in the basin. 
We continue to shift our well design to include more monobore drilling, which provides many benefits, particularly for the combination of longer laterals and slickwater fracs. On the first 35 monobore  wells we've drilled, we're observing reduced drill times of 1.5 to 2.5 days or 30%, the ability to eliminate gel and tow stages [ph] in the long laterals. And finally, the monobore also provides more options for future well innovations. 
Completion design continues to evolve rapidly, and it's paying off an impressive well productivity. You can see on Slide 5 the average IP-30 rate per lateral foot was up more than 30% from the same period a year ago, and the liquids content of the well, which came online in 2016, is higher than in prior years. This productivity improvement reflects both a shift to slickwater fluid as well as enhanced proppant loading. 
Both Noble Energy's and third-party infrastructure have been performing well, keeping line pressures low throughout the field. A planned turnaround at our Wells Ranch central processing facility was completed in April. This was part of routine maintenance and is the first as the facility start up 3 years ago. 
Yesterday, we announced the transaction to sell approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area, which is located on the western side of our DJ acreage position. Representing about half of our acreage in Greeley Crescent, the transaction accelerates the value to Noble Energy from an area which was not in our development plan for many years. Our strategy is to focus on areas with higher oil content where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. Greeley Crescent is an area with very little production in horizontal drilling history, and the transaction highlights the strong value of undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin. Total proceeds are expected to be $505 million. 
 
In Texas, we continue to deliver results that confirm our high quality positions in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Drilling times are down 20% from prior performance on these assets, and we announced several exciting well results this morning. Results from our first 2 Delaware completions in Reeves County are impressive. The average IP-30 rate of over 320 barrels of oil equivalent per 1,000 lateral feet is nearly 15% better than the prior average on these assets. 
I want to turn your attention to Slide 7, which provides more details. These first wells validate our Tier 1 Wolfcamp A position across the eastern and western extent of the acreage. The Calamity Jane well in the east is performing significantly above Noble's 700,000-barrel type curve, with oil production in line and gas showing material outperformance. We are also pleased to see our western extension test, the Soapy Smith well, performing consistent with the Tier 1 type curve. These outstanding results right out of the gate demonstrate the transferability of our U.S. onshore completion expertise, and we will continue to delineate the acreage position while further optimizing completions this year. 
 
In the Eagle Ford, we're seeing early success bringing our improved completion designs from South Gates Ranch to new areas, unlocking additional resource potential. As Slide 8 indicates, the 2 Briscoe Ranch wells brought on during the quarter are materially outperforming the 400,000-barrel type curve you can see on the chart. In fact, they're actually outperforming even a 1 million-barrel type curve. These wells have an average lateral length of 4,900 feet and were completed with 2,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot. The better performing well was designed with tighter cluster spacing. In March, we brought 6 -- online 6 Gates Ranch wells which tested various spacing and completion concepts. We're just now seeing production post-cleanup, and these wells will drive significant volume growth in Texas during the second quarter. 
In the Marcellus, exceptional operational performance continues to ensure deliverability of base production. We remain well aligned with our partner to be cash flow neutral in the joint venture in 2016 and we'll continue to be flexible with completion activity for the remainder of the year. 
 
We started the year strongly in the Gulf of Mexico, with Big Bend and Dantzler contributing 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Noble Energy during the quarter. This drove Gulf of Mexico oil volumes up almost 100% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the Isabela workover was completed ahead of schedule, and Gunflint continues to progress toward a mid-year 2016 start-up. 
We recently commenced drilling an appraisal well at Katmai. This well will test resource upside to the 40 million to 60 million barrels of oil equivalent already discovered, and we anticipate results early in the fourth quarter. 
 
Sales volumes in West Africa averaged 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong underlying performance at Aseng and Alen continued during the quarter. And at Alba, installation of the new B3 compression platform was carried out with fewer downtime days than expected. Commissioning and start-up of the compression platform, which will enhance full field recovery, remains on schedule for mid-year. 
 
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged 266 million cubic feet of gas per day. This represents an increase of nearly 10% from the same period last year despite mild weather experienced thus far in 2016. With the Israeli government's mandate to reduce coal-fired generation by 15% year-over-year, we've seen consistent incremental coal-to-gas switching on the order of 50 million cubic feet per day gross with potential upside to that number. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before providing details on our adjusted guidance, I'd like to take a moment to provide a further update on our Israel projects. Tamar's production growth, resilient cash flows and access to significantly undersupplied markets make it one of the most attractive assets in the world. Leviathan is the same quality asset, on an even larger scale with a total recoverable resource of 22 trillion cubic feet of gas based on multiple appraisal wells drilled and a production test as well. 
 
In late March, Israel's Supreme Court acknowledged the strategic and national importance of these discoveries by upholding all but one of the provisions of the natural gas framework. The court recognized the importance of stabilization, but rejected the specific provision in the framework. We are engaged with the government as it works to timely address the Supreme Court's concern. 
In the meantime, we continue to progress the other 3 critical requirements for a Leviathan sanction: financing, marketing and technical readiness. We are pleased that the Israeli National Planning Committee recently approved the location of the Leviathan platform and pipeline connection in northern Israel. I am convinced that Leviathan, along with Tamar, will supply much-needed gas for both Israel and the neighboring region for decades. 
We've provided a full update to our 2016 guidance on Slide 11. Normally, I wouldn't change our outlook so early in the year, but this reflects the high level of confidence I have in our strategy, assets, execution and ultimately, our future.   
Full year sales are now expected to average 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4% from original guidance, with increased expectations for all 3 commodities. The production raise is based primarily on outperformance in the DJ Basin, Israel and West Africa. And on the capital side, we are trending on a path to come in under $1.5 billion. 
For the second quarter, capital is affected to be in line with the first quarter. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Volumes are expected to be impacted by seasonality in Israel and facility turnaround in the DJ Basin. This will be partially offset by significant quarter-over-quarter growth in Texas. We also expect higher volumes in West Africa as a result of Alba field production returning to full rate. 
In summary, I continue to be pleased with the capital efficiencies generated across the business. Our financial strengths, asset quality and onshore and offshore expertise give us a unique competitive advantage in any commodity environment. 
 
At this time, Levi, why don't we go ahead and open the call to questions?"

It was something in our plans we weren't going to be developing for a while, given where it fit in the portfolio, so it made sense to move forward. I'd say when we look at things in general, and it goes back to kind of what our philosophy has been as we've always looked at all parts of our portfolio. If we can create more value out of it than somebody else, then we're going to do that. If there's some reason that it can -- we can realize more value from it by moving it to somebody else's hands, we'll look at that. I think as we look at the year and what we've talked about previously, the one place where Noble continued to look at potential monetization of a portion of our business is over in Israel with Tamar, for example. We've talked about as part of the framework that in over 6 years, we'll look to bring down our interest from 36% to 25%. I'd say in the current environment, there's still a lot of interest in other folks wanting to get into that field. So there could be a possibility. We might bring down some of our interest this year, but it's too early to say. So I would say that's the main one we're continuing to stay focused on. Outside of that, we still have a big midstream business that we've kept that S-1 active. And at some point in time, I think we'll see some real value -- additional value come out of that part of the business, but that's kind of how I think about the portfolio. Most of it's all cored [ph] up, we don't have a lot of fringe pieces. But as in the case of this opportunity, if it makes sense to accelerate value, we'll look at it."

So it just goes to show why over the last couple of years, we've really been talking a lot about refocusing activity in the best of the best, which is the higher oil content areas, Wells Ranch and East Pony.

So that's partly driving that percentage up."

I mean, you certainly see it in the continuing improvement in the drilling performance where we continue to set records on a fairly consistent basis, taking a little bit of time off here and there of our previous records on drilling times. Slickwater is certainly -- have been a driver of it as well. Moving to monobore drilling has helped by taking a day, sometimes more than that, off of the wells as well. So -- and then in Wells Ranch and East Pony, where we've got existing infrastructure and the ability to drill those long laterals, which can drive your average cost per foot down as well, certainly help out. So do have some things that are offsetting that as we're moving to higher and higher sand concentrations and testing some tighter spacing in some areas, but the good news is we've been able to deliver enough efficiencies in all the other areas to more than offset that and continue to drive costs down. As we mentioned in the press release, we're down to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch on an extended reach well, adjusted back to a normal lateral length. And that's with some of the impact of the higher completion cost from the higher sand loading. If you go back to more of a traditional type completion design that we might have had in the past, those costs are down more to the $2.4 million range. So great job by the teams and continuing to execute and look for efficiencies."

Before diving into specifics on the quarter, I thought it'll be helpful to take a high-level view of our performance to date in 2016. Entering the year with an uncertain outlook on commodities, our stated focus was clear. First, operate the business within cash flows. Second, continue to improve capital efficiency to enhance returns. And third, increase our flexibility and financial strength by leveraging our portfolio. We are running well ahead of plan for the year and meeting or exceeding all of these identified goals. 
We've delivered another quarter where cash flow exceeded capital expenditures. We raised our full year 2016 volume expectation for a second time this year, providing an additional 10 million barrels of oil equivalent compared to our original expectation. We have accomplished this with less capital than original planned, an efficiency story that not many in our industry can match. 
We've also reset our underlying cost structures and continue to strengthen our financial position through a series of portfolio optimization transactions. 
Each of these accomplishment has improved our long-term outlook and generated significant value. 
In terms of what we control. In our business, I can easily say that we are executing as well as I've seen in my 14-year history with Noble. 
Moving into the second quarter results. It was a period of operational records and milestones. To name a few, Noble reported record total company sales volumes, led by our U.S. onshore assets and Israel. Over the last year, we realized that daily volume increase of nearly 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent, while absolute lease operating expense and G&A combined were actually down period-over-period. As part of the volume increase, 31,000 barrels per day were oil and 32,000 barrels per day were NGLs. 
Focusing onshore. In Texas, we brought online our best Delaware Basin well yet, along with several great Eagle Ford wells, extending our successes in these assets since we acquired them a year ago. In the DJ Basin, we enhanced our asset position through a strategic acreage exchange, adding additional depth of high-quality inventory in our core Wells Ranch IDP area. And in the Marcellus, wells continue to outperform expectation, enhancing resource recovery in this leading gas position. 
This operational momentum has continued offshore. Recent highlights include: In the Gulf of Mexico, we commenced production at Gunflint on time and under budget. In Equatorial Guinea, the Alba compression project has also started off. And in Israel, at the beginning of July, we entered into an agreement for an initial 3% divestiture of our world-class Tamar asset establishing a growth valuation benchmark of $12.3 billion. 
Second quarter volumes totaled 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 43% versus the second quarter of last year, or 18% on a pro forma basis. Performance for each business unit in commodity was ahead of expectations. This illustrates the benefits of our portfolio and industry-leading execution, continuing to drive differential value among our peer group. 
With respect to cost. Results were within or below our expectation on essentially every metric. Capital was below below the low end of guidance driven by efficiency gains and the shifting of some onshore wells into the second half of the year. Unit lease operating expense stood out, down 30% from the second quarter of last year. LOE per barrel equivalent benefited from record total production and deferred worker activity. 
I cannot overemphasize the strong performance of our Texas assets where completion optimization and a busy quarter of activity drove substantial growth. 
Our third Noble design Delaware Basin completion is showing robust productivity and a higher oil mix. Gary will share more on this well and our plans for the Delaware in a minute. 
Everyone seems curious how we and others are thinking about capital allocation for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our capital allocation discussion never stops as a continual process focused on delivering the best value and returns. The forward curve on oil has declined versus where it was the time of our last earnings call, and 2017 remains notably below the $50 level. The recent trend reflects resilient global supply and high inventories. The outlook on gas appears to have improved slightly for 2017 yet it softens quickly in the following years. Significant volatility in both commodities remain. We've not yet seen market fundamentals reach a point where we would consider changing our capital plans for the year. At the same time, our execution and operating performance has increased our inventory and resource potential for when the environment is appropriate to accelerate. And while total capital for the year remains under $1.5 billion, it has shifted slightly more toward the U.S. onshore unconventional plays where we have been able to exceed our production goals with fewer completions. Adding to our flexibility is the expectation that we will now exit this year with about 140 operated drilled and completed wells. This represents a decrease of just 10% from the beginning of the year, a higher inventory -- higher inventory than previously expected. 
As we look forward, our capital will be prioritize on accelerating our Delaware Basin position, developing our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and post sanction, implementing our first phase of Leviathan. Our other offshore assets will provide necessary cash to support these activities. The Marcellus program will be driven by the gas price outlook. 
With an improved liquidity profile following our asset sale proceeds, we're positioned to begin paying down debt by the end of the year, which will continue to lower Noble's underlying cost structure and further strengthen our balance sheet. Sufficient liquidity will be maintained to allow us increased activity when it make sense. 
We have executed as well as anyone during the volatility over the last 2 years. I am confident that our focus and disciplined strategy is the right approach in this environment. 
Let me know hand the call over to Gary to walk through an excellent operating performance."

As Dave mention, high levels of operating momentum continued in the second quarter, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. Operating and capital cost have been further reduced, and production from new wells is outperforming historical price curves in every one of our business units. 
I want to start off this quarter in Texas, where improvements we've made in both areas in a relatively short PUDs of time highlight the quality of our acreage and the value that Noble Energy can deliver. 
I'll start in the Delaware with the Calamity Jane 2101H well. To say this is an exciting well is an understatement, especially when you consider it's only our third completion in the basin. You can see on Slide 5 the location of the well versus the first 2 Noble completions. The 2101H well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length, and was completed with 3,000 pounds of profits per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. 
In absolute terms, we have 2,500 barrel of oil equivalent per day well, with 1,450 barrels of oil, 560 barrels of natural gas liquids and over 3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The chart shows the production compared to our prior 2 wells in the type curve. The first 2 wells continue to widen versus the 700,000-barrel equivalent type curve, and this latest well is even better. Versus type curve, this most recent well is more than 75% higher. 
From recent industry M&A activity is clear that the value of the Delaware Basin acreage continue to increase. Two reason transactions, specifically in and around our acreage, reaffirmed to me that we have a very enviable 45,000-acre position in the basin. Being early into the play, obviously generated tremendous amount of value. 
Wel have a rig operating in the Delaware continuously through the remainder of the year, with several new drills in the wells coming on production. Long-term development planning is underway, and our focus will be on delivering substantial well cost efficiencies by utilizing multiwell pad design and longer laterals and will also delineate multiple Wolfcamp zones in the Third Bone spring across our acreage. In addition, we're working to design centralized infrastructure, which will support our long-term plans. 
We also announced extremely strong results in the Eagle Ford this morning, specifically in the Gates Ranch area. Slightly more than half of the announced well had 500-foot lateral spacing with the remainder completed at 1,000-foot lateral spacing or more. And I want to emphasize a couple of takeaways from this results, which are shown on Slide 6. First, results continue to demonstrate the benefits of higher intensity fracs, specifically more profit with tighter cluster and spacing. A graet example of this is the 2 wells, which commenced production in the North Gates Ranch area during the quarter. These wells are performing above the 3 million-barrel equivalent type curve that we used for Southern Gates Ranch or 3x our prior assumption for North Gates Ranch. This follows similar significantly improved results in Briscoe Ranch, which we talked about last quarter. Second, we are gathering additional production history on lateral spacing, which will increase our drilling inventory going forward. With a 500-foot space well performing in line with a 3 million-barrel equivalent type curve, we believe that the South Gates Ranch area will support at least 750-foot spacing as we move into drilling and completing the fourth row of South South Gates Ranch during 2017. 
In addition to our Delaware rig activity, we have a rig coming into the Eagle Ford for the remainder of the year and have ongoing completion activity as well. Our Eagle Ford volumes will be lower in the third quarter reflecting shut in impacts from offsetting frac activity. Several new wells are expected to come online toward the end of the third quarter giving us strong momentum exiting the year and into 2017.  This will include wells in the Briscoe Ranch area, one of which will be in upper Eagle Ford test. 
Moving to the DJ Basin. The dominant theme to the new transformative capital efficiencies from drill time reductions and cost savings as well as performance improvements from enhanced completions. As we indicated on the first quarter call, our central processing facility underwent its first planned turnaround since starting out 3 years ago. As a result, the only wells which were brought online during the quarter were in May or June, and thus did not have a full quarter impact. The basin also experienced unplanned third-party facility downtime during the quarter. 
Once again, we reduced normalized extended reach lateral well cost. We are now down to $2.6 million in Wells Ranch, which represents a sequential quarterly decrease of another 4%. This includes the cost efficiency in modern bore drilling, which accounted for nearly all of our drilling activity during the second quarter as well as the increased cost of higher sand concentrations and higher stages. 
On the completion design front, the change for slickwater fluid as well as increasing profit loading continues. Now turn your attention to Slide 8, which provides more details. Cumulative production chart on the right show the actual averages for these new completion designs with 1,000 pounds of profit or more compared to the historical type curve. As you can see, performance in Wells Ranch is at least 15% higher-than-historical type curves, and East Pony has improved by more than 35%. With the continued strong performance improvement, I am excited about the potential impact of a higher percentage of these well designs coming online the remainder of the year. 
The new [indiscernible] motor pad and Mustang IDP includes our first 7 wells testing enhanced completions outside of Wells Ranch in East Pony. These wells came online at the end of the quarter and are significantly outperforming expectations, which speaks very positively for the future potential of our Mustang IDP development. 
During the quarter, we continue to optimize our large DJ Basin acreage position. We completed the first closing of the previously announced sale of approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area. This acreage was not in our development plans for many years. We received $486 million in proceeds, with the remaining $19 million expected around the end of the year. 
In addition, we completed our strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expands our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20% and provides substantial operating synergies and cost efficiencies for both companies. Both transactions are consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher well content where we have more contiguous acreage then drive efficiency gains for the long lateral development and existing infrastructure. 
As part of our focus on improving total value in the DJ Basin, we have been deferring workovers and repairs, especially for legacy vertical wells, when those expenditures just don't make sense in this price environment. As a result of these economic choices, vertical production is expected to be impacted by up to 5,000 barrels equipment per day during the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to the Marcellus. Production remains above expectations despite the limited capital spend. In addition, the JV continues to benefit from shared infrastructure to optimize recycling of produced water, significantly reducing our operating expenses. Recent pads in both the wet and dry gas areas continue to highlight the prolific nature of our position in the play as depicted on Slide 9. We remain aligned with our partner to operate the JV within cash flow in 2016 and will continue to be flexible with activities the remainder of the year. 
At current commodity prices, we expect 6 additional wells to be completed between now and year-end. The continued outstanding performance of the Marcellus wells has driven the growth seen by CONE, the midstream gathering company partially owned by Noble. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. We continue to see strong production for the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter. This is despite a temporary shut in of the Thunder Hawk facility in late June due to issues downstream third-party gas processing plant. 
In July, we brought online our Gunflint development on time and under budget. This is the third middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months contributing to the almost doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes this year.  The net amount from Gunflint in Noble Energy is expected to be at least 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with potential for additional volumes dependent upon available capacity and a third-party host facility. The 2 wells are currently ramping up as expected. 
Sales volumes in the West Africa were up from the first quarter, which had downtime from the installation of the new Alba B3 compression platform. Start-up of this Marathon-operated project, which will enhance full bill recovery, occurred in July. While Noble's quarterly sales volumes will fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter based on the lifting schedule, we would expect total West Africa production to remain relatively level for the remainder of the year. 
Our Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets don't often get the attention from the equity markets they deserve. The company's major project execution capabilities were highlighted again recently with the success of the Gunflint and Alba, and these capabilities continued to deliver substantial value for Noble Energy. 
Looking forward, near-term capital needs in both are relatively low and the assets remain significant cash flow generators. 
In Israel, natural gas volumes from Tamar were up nearly 30% from the same period last year and even higher than the first quarter of this year. Israeli government has mandated the reduction of coal-fired power generation by 15% year-over-year as shown on Slide 11. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and the confidence in the timing of the Leviathan development. This new underlying  base load demand is showing up in big numbers, particularly in the shoulder periods when additional quantities of gas have historically been available. As a result, coal power [indiscernible] is during the second quarter was down over 20% versus the second quarter of last year. We are now into the high demand third quarter period when Israel will need even more gas. 
We've also announced plans to commence drilling and other wells in Tamar later this year, which will reinforce reliability and help meet peak demand going forward. 
At Leviathan, we are continuing to target the final investment decision around year end. We've now contracted up to 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Israeli customers and continue to advance negotiations with additional domestic and regional customers. The regulatory progress we have a seen over the last quarter is also significant, including the government approval of the fixed platform plan and development. Feed work is under way, and early indications are that that this continues to be a great opportunity to log in very competitive cost for this long-life resource project. Over the coming months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanctions. This includes additional sales contracts, both in Israel and for the export market and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work and project cost estimates. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14.

We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment-adjusted basis, while reducing our original full year capital expenditure guidance. Not many companies will grow production at that rate while enhancing their financial position and without diluting shareholders. This is a testament to our high-quality portfolio and the underlying execution in our business delivered by our talented and dedicated workforce. 
For the third quarter, capital is expected to range between $400 million and $450 million with 80% going to the U.S. onshore business. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The primary difference from the second quarter is our Eagle Ford volumes due to well shut-ins for offsite completions. 
In our other onshore areas, Marcellus will likely be up in the third quarter, and DJ is expected to be down, reflecting lower vertical production, as Gary mentioned. Offshore volumes should be relatively flat to the second quarter with Israel up and West Africa lower due to timing of liftings. 
The third quarter outlook also includes the impact of about 2,000-barrel equivalent per day from the word sale in Montana and the initial closing of the Greeley Crescent divestiture. The production impact from asset sales grossed around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, with the second Greeley Crescent closing and the Tamar saledown already announced. These asset divestitures accelerate and highlight the value in our portfolio. 
There's a lot to look forward to in the second half of 2016. We have continuous operations ongoing in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basins, including the doubling of the new wells in the Delaware compared to the first half of the year. We will also continue to advance the enhanced completion designs in the DJ Basin and leverage our midstream competitive advantage. And in Israel, we expect to see higher utilization of our Tamar asset, while at the same time, progressing Leviathan towards final investment decisions. 
When you put it all together, this is a great company with a great future. The high-quality and deep inventory of our U.S. onshore portfolio can deliver high return growth for many years. This is complemented by the visible and prolific long-term growth in the value potential of the Eastern Med assets. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets provide meaningful and long-term cash generation. Portfolio execution and financial capacity, these are our competitive advantages and our strong foundation to build upon. 
At this time, Jake, we'll go ahead and open the call for questions."

I'll start to see significant savings on the DMC side, and that will probably come more in '17 as we get into full development mode as well. For the rest of this year, we're going to be testing different designs. So this latest well with 3,000 pounds per foot will actually go back and test some lower and concentration on these next couple of wells just as we zero in on what the best value case is. I think for us, we're always trying to look at what's the most of value-creating completion that we can design. It's not about IP-30, although clearly, we're very happy with this being our best IP 30 well to date and one of the best we've seen anywhere in the basin. It's certainly not about IP 24, it's not about EUR over the long term, it's about how much value we can create. So we'll test some smaller sand concentration designs as well as we zero in on that value, and we'll have another half dozen or so well by the time we get to the end of the year to help inform what our plans are for next year."

I think when you look at the third quarter too and a little bit in the fourth quarter, you got to not forget that we have to build in a little bit of assumption on some downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for both storms and potentially some of this onshore facility impact.

Another 4% just in 1 quarter is a pretty significant number, given how far we've already come.

I think in 2Q, you have the issues that you mentioned, the turnaround at the Wells Ranch central processing facility as well as some third-party gas plant downtime that impacted volumes. As we mentioned and you reiterated there, we've also held back on some workovers and repairs, especially on the vertical wells that just don't make sense in this price environment, so those have impacted vertical volumes. I think when you look at our level of activity going forward, with the type of performance we're seeing on these enhanced completions, even with 2 rigs, we're probably flat on horizontal production through the end of the year.

Before diving into the specifics on the quarter, I thought it'd be helpful to take a high-level view of our performance to date in 2016. Entering the year with an uncertain outlook on commodities, our stated focus was clear: first, operate the business within cash flows; second, continue to improve capital efficiency to enhance returns; and third, increase our flexibility and financial strength by leveraging our portfolio. We're running well ahead of plan for the year and meeting or exceeding all of these identified goals. 
We've delivered another quarter where cash flow exceeded capital expenditures. We raised our full year 2016 volume expectation for a second time this year, providing an additional 10 million barrels of oil equivalent compared to our original expectation. We have accomplished this with less capital than originally planned, an efficiency story that not many in our industry can match. We've also reset our underlying cost structure and continued to strengthen our financial position through a series of portfolio optimization transactions. Each of these accomplishments has improved our long-term outlook and generated significant value. 
In terms of what we control in our business, I can easily say that we are executing as well as I have seen in my 14-year history with Noble. 
Moving into the second quarter results. It was a period of operational records and milestones. To name a few, Noble reported record total company sales volumes, led by our U.S. onshore assets and Israel. Over the last year, we've realized a daily volume increase of nearly 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent, while absolute lease operating expense and G&A combined were actually down period-over-period. As part of the volume increase, 31,000 barrels per day were oil and 32,000 barrels per day were NGLs. 
Focusing onshore. In Texas, we brought online our best Delaware Basin well yet, along with several great Eagle Ford wells, extending our successes in these assets since we acquired them a year ago. In the DJ Basin, we enhanced our asset position through a strategic acreage exchange, adding additional depth of high-quality inventory in our core Wells Ranch IDP area. And in the Marcellus, wells continue to outperform expectation, enhancing resource recovery in this leading gas position. 
This operational momentum has continued offshore. Recent highlights include: in the Gulf of Mexico, we commenced production at Gunflint on time and under budget; in Equatorial Guinea, the Alba compression project has also started up; and in Israel, at the beginning of July, we entered into an agreement for an initial 3% divestiture of our world-class Tamar asset, establishing a gross valuation benchmark of $12.3 billion. Second quarter volumes totaled 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 43% versus the second quarter of last year or 18% on a pro forma basis. 
Performance for each business unit in commodity was ahead of expectations. This illustrates the benefits of our portfolio and industry-leading execution, continuing to drive differential value among our peer group. 
With respect to costs, results were within or below our expectation on essentially every metric. Capital was below the low end of guidance, driven by efficiency gains and the shifting of some onshore wells into the second half of the year. Unit lease operating expense stood out, down 30% from the second quarter of last year. LOE per barrel equivalent benefited from record total production and deferred workover activity. 
I cannot overemphasize the strong performance of our Texas assets, where completion optimization and a busy quarter of activity drove substantial growth. Our third Noble-designed Delaware Basin completion is showing robust productivity and a higher oil mix. Gary will share more on this well and our plans for the Delaware in a minute. 
Everyone seems curious how we and others are thinking about capital allocation for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our capital allocation discussion never stops. It's a continual process focused on delivering the best value and returns. The forward curve on oil has declined versus where it was the time of our last earnings call, and 2017 remains notably below the $50 level. The recent trend reflects resilient global supply and high inventories. The outlook on gas appears to have improved slightly for 2017, yet it softens quickly in the following years. Significant volatility in both commodities remains. We've not yet seen market fundamentals reach a point where we would consider changing our capital plans for the year. At the same time, our execution and operating performance has increased our inventory and resource potential for when the environment is appropriate to accelerate. But while total capital for the year remains under $1.5 billion, it has shifted slightly more toward the U.S. onshore unconventional liquid plays, where we have been able to exceed our production goals with fewer completions. Adding to our flexibility is the expectation that we will now exit this year with about 140 operated drilled and completed wells. This represents a decrease of just 10% from the beginning of the year, a higher inventory -- higher inventory than previously expected. 
As we look forward, our capital will be prioritized on accelerating our Delaware Basin position, developing our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and, post sanction, implementing our first phase of Leviathan. Our other offshore assets will provide necessary cash to support these activities. The Marcellus program will be driven by the gas price outlook. 
With an improved liquidity profile following our asset sale proceeds, we're positioned to begin paying down debt by the end of the year, which will continue to lower Noble's underlying cost structure and further strengthen our balance sheet. Sufficient liquidity will be maintained to allow us to increase activity when it makes sense. 
We have executed as well as anyone during the volatility over the last 2 years. I am confident that our focused and disciplined strategy is the right approach in this environment. 
Let me now hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."

As Dave mentioned, high levels of operating momentum continued in the second quarter, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. Operating and capital costs have been further reduced, and production from new wells is outperforming historical type curves in every one of our business units. 
I want to start off this quarter in Texas, where improvements we've made in both areas in a relatively short period of time highlight the quality of our acreage and the value that Noble Energy can deliver. I'll start on the Delaware with the Calamity Jane 2101H well. To say this is an exciting well is an understatement, especially when you consider it's only our third completion in the basin. You can see on Slide 5 the location of the well versus the first 2 Noble completions. The 2101H well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and was completed with 3,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. In absolute terms, we have a 2,500 barrel of oil equivalent per day well, with 1,450 barrels of oil, 560 barrels of natural gas liquids and over 3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The chart shows the production compared to our prior 2 wells in the type curve. The first 2 wells continue to widen versus the 700,000 barrel equivalent type curve, and this latest well is even better. Versus type curve, this most recent well is more than 75% higher. 
From recent industry M&A activity, it's clear that the value of the Delaware Basin acreage continues to increase. Two recent transactions, specifically in and around our acreage, reaffirmed to me that we have a very enviable 45,000-acre position in the basin. Being early into the play obviously generated a tremendous amount of value. 
We'll have a rig operating in the Delaware almost continuously through the remainder of the year, with several new drills and wells coming on production. Long-term development planning is underway, and our focus will be on delivering substantial well cost efficiencies by utilizing multi-well pad design and longer laterals, and we will also delineate multiple Wolfcamp zones in the Third Bone Spring across our acreage. In addition, we are working to design centralized infrastructure, which will support our long-term plans. 
We also announced extremely strong results in the Eagle Ford this morning, specifically in the Gates Ranch area. Slightly more than half of the announced wells had 500-foot lateral spacing, with the remainder completed at 1,000-foot lateral spacing or more. And I want to emphasize a couple of takeaways from these results, which are shown on Slide 6. First, results continue to demonstrate the benefits of higher-intensity fracs, specifically more proppant with tighter cluster and stage spacing. A great example of this is the 2 wells which commenced production in the North Gates Ranch area during the quarter. These wells are performing above the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve that we used for Southern Gates Ranch or 3x our prior assumption for North Gates Ranch. This follows similar significantly improved results in Briscoe Ranch, which we talked about last quarter. Second, we are gathering additional production history on lateral spacing, which will increase our drilling inventory going forward. With a 500-foot space well performing in line with the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve, we believe the South Gates Ranch area will support at least 750-foot spacing as we move into drilling and completing the fourth row of South Gates Ranch during 2017. 
In addition to our Delaware rig activity, we have a rig coming into the Eagle Ford for the remainder of the year and have ongoing completion activity as well. Our Eagle Ford volumes will be lower in the third quarter, reflecting shut-in impacts for offsetting frac activity. Several new wells are expected to come online toward the end of the third quarter, giving us strong momentum exiting the year and into 2017.  This will include wells in the Briscoe Ranch area, one of which will be an Upper Eagle Ford test. 
Moving to the DJ Basin. The dominant theme continues to be transformative capital efficiencies from drill time reductions and cost savings as well as performance improvements from enhanced completions. As we indicated on the first quarter call, our central processing facility underwent its first planned turnaround since starting up 3 years ago. As a result, the only wells which were brought online during the quarter were in May or June and, thus, did not have a full quarter impact. The basin also experienced unplanned third-party facility downtime during the quarter. 
Once again, we've reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well costs. We are now down to $2.6 million in Wells Ranch, which represents a sequential quarterly decrease of another 4%. This includes the cost efficiency of the monobore drilling, which accounted for nearly all of our drilling activity during the second quarter, as well as the increased cost of higher sand concentrations and higher stages. 
On the completion design front, the change to slickwater fluid as well as increasing proppant loading continues. And I'll turn your attention to Slide 8, which provides more details. Cumulative production charts on the right show the actual averages for these new completion designs, with 1,000 pounds of proppant or more compared to the historical type curve. As you can see, performance in Wells Ranch is at least 15% higher than historical type curve, and East Pony has improved by more than 35%. With continued strong performance improvement, I am excited about the potential impact of a higher percentage of these well designs coming online the remainder of the year. 
The new 10-well Moser pad and the Mustang IDP includes our first 7 wells testing enhanced completions outside of Wells Ranch and East Pony. These wells came online at the end of the quarter and are significantly outperforming expectations, which speaks very positively for the future potential of our Mustang IDP development. 
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our large DJ Basin acreage position. We completed the first closing of the previously announced sale of approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area. This acreage was not in our development plans for many years. We received $486 million in proceeds, with the remaining $19 million expected around the end of the year. In addition, we completed a strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expands our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20% and provides substantial operating synergies and cost efficiencies for both companies. Both transactions are consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage that can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. 
As part of our focus on improving total value in the DJ Basin, we have been deferring workovers and repairs, especially for legacy vertical wells, when those expenditures just don't make sense in this price environment. As a result of these economic choices, vertical production is expected to be impacted by up to 5,000 barrels equivalent per day during the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to the Marcellus. Production remains above expectations despite the limited capital spend. In addition, the JV continues to benefit from shared infrastructure to optimize recycling of produced water, significantly reducing our operating expenses. Recent pads in both the wet and dry gas areas continue to highlight the prolific nature of our position in the play, as depicted on Slide 9. We remain aligned with our partner to operate the JV within cash flow in 2016, and we'll continue to be flexible with activities for the remainder of the year. 
At current commodity prices, we expect 6 additional wells to be completed between now and year-end. The continued outstanding performance of the Marcellus wells has driven the growth seen by CONE, the midstream gathering company partially owned by Noble. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. We continued to see strong production for the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter. This is despite a temporary shut-in of the Thunder Hawk facility in late June due to issues with their downstream third-party gas processing plant. In July, we brought online our Gunflint development on time and under budget. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months, contributing to the almost doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes this year.  The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy is expected to be at least 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with potential for additional volumes dependent upon available capacity at the third-party host facility. The 2 wells are currently ramping up as expected. 
Sales volumes in West Africa were up from the first quarter, which had downtime from the installation of the new Alba B3 compression platform. Startup of this Marathon-operated project, which will enhance full field recovery, occurred in July. While Noble's quarterly sales volumes will fluctuate a bit quarter to quarter based on the lifting schedule, we would expect total West Africa production to remain relatively level for the remainder of the year. 
Our Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets don't often get the attention from the equity markets they deserve. The company's major project execution capabilities were highlighted again recently with the success of the Gunflint and Alba, and these capabilities continue to deliver substantial value for Noble Energy. Looking forward, near-term capital needs in both are relatively low, and the assets remain significant cash flow generators. 
In Israel, natural gas volumes from Tamar were up nearly 30% from the same period last year and even higher than the first quarter of this year. The Israeli government has mandated the reduction of coal-fired power generation by 15% year-over-year, as shown on Slide 11. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and their confidence in the timing of the Leviathan development. This new underlying  baseload demand is showing up in big numbers, particularly in the shoulder periods, when additional quantities of gas have historically been available. As a result, coal power dispatch during the second quarter was down over 20% versus the second quarter of last year. We are now into the high-demand third quarter period, when Israel will need even more gas. 
We've also announced plans to commence drilling another well at Tamar later this year, which will reinforce reliability and help meet peak demand going forward. At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end. We've now contracted up to 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Israeli customers and continue to advance negotiations with additional domestic and regional customers. The regulatory progress we have seen over the last quarter is also significant, including the government approval of the fixed platform Plan of Development. FEED work is underway, and early indications are that this continues to be a great opportunity to lock in very competitive cost for this long-life resource project. Over the coming months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional sales contracts, both in Israel and for the export market, and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work and project cost estimates. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment-adjusted",459,"Thanks, Gary. We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment-adjusted basis, while reducing our original full year capital expenditure guidance. Not many companies will grow production at that rate while enhancing their financial position and without diluting shareholders. This is a testament to our high-quality portfolio and the underlying execution in our business delivered by our talented and dedicated workforce. 
For the third quarter, capital is expected to range between $400 million and $450 million, with 80% going to the U.S. onshore business. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The primary difference from the second quarter is our Eagle Ford volumes due to well shut-ins for offset completions. 
In our other onshore areas, Marcellus will likely be up in the third quarter, and DJ is expected to be down, reflecting lower vertical production, as Gary mentioned. Offshore volumes should be relatively flat to the second quarter, with Israel up and West Africa lower due to timing of liftings. The third quarter outlook also includes the impact of about 2,000 barrel equivalent per day from the Bowdoin sale in Montana and the initial closing of the Greeley Crescent divestiture. The production impact from asset sales grossed around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, with the second Greeley Crescent closing and the Tamar sell-down already announced. These asset divestitures accelerate and highlight the value in our portfolio. 
There's a lot to look forward to in the second half of 2016. We have continuous operations ongoing in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basins, including a doubling of new wells in the Delaware compared to the first half of the year. We will also continue to advance the enhanced completion designs in the DJ Basin and leverage our midstream competitive advantage. And in Israel, we expect to see higher utilization of our Tamar asset while, at the same time, progressing Leviathan to a final investment decision. 
When you put it all together, this is a great company with a great future. The high quality and deep inventory of our U.S. onshore portfolio can deliver high return growth for many years. This is complemented by the visible and prolific long-term growth and value potential of the Eastern Med assets. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets provide meaningful and long-term cash generation. Portfolio, execution and financial capacity, these are our competitive advantages and our strong foundation to build upon. 
At this time, Jake, we'll go ahead and open the call for questions."

We're continuing to test different completion designs, so we're not quite in that full development mode yet that you would expect to see and start to see significant savings on the D&C side. That will probably come more in '17 as we get into full development mode as well. For the rest of this year, we're going to be testing different designs, though. This latest well with 3,000 pounds per foot, we'll actually go back and test some lower sand concentrations on these next couple of wells just as we zero in on what the best value case is. I think for us, we're always trying to look at what's the most value-creating completion that we can design. It's not about IP-30, although clearly, we're very happy with this being our best IP-30 well to date and one of the best we've seen anywhere in the basin. It's certainly not about IP-24, and it's not about EUR over the long term. It's about how much value we can create. So we'll test some smaller sand concentration designs as well as we zero in on that test value, and we'll have another half dozen or so well by the time we get to the end of the year to help inform what our plans are for next year."

And as we've talked about, we're well set up, and especially now also with some of the sell-down of the Tamar interest, to be able to fund that from kind of that ring-fenced strategy over there. As we look at the U.S., the Eagle Ford's been great returns. The Delaware performance highlights what the returns in that area can be, and the DJ has been strong returns. So then you're looking at in the Marcellus, I think we're still in the mode of continuing to manage to cash flow and working with our partner in that element. What we've said there is as gas price continues to increase, it provides more cash to continue to be able to spend in that arena. So I think when you put it all together, Brian, we're really going to have to continue to watch and stay flexible on how we allocate capital based on what our outlook on both oil and gas commodity is.

As you know, Charles, we've seen that before, but as far as the outlook on oil volumes, the U.S. or total, I mean, it's on track with what we've been expecting. I think when you look at the third quarter, too, and a little bit in the fourth quarter, you've got to not forget that we have to build in a little bit of assumption on some downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for both storms and potentially some of this onshore facility impact. So you have a little bit of that. But you have -- quarterly, you have volumes move around a good bit. For example, third quarter, the West Africa volumes, oil volumes will be under-lifted. But when we look at the projection going forward, we take a pretty hard look even at the horizontal volumes in the DJ, for example.

As we mentioned and you reiterated there, we've also held back on some workovers and repairs, especially on vertical wells that just don't make sense in this price environment, so those have impacted vertical volumes. I think when you look at our level of activity going forward, with the type of performance we're seeing on these enhanced completions, even with 2 rigs, we're probably flat on horizontal production through the end of the year.

Before diving into the specifics on the quarter, I thought it'd be helpful to take a high-level view of our performance to date in 2016. Entering the year with an uncertain outlook on commodities, our stated focus was clear: first, operate the business within cash flows; second, continue to improve capital efficiency to enhance returns; and third, increase our flexibility and financial strength by leveraging our portfolio. We're running well ahead of plan for the year and meeting or exceeding all of these identified goals. 
We've delivered another quarter where cash flow exceeded capital expenditures. We raised our full year 2016 volume expectation for a second time this year, providing an additional 10 million barrels of oil equivalent compared to our original expectation. We have accomplished this with less capital than originally planned, an efficiency story that not many in our industry can match. We've also reset our underlying cost structure and continued to strengthen our financial position through a series of portfolio optimization transactions. Each of these accomplishments has improved our long-term outlook and generated significant value. 
In terms of what we control in our business, I can easily say that we are executing as well as I have seen in my 14-year history with Noble. 
Moving into the second quarter results. It was a period of operational records and milestones. To name a few, Noble reported record total company sales volumes, led by our U.S. onshore assets and Israel. Over the last year, we've realized a daily volume increase of nearly 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent, while absolute lease operating expense and G&A combined were actually down period-over-period. As part of the volume increase, 31,000 barrels per day were oil and 32,000 barrels per day were NGLs. 
Focusing onshore. In Texas, we brought online our best Delaware Basin well yet, along with several great Eagle Ford wells, extending our successes in these assets since we acquired them a year ago. In the DJ Basin, we enhanced our asset position through a strategic acreage exchange, adding additional depth of high-quality inventory in our core Wells Ranch IDP area. And in the Marcellus, wells continue to outperform expectation, enhancing resource recovery in this leading gas position. 
This operational momentum has continued offshore. Recent highlights include: in the Gulf of Mexico, we commenced production at Gunflint on time and under budget; in Equatorial Guinea, the Alba compression project has also started up; and in Israel, at the beginning of July, we entered into an agreement for an initial 3% divestiture of our world-class Tamar asset, establishing a gross valuation benchmark of $12.3 billion. Second quarter volumes totaled 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 43% versus the second quarter of last year or 18% on a pro forma basis. 
Performance for each business unit in commodity was ahead of expectations. This illustrates the benefits of our portfolio and industry-leading execution, continuing to drive differential value among our peer group. 
With respect to costs, results were within or below our expectation on essentially every metric. Capital was below the low end of guidance, driven by efficiency gains and the shifting of some onshore wells into the second half of the year. Unit lease operating expense stood out, down 30% from the second quarter of last year. LOE per barrel equivalent benefited from record total production and deferred workover activity. 
I cannot overemphasize the strong performance of our Texas assets, where completion optimization and a busy quarter of activity drove substantial growth. Our third Noble-designed Delaware Basin completion is showing robust productivity and a higher oil mix. Gary will share more on this well and our plans for the Delaware in a minute. 
Everyone seems curious how we and others are thinking about capital allocation for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our capital allocation discussion never stops. It's a continual process focused on delivering the best value and returns. The forward curve on oil has declined versus where it was the time of our last earnings call, and 2017 remains notably below the $50 level. The recent trend reflects resilient global supply and high inventories. The outlook on gas appears to have improved slightly for 2017, yet it softens quickly in the following years. Significant volatility in both commodities remains. We've not yet seen market fundamentals reach a point where we would consider changing our capital plans for the year. At the same time, our execution and operating performance has increased our inventory and resource potential for when the environment is appropriate to accelerate. But while total capital for the year remains under $1.5 billion, it has shifted slightly more toward the U.S. onshore unconventional liquid plays, where we have been able to exceed our production goals with fewer completions. Adding to our flexibility is the expectation that we will now exit this year with about 140 operated drilled and completed wells. This represents a decrease of just 10% from the beginning of the year, a higher inventory -- higher inventory than previously expected. 
As we look forward, our capital will be prioritized on accelerating our Delaware Basin position, developing our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and, post sanction, implementing our first phase of Leviathan. Our other offshore assets will provide necessary cash to support these activities. The Marcellus program will be driven by the gas price outlook. 
With an improved liquidity profile following our asset sale proceeds, we're positioned to begin paying down debt by the end of the year, which will continue to lower Noble's underlying cost structure and further strengthen our balance sheet. Sufficient liquidity will be maintained to allow us to increase activity when it makes sense. 
We have executed as well as anyone during the volatility over the last 2 years. I am confident that our focused and disciplined strategy is the right approach in this environment. 
Let me now hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."

As Dave mentioned, high levels of operating momentum continued in the second quarter, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. Operating and capital costs have been further reduced, and production from new wells is outperforming historical type curves in every one of our business units. 
I want to start off this quarter in Texas, where improvements we've made in both areas in a relatively short period of time highlight the quality of our acreage and the value that Noble Energy can deliver. I'll start on the Delaware with the Calamity Jane 2101H well. To say this is an exciting well is an understatement, especially when you consider it's only our third completion in the basin. You can see on Slide 5 the location of the well versus the first 2 Noble completions. The 2101H well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and was completed with 3,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. In absolute terms, we have a 2,500 barrel of oil equivalent per day well, with 1,450 barrels of oil, 560 barrels of natural gas liquids and over 3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The chart shows the production compared to our prior 2 wells in the type curve. The first 2 wells continue to widen versus the 700,000 barrel equivalent type curve, and this latest well is even better. Versus type curve, this most recent well is more than 75% higher. 
From recent industry M&A activity, it's clear that the value of the Delaware Basin acreage continues to increase. Two recent transactions, specifically in and around our acreage, reaffirmed to me that we have a very enviable 45,000-acre position in the basin. Being early into the play obviously generated a tremendous amount of value. 
We'll have a rig operating in the Delaware almost continuously through the remainder of the year, with several new drills and wells coming on production. Long-term development planning is underway, and our focus will be on delivering substantial well cost efficiencies by utilizing multi-well pad design and longer laterals, and we will also delineate multiple Wolfcamp zones in the Third Bone Spring across our acreage. In addition, we are working to design centralized infrastructure, which will support our long-term plans. 
We also announced extremely strong results in the Eagle Ford this morning, specifically in the Gates Ranch area. Slightly more than half of the announced wells had 500-foot lateral spacing, with the remainder completed at 1,000-foot lateral spacing or more. And I want to emphasize a couple of takeaways from these results, which are shown on Slide 6. First, results continue to demonstrate the benefits of higher-intensity fracs, specifically more proppant with tighter cluster and stage spacing. A great example of this is the 2 wells which commenced production in the North Gates Ranch area during the quarter. These wells are performing above the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve that we used for Southern Gates Ranch or 3x our prior assumption for North Gates Ranch. This follows similar significantly improved results in Briscoe Ranch, which we talked about last quarter. Second, we are gathering additional production history on lateral spacing, which will increase our drilling inventory going forward. With a 500-foot space well performing in line with the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve, we believe the South Gates Ranch area will support at least 750-foot spacing as we move into drilling and completing the fourth row of South Gates Ranch during 2017. 
In addition to our Delaware rig activity, we have a rig coming into the Eagle Ford for the remainder of the year and have ongoing completion activity as well. Our Eagle Ford volumes will be lower in the third quarter, reflecting shut-in impacts for offsetting frac activity. Several new wells are expected to come online toward the end of the third quarter, giving us strong momentum exiting the year and into 2017.  This will include wells in the Briscoe Ranch area, one of which will be an Upper Eagle Ford test. 
Moving to the DJ Basin. The dominant theme continues to be transformative capital efficiencies from drill time reductions and cost savings as well as performance improvements from enhanced completions. As we indicated on the first quarter call, our central processing facility underwent its first planned turnaround since starting up 3 years ago. As a result, the only wells which were brought online during the quarter were in May or June and, thus, did not have a full quarter impact. The basin also experienced unplanned third-party facility downtime during the quarter. 
Once again, we've reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well costs. We are now down to $2.6 million in Wells Ranch, which represents a sequential quarterly decrease of another 4%. This includes the cost efficiency of the monobore drilling, which accounted for nearly all of our drilling activity during the second quarter, as well as the increased cost of higher sand concentrations and higher stages. 
On the completion design front, the change to slickwater fluid as well as increasing proppant loading continues. And I'll turn your attention to Slide 8, which provides more detail. Cumulative production charts on the right show the actual averages for these new completion designs, with 1,000 pounds of proppant or more compared to the historical type curve. As you can see, performance in Wells Ranch is at least 15% higher than historical type curve, and East Pony has improved by more than 35%. With continued strong performance improvement, I am excited about the potential impact of a higher percentage of these well designs coming online the remainder of the year. 
The new 10-well Moser pad and the Mustang IDP includes our first 7 wells testing enhanced completions outside of Wells Ranch and East Pony. These wells came online at the end of the quarter and are significantly outperforming expectations, which speaks very positively for the future potential of our Mustang IDP development. 
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our large DJ Basin acreage position. We completed the first closing of the previously announced sale of approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area. This acreage was not in our development plans for many years. We received $486 million in proceeds, with the remaining $19 million expected around the end of the year. In addition, we completed a strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expands our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20% and provides substantial operating synergies and cost efficiencies for both companies. Both transactions are consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage that can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. 
As part of our focus on improving total value in the DJ Basin, we have been deferring workovers and repairs, especially for legacy vertical wells, when those expenditures just don't make sense in this price environment. As a result of these economic choices, vertical production is expected to be impacted by up to 5,000 barrels equivalent per day during the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to the Marcellus. Production remains above expectations despite the limited capital spend. In addition, the JV continues to benefit from shared infrastructure to optimize recycling of produced water, significantly reducing our operating expenses. Recent pads in both the wet and dry gas areas continue to highlight the prolific nature of our position in the play, as depicted on Slide 9. We remain aligned with our partner to operate the JV within cash flow in 2016, and we'll continue to be flexible with activities for the remainder of the year. 
At current commodity prices, we expect 6 additional wells to be completed between now and year-end. The continued outstanding performance of the Marcellus wells has driven the growth seen by CONE, the midstream gathering company partially owned by Noble. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. We continued to see strong production for the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter. This is despite a temporary shut-in of the Thunder Hawk facility in late June due to issues with their downstream third-party gas processing plant. In July, we brought online our Gunflint development on time and under budget. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months, contributing to the almost doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes this year.  The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy is expected to be at least 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with potential for additional volumes dependent upon available capacity at the third-party host facility. The 2 wells are currently ramping up as expected. 
Sales volumes in West Africa were up from the first quarter, which had downtime from the installation of the new Alba B3 compression platform. Startup of this Marathon-operated project, which will enhance full field recovery, occurred in July. While Noble's quarterly sales volumes will fluctuate a bit quarter to quarter based on the lifting schedule, we would expect total West Africa production to remain relatively level for the remainder of the year. 
Our Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets don't often get the attention from the equity markets they deserve. The company's major project execution capabilities were highlighted again recently with the success of the Gunflint and Alba, and these capabilities continue to deliver substantial value for Noble Energy. Looking forward, near-term capital needs in both are relatively low, and the assets remain significant cash flow generators. 
In Israel, natural gas volumes from Tamar were up nearly 30% from the same period last year and even higher than the first quarter of this year. The Israeli government has mandated the reduction of coal-fired power generation by 15% year-over-year, as shown on Slide 11. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and their confidence in the timing of the Leviathan development. This new underlying  baseload demand is showing up in big numbers, particularly in the shoulder periods, when additional quantities of gas have historically been available. As a result, coal power dispatch during the second quarter was down over 20% versus the second quarter of last year. We are now into the high-demand third quarter period, when Israel will need even more gas. 
We've also announced plans to commence drilling another well at Tamar later this year, which will reinforce reliability and help meet peak demand going forward. At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end. We've now contracted up to 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Israeli customers and continue to advance negotiations with additional domestic and regional customers. The regulatory progress we have seen over the last quarter is also significant, including the government approval of the fixed platform Plan of Development. FEED work is underway, and early indications are that this continues to be a great opportunity to lock in very competitive cost for this long-life resource project. Over the coming months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional sales contracts, both in Israel and for the export market, and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work and project cost estimates. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment-adjusted",459,"Thanks, Gary. We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment-adjusted basis, while reducing our original full year capital expenditure guidance. Not many companies will grow production at that rate while enhancing their financial position and without diluting shareholders. This is a testament to our high-quality portfolio and the underlying execution in our business delivered by our talented and dedicated workforce. 
For the third quarter, capital is expected to range between $400 million and $450 million, with 80% going to the U.S. onshore business. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The primary difference from the second quarter is our Eagle Ford volumes due to well shut-ins for offset completions. 
In our other onshore areas, Marcellus will likely be up in the third quarter, and DJ is expected to be down, reflecting lower vertical production, as Gary mentioned. Offshore volumes should be relatively flat to the second quarter, with Israel up and West Africa lower due to timing of liftings. The third quarter outlook also includes the impact of about 2,000 barrel equivalent per day from the Bowdoin sale in Montana and the initial closing of the Greeley Crescent divestiture. The production impact from asset sales grossed around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, with the second Greeley Crescent closing and the Tamar sell-down already announced. These asset divestitures accelerate and highlight the value in our portfolio. 
There's a lot to look forward to in the second half of 2016. We have continuous operations ongoing in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basins, including a doubling of new wells in the Delaware compared to the first half of the year. We will also continue to advance the enhanced completion designs in the DJ Basin and leverage our midstream competitive advantage. And in Israel, we expect to see higher utilization of our Tamar asset while, at the same time, progressing Leviathan to a final investment decision. 
When you put it all together, this is a great company with a great future. The high quality and deep inventory of our U.S. onshore portfolio can deliver high return growth for many years. This is complemented by the visible and prolific long-term growth and value potential of the Eastern Med assets. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets provide meaningful and long-term cash generation. Portfolio, execution and financial capacity, these are our competitive advantages and our strong foundation to build upon. 
At this time, Jake, we'll go ahead and open the call for questions."

We're continuing to test different completion designs, so we're not quite in that full development mode yet that you would expect to see and start to see significant savings on the D&C side. That will probably come more in '17 as we get into full development mode as well. For the rest of this year, we're going to be testing different designs, though. This latest well with 3,000 pounds per foot, we'll actually go back and test some lower sand concentrations on these next couple of wells just as we zero in on what the best value case is. I think for us, we're always trying to look at what's the most value-creating completion that we can design. It's not about IP-30, although clearly, we're very happy with this being our best IP-30 well to date and one of the best we've seen anywhere in the basin. It's certainly not about IP-24, and it's not about EUR over the long term. It's about how much value we can create. So we'll test some smaller sand concentration designs as well as we zero in on that best value, and we'll have another half dozen or so wells by the time we get to the end of the year to help inform what our plans are for next year."

I think when you look at our capital program for '17, obviously, the capital in the Eastern Med will be driven by the timing of a Leviathan sanction. And as we've talked about, we're well set up, and especially now also with some of the sell-down of the Tamar interest, to be able to fund that from kind of that ring-fenced strategy over there. As we look at the U.S., the Eagle Ford's been great returns. The Delaware performance highlights what the returns in that area can be, and the DJ has been strong returns. So then you're looking at in the Marcellus, I think we're still in the mode of continuing to manage to cash flow and working with our partner in that element. What we've said there is as gas price continues to increase, it provides more cash to continue to be able to spend in that arena. So I think when you put it all together, Brian, we're really going to have to continue to watch and stay flexible on how we allocate capital based on what our outlook on both oil and gas commodity is. The good part is we have a lot of flexibility because we've got very little, what you'd call, nondiscretionary capital next year. I'd say it's all pretty much discretionary."

I think when you look at it going forward, it's going to move around some quarter by quarter, just from the liftings in West Africa. As you know, Charles, we've seen that before, but as far as the outlook on oil volumes, the U.S. or total, I mean, it's on track with what we've been expecting. I think when you look at the third quarter, too, and a little bit in the fourth quarter, you've got to not forget that we have to build in a little bit of assumption on some downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for both storms and potentially some of this onshore facility impact. So you have a little bit of that. But you have -- quarterly, you have volumes move around a good bit. For example, third quarter, the West Africa volumes, oil volumes will be under-lifted.

As we mentioned and you reiterated there, we've also held back on some workovers and repairs, especially on vertical wells that just don't make sense in this price environment, so those have impacted vertical volumes. I think when you look at our level of activity going forward, with the type of performance we're seeing on these enhanced completions, even with 2 rigs, we're probably flat on horizontal production through the end of the year.

Before diving into the specifics on the quarter, I thought it'd be helpful to take a high-level view of our performance to date in 2016. Entering the year with an uncertain outlook on commodities, our stated focus",997,"Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before diving into the specifics on the quarter, I thought it'd be helpful to take a high-level view of our performance to date in 2016. Entering the year with an uncertain outlook on commodities, our stated focus was clear: first, operate the business within cash flows; second, continue to improve capital efficiency to enhance returns; and third, increase our flexibility and financial strength by leveraging our portfolio. We're running well ahead of plan for the year and meeting or exceeding all of these identified goals. 
We've delivered another quarter where cash flow exceeded capital expenditures. We raised our full year 2016 volume expectation for a second time this year, providing an additional 10 million barrels of oil equivalent compared to our original expectation. We have accomplished this with less capital than originally planned, an efficiency story that not many in our industry can match. We've also reset our underlying cost structure and continued to strengthen our financial position through a series of portfolio optimization transactions. Each of these accomplishments has improved our long-term outlook and generated significant value. 
In terms of what we control in our business, I can easily say that we are executing as well as I have seen in my 14-year history with Noble. 
Moving into the second quarter results. It was a period of operational records and milestones. To name a few, Noble reported record total company sales volumes, led by our U.S. onshore assets and Israel. Over the last year, we've realized a daily volume increase of nearly 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent, while absolute lease operating expense and G&A combined were actually down period-over-period. As part of the volume increase, 31,000 barrels per day were oil and 32,000 barrels per day were NGLs. 
Focusing onshore. In Texas, we brought online our best Delaware Basin well yet, along with several great Eagle Ford wells, extending our successes in these assets since we acquired them a year ago. In the DJ Basin, we enhanced our asset position through a strategic acreage exchange, adding additional depth of high-quality inventory in our core Wells Ranch IDP area. And in the Marcellus, wells continue to outperform expectation, enhancing resource recovery in this leading gas position. 
This operational momentum has continued offshore. Recent highlights include: in the Gulf of Mexico, we commenced production at Gunflint on time and under budget; in Equatorial Guinea, the Alba compression project has also started up; and in Israel, at the beginning of July, we entered into an agreement for an initial 3% divestiture of our world-class Tamar asset, establishing a gross valuation benchmark of $12.3 billion. Second quarter volumes totaled 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 43% versus the second quarter of last year or 18% on a pro forma basis. 
Performance for each business unit in commodity was ahead of expectations. This illustrates the benefits of our portfolio and industry-leading execution, continuing to drive differential value among our peer group. 
With respect to costs, results were within or below our expectation on essentially every metric. Capital was below the low end of guidance, driven by efficiency gains and the shifting of some onshore wells into the second half of the year. Unit lease operating expense stood out, down 30% from the second quarter of last year. LOE per barrel equivalent benefited from record total production and deferred workover activity. 
I cannot overemphasize the strong performance of our Texas assets, where completion optimization and a busy quarter of activity drove substantial growth. Our third Noble-designed Delaware Basin completion is showing robust productivity and a higher oil mix. Gary will share more on this well and our plans for the Delaware in a minute. 
Everyone seems curious how we and others are thinking about capital allocation for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our capital allocation discussion never stops. It's a continual process focused on delivering the best value and returns. The forward curve on oil has declined versus where it was the time of our last earnings call, and 2017 remains notably below the $50 level. The recent trend reflects resilient global supply and high inventories. The outlook on gas appears to have improved slightly for 2017, yet it softens quickly in the following years. Significant volatility in both commodities remains. We've not yet seen market fundamentals reach a point where we would consider changing our capital plans for the year. At the same time, our execution and operating performance has increased our inventory and resource potential for when the environment is appropriate to accelerate. But while total capital for the year remains under $1.5 billion, it has shifted slightly more toward the U.S. onshore unconventional liquid plays, where we have been able to exceed our production goals with fewer completions. Adding to our flexibility is the expectation that we will now exit this year with about 140 operated drilled and completed wells. This represents a decrease of just 10% from the beginning of the year, a higher inventory -- higher inventory than previously expected. 
As we look forward, our capital will be prioritized on accelerating our Delaware Basin position, developing our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and, post sanction, implementing our first phase of Leviathan. Our other offshore assets will provide necessary cash to support these activities. The Marcellus program will be driven by the gas price outlook. 
With an improved liquidity profile following our asset sale proceeds, we're positioned to begin paying down debt by the end of the year, which will continue to lower Noble's underlying cost structure and further strengthen our balance sheet. Sufficient liquidity will be maintained to allow us to increase activity when it makes sense. 
We have executed as well as anyone during the volatility over the last 2 years. I am confident that our focused and disciplined strategy is the right approach in this environment. 
Let me now hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."

As Dave mentioned, high levels of operating momentum continued in the second quarter, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. Operating and capital costs have been further reduced, and production from new wells is outperforming historical type curves in every one of our business units. 
I want to start off this quarter in Texas, where improvements we've made in both areas in a relatively short period of time highlight the quality of our acreage and the value that Noble Energy can deliver. I'll start on the Delaware with the Calamity Jane 2101H well. To say this is an exciting well is an understatement, especially when you consider it's only our third completion in the basin. You can see on Slide 5 the location of the well versus the first 2 Noble completions. The 2101H well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and was completed with 3,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. In absolute terms, we have a 2,500 barrel of oil equivalent per day well, with 1,450 barrels of oil, 560 barrels of natural gas liquids and over 3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The chart shows the production compared to our prior 2 wells in the type curve. The first 2 wells continue to widen versus the 700,000 barrel equivalent type curve, and this latest well is even better. Versus type curve, this most recent well is more than 75% higher. 
From recent industry M&A activity, it's clear that the value of the Delaware Basin acreage continues to increase. Two recent transactions, specifically in and around our acreage, reaffirmed to me that we have a very enviable 45,000-acre position in the basin. Being early into the play obviously generated a tremendous amount of value. 
We'll have a rig operating in the Delaware almost continuously through the remainder of the year, with several new drills and wells coming on production. Long-term development planning is underway, and our focus will be on delivering substantial well cost efficiencies by utilizing multi-well pad design and longer laterals, and we will also delineate multiple Wolfcamp zones in the Third Bone Spring across our acreage. In addition, we are working to design centralized infrastructure, which will support our long-term plans. 
We also announced extremely strong results in the Eagle Ford this morning, specifically in the Gates Ranch area. Slightly more than half of the announced wells had 500-foot lateral spacing, with the remainder completed at 1,000-foot lateral spacing or more. And I want to emphasize a couple of takeaways from these results, which are shown on Slide 6. First, results continue to demonstrate the benefits of higher-intensity fracs, specifically more proppant with tighter cluster and stage spacing. A great example of this is the 2 wells which commenced production in the North Gates Ranch area during the quarter. These wells are performing above the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve that we used for Southern Gates Ranch or 3x our prior assumption for North Gates Ranch. This follows similar significantly improved results in Briscoe Ranch, which we talked about last quarter. Second, we are gathering additional production history on lateral spacing, which will increase our drilling inventory going forward. With a 500-foot space well performing in line with the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve, we believe the South Gates Ranch area will support at least 750-foot spacing as we move into drilling and completing the fourth row of South Gates Ranch during 2017. 
In addition to our Delaware rig activity, we have a rig coming into the Eagle Ford for the remainder of the year and have ongoing completion activity as well. Our Eagle Ford volumes will be lower in the third quarter, reflecting shut-in impacts for offsetting frac activity. Several new wells are expected to come online toward the end of the third quarter, giving us strong momentum exiting the year and into 2017. This will include wells in the Briscoe Ranch area, one of which will be an Upper Eagle Ford test. 
Moving to the DJ Basin. The dominant theme continues to be transformative capital efficiencies from drill time reductions and cost savings as well as performance improvements from enhanced completions. As we indicated on the first quarter call, our central processing facility underwent its first planned turnaround since starting up 3 years ago. As a result, the only wells which were brought online during the quarter were in May or June and, thus, did not have a full quarter impact. The basin also experienced unplanned third-party facility downtime during the quarter. 
Once again, we've reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well costs. We are now down to $2.6 million in Wells Ranch, which represents a sequential quarterly decrease of another 4%. This includes the cost efficiency of the monobore drilling, which accounted for nearly all of our drilling activity during the second quarter as well as the increased cost of higher sand concentrations and higher stages. 
On the completion design front, the change to slickwater fluid as well as increasing proppant loading continues. And I'll turn your attention to Slide 8, which provides more detail. Cumulative production charts on the right show the actual averages for these new completion designs, with 1,000 pounds of proppant or more compared to the historical type curve. As you can see, performance in Wells Ranch is at least 15% higher than historical type curve, and East Pony has improved by more than 35%. With continued strong performance improvement, I am excited about the potential impact of a higher percentage of these well designs coming online the remainder of the year. 
The new 10-well Moser pad and the Mustang IDP includes our first 7 wells testing enhanced completions outside of Wells Ranch and East Pony. These wells came online at the end of the quarter and are significantly outperforming expectations, which speaks very positively for the future potential of our Mustang IDP development. 
During the quarter, we continued to optimize our large DJ Basin acreage position. We completed the first closing of the previously announced sale of approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area. This acreage was not in our development plans for many years. We received $486 million in proceeds, with the remaining $19 million expected around the end of the year. In addition, we completed a strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expands our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20% and provides substantial operating synergies and cost efficiencies for both companies. Both transactions are consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage that can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. 
As part of our focus on improving total value in the DJ Basin, we have been deferring workovers and repairs, especially for legacy vertical wells, when those expenditures just don't make sense in this price environment. As a result of these economic choices, vertical production is expected to be impacted by up to 5,000 barrels equivalent per day during the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to the Marcellus. Production remains above expectations despite the limited capital spend. In addition, the JV continues to benefit from shared infrastructure to optimize recycling of produced water, significantly reducing our operating expenses. Recent pads in both the wet and dry gas areas continue to highlight the prolific nature of our position in the play, as depicted on Slide 9. We remain aligned with our partner to operate the JV within cash flow in 2016, and we'll continue to be flexible with activities for the remainder of the year. 
At current commodity prices, we expect 6 additional wells to be completed between now and year-end. The continued outstanding performance of the Marcellus wells has driven the growth seen by CONE, the midstream gathering company partially owned by Noble. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. We continued to see strong production for the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter. This is despite a temporary shut-in of the Thunder Hawk facility in late June due to issues with their downstream third-party gas processing plant. In July, we brought online our Gunflint development on time and under budget. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months, contributing to the almost doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes this year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy is expected to be at least 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with potential for additional volumes dependent upon available capacity at the third-party host facility. The 2 wells are currently ramping up as expected. 
Sales volumes in West Africa were up from the first quarter, which had downtime from the installation of the new Alba B3 compression platform. Startup of this Marathon-operated project, which will enhance full field recovery, occurred in July. While Noble's quarterly sales volumes will fluctuate a bit quarter to quarter based on the lifting schedule, we would expect total West Africa production to remain relatively level for the remainder of the year. 
Our Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets don't often get the attention from the equity markets they deserve. The company's major project execution capabilities were highlighted again recently with the success of the Gunflint and Alba, and these capabilities continue to deliver substantial value for Noble Energy. Looking forward, near-term capital needs in both are relatively low, and the assets remain significant cash flow generators. 
In Israel, natural gas volumes from Tamar were up nearly 30% from the same period last year and even higher than the first quarter of this year. The Israeli government has mandated the reduction of coal-fired power generation by 15% year-over-year, as shown on Slide 11. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and their confidence in the timing of the Leviathan development. This new underlying baseload demand is showing up in big numbers, particularly in the shoulder periods, when additional quantities of gas have historically been available. As a result, coal power dispatch during the second quarter was down over 20% versus the second quarter of last year. We are now into the high-demand third quarter period, when Israel will need even more gas. 
We've also announced plans to commence drilling another well at Tamar later this year, which will reinforce reliability and help meet peak demand going forward. At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end. We've now contracted up to 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Israeli customers and continue to advance negotiations with additional domestic and regional customers. The regulatory progress we have seen over the last quarter is also significant, including the government approval of the fixed platform Plan of Development. FEED work is underway, and early indications are that this continues to be a great opportunity to lock in very competitive cost for this long-life resource project. Over the coming months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional sales contracts, both in Israel and for the export market, and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work and project cost estimates. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14.

We've provided a full update of our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment-adjusted basis, while reducing our original full year capital expenditure guidance. Not many companies will grow production at that rate while enhancing their financial position and without diluting shareholders. This is a testament to our high-quality portfolio and the underlying execution in our business delivered by our talented and dedicated workforce. 
For the third quarter, capital is expected to range between $400 million and $450 million, with 80% going to the U.S. onshore business. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The primary difference from the second quarter is our Eagle Ford volumes due to well shut-ins for offset completions. 
In our other onshore areas, Marcellus will likely be up in the third quarter, and DJ is expected to be down, reflecting lower vertical production, as Gary mentioned. Offshore volumes should be relatively flat to the second quarter, with Israel up and West Africa lower due to timing of liftings. The third quarter outlook also includes the impact of about 2,000 barrel equivalent per day from the Bowdoin sale in Montana and the initial closing of the Greeley Crescent divestiture. The production impact from asset sales grossed around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, with the second Greeley Crescent closing and the Tamar sell-down already announced. These asset divestitures accelerate and highlight the value in our portfolio. 
There's a lot to look forward to in the second half of 2016. We have continuous operations ongoing in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basins, including a doubling of new wells in the Delaware compared to the first half of the year. We will also continue to advance the enhanced completion designs in the DJ Basin and leverage our midstream competitive advantage. And in Israel, we expect to see higher utilization of our Tamar asset while, at the same time, progressing Leviathan to a final investment decision. 
When you put it all together, this is a great company with a great future. The high quality and deep inventory of our U.S. onshore portfolio can deliver high return growth for many years. This is complemented by the visible and prolific long-term growth and value potential of the Eastern Med assets. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets provide meaningful and long-term cash generation. Portfolio, execution and financial capacity, these are our competitive advantages and our strong foundation to build upon. 
At this time, Jake, we'll go ahead and open the call for questions."

I think for the plans for the rest of the year, lateral length may get a little bit longer for the second half of this year, and then we'll really start to see longer lateral lengths probably beginning more in '17. We're continuing to test different completion designs, so we're not quite in that full development mode yet that you would expect to see and start to see significant savings on the D&C side. That will probably come more in '17 as we get into full development mode as well. For the rest of this year, we're going to be testing different designs, though. This latest well with 3,000 pounds per foot, we'll actually go back and test some lower sand concentrations on these next couple of wells just as we zero in on what the best value case is. I think for us, we're always trying to look at what's the most value-creating completion that we can design. It's not about IP-30, although clearly, we're very happy with this being our best IP-30 well to date and one of the best we've seen anywhere in the basin. It's certainly not about IP-24, and it's not about EUR over the long term. It's about how much value we can create. So we'll test some smaller sand concentration designs as well as we zero in on that best value, and we'll have another half dozen or so wells by the time we get to the end of the year to help inform what our plans are for next year."

I think when you look at our capital program for '17, obviously, the capital in the Eastern Med will be driven by the timing of a Leviathan sanction. And as we've talked about, we're well set up, and especially now also with some of the sell-down of the Tamar interest, to be able to fund that from kind of that ring-fenced strategy over there. As we look at the U.S., the Eagle Ford's been great returns. The Delaware performance highlights what the returns in that area can be, and the DJ has been strong returns. So then you're looking at in the Marcellus, I think we're still in the mode of continuing to manage to cash flow and working with our partner in that element. What we've said there is as gas price continues to increase, it provides more cash to continue to be able to spend in that arena. So I think when you put it all together, Brian, we're really going to have to continue to watch and stay flexible on how we allocate capital based on what our outlook on both oil and gas commodity is. The good part is we have a lot of flexibility because we've got very little, what you'd call, nondiscretionary capital next year. I'd say it's all pretty much discretionary."

I think in the Gulf of Mexico, they were down a little bit in the second quarter also from first quarter with some of the downtime that Gary mentioned on some of the onshore facilities. I think when you look at it going forward, it's going to move around some quarter by quarter, just from the liftings in West Africa. As you know, Charles, we've seen that before, but as far as the outlook on oil volumes, the U.S. or total, I mean, it's on track with what we've been expecting. I think when you look at the third quarter, too, and a little bit in the fourth quarter, you've got to not forget that we have to build in a little bit of assumption on some downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for both storms and potentially some of this onshore facility impact. So you have a little bit of that. But you have -- quarterly, you have volumes move around a good bit. For example, third quarter, the West Africa volumes, oil volumes will be under-lifted. But when we look at the projection going forward, we take a pretty hard look even at the horizontal volumes in the DJ, for example.

The balancing part of that is clearly the fact that we've seen better results from these enhanced completions. I think in 2Q, you have the issues that you mentioned, the turnaround at the Wells Ranch central processing facility as well as some third-party gas plant downtime that impacted volumes. As we mentioned and you reiterated there, we've also held back on some workovers and repairs, especially on vertical wells that just don't make sense in this price environment, so those have impacted vertical volumes. I think when you look at our level of activity going forward, with the type of performance we're seeing on these enhanced completions, even with 2 rigs, we're probably flat on horizontal production through the end of the year. Vertical will decline a bit. So overall, you'll be declining through the end of the year, as we've kind of suggested in the past.

I hope you've had a chance to review our third quarter 2016 operational and financial news release, which highlights once again robust outperformance for Noble Energy. We've also posted a few supplemental slides on our website. And later today, we anticipate filing our 10-Q with the SEC. 
Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will provide some commentary. While Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Med assets, will join for Q&A. 
I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full discover -- disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. 
Before highlighting our performance for the third quarter, I want to ensure you all saw the announcement that Noble Energy will be hosting an additional webcast in just 2 weeks, on November 16 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. Our team is looking forward to providing a long-term outlook, focusing on the company's U.S. onshore operations so you'll understand today if we saved our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Total volumes for the quarter were 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 12% in absolute and 8% pro forma over the third quarter of last year. Versus our internal expectations, total volumes were 15,000 barrels equivalent per day, above the midpoint of our range. 
By business unit, this was the result of higher-than-expected volumes in the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. By hydrocarbon, oil was a significant outperformer, comprising nearly 60% of the higher number. NGLs were also higher, and natural gas volumes reflected a record quarter from Tamar and Israel. 
We want to highlight that across the board, nearly every unit cost item came in under expectations as well. This was the result of higher-than-forecasted production and continued capital efficiency and cost control. The higher volumes and lower cost contributed to a meaningful earnings and cash flow beats for the quarter. Financial liquidity at the end of the third quarter grew to nearly $6 billion, including $1.8 billion in cash. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million following the very successful Noble Midstream IPO. As Noble Energy is the General partner, Noble Midstream's results are fully consolidated into Noble's financials. You probably noticed some specific adjustments in our earnings release tables to reflect the new public entity, both on the income statement and the balance sheet, where we have identified the portion attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Dave will talk more about the success of NBLX and how it positions us with competitive advantages for the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave."

After being unable to engage with you for the last couple of months due to the timing of our midstream IPO, I've been looking forward to this opportunity to share what Noble has accomplished, and we've accomplished a lot. 
As you look at our operating and financial numbers, they are up where we want them to be up and down where we want them to be down. Last quarter, I commented that Noble Energy was executing at the highest levels I have seen in my time with the company. Results from the most recent quarters solidify that view even further. 
Taking a look at Slide 3. We have delivered tremendous results everywhere: Volumes, product mix, cost control and cash generation. We're delivering everything we set out to accomplish in 2016 and more. Much more. 
Yet the numbers are only a part of the story. We've also recently accomplished some big things that are strategically significant to our future. These include the highly successful launch of the Noble Midstream IPO, the separation of the Marcellus JV to provide both companies independent control of their future development, the signing of Leviathan's first sizable sales export contract, the significant debt reduction helps support our long-term growth plans and an acceleration of our onshore development program. All of this was accomplished while delivering top-quartile debt adjusted production cash flow growth in 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, we will provide a view in our future at the November 16 investor event. The combination of our exceptional portfolio, leading operational execution and financial strength and flexibility provides significant competitive advantages differentiates our future, our growth potential and our value. 
This morning, I'd like to spend a few moments on a number of the recent major accomplishments mentioned. Steps along the path in delivering our future, steps that are enhancing our ability to accelerate our growth and steps that are generating industry-leading returns. 
Starting with operational execution. The momentum we have generated in every area of the business continues to deliver outstanding results. We highlighted in last night's release a number of new wells in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to push the leading edge of enhanced completions across our onshore business, and we remain encouraged by the productivity and capital efficiency improvements. 
We have recently added 2 rigs to our U.S. drilling programs, bringing our total onshore rig count to 6: 2 in the DJ, 2 in the Eagle Ford and 2 in the Delaware. Based upon our current view of pricing, we're positioned for additional activity increases in 2017. 
In the Eastern Mediterranean, third quarter volumes were outstanding. They reflect the high seasonal period in Israel and also the government's continued focus on increased dependence on gas usage for power generation. We've also made excellent progress on Leviathan and have line of sight on projects sanctioned around the end of the year or early next year. 
And in our other offshore areas, we benefited from strong reservoir and facility performance at Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. Both are producing higher rates than expected. 
Beyond operational -- beyond operations excellence, we have continued to strengthen our financial position. The successful IPO of our Noble Midstream business highlights tremendous work by Terry and the midstream team. With the IPO proceeds, this public vehicle has already returned the capital investments made in those assets back to Noble. The long-term value potential for both Noble and the NBLX orders is substantial. 
Slide 4 highlights the NBLX assets. And on Slide 5, we have shown a combined valuation to Noble for both Noble Midstream as well as CONE. In total, we estimate a midstream value for Noble at over $2.5 billion. This value is expected to grow quickly as we move into 2017 and beyond. 
Including the initial distribution from NBLX, we have generated almost $1.5 billion in portfolio proceeds this year and increased total liquidity to nearly $6 billion. We are in the enviable position of being able to accelerate development activity while also reducing leverage to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We're doing precisely what we have said we would do all year. 
Since the end of the third quarter, we have paid down $850 million of our term loan. With free cash flow being generated organically and expected portfolio proceeds, we still estimate that at the end of the year, we will have well over $5 billion in liquidity on hand. 
The third area of competitive advantage is our portfolio. Earlier this week, we, along with CONSOL, announced an intent to dissolve the upstream Marcellus joint venture. It's now been 5 years since we entered the asset with CONSOL. The accomplishments over that time period have been remarkable. Significant ramps in both production and recoverable resources have highlighted the strong coordination and technical excellence of both companies. 
Over the last several months, the parties focused on how to maximize value and flexibility. We agreed to split the upstream acreage and production in such a way that each party controls 100% of its assets and future activity. Noble will retain 100% working interest and 363,000 acres in current production of approximately 450 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We will keep our core wet gas Marcellus operations in Majorsville and Moundsville, including the Utica potential in Moundsville and substantial gas inventory for future development. 
You can see a before-and-after look of the transaction on Slide 7. Closing is anticipated before year-end. 
I'd like to personally express my appreciation to both the CONSOL and Noble teams that have worked so well together for the past 5 years. There are no changes to the CONE midstream ownership, acreage dedications or services. We will continue to work with CONSOL as sponsors to enhance the value of that business. 
Other recent portfolio optimization efforts have included the DJ Basin acreage trade and initial sell-down of our Tamar interest. We anticipate the Tamar transaction will close during the fourth quarter. 
On the topic of portfolio, I want to address the recent market speculation around Noble's interest in a potential Permian bolt-on acquisition. Let me be clear. We feel no urgency nor have any desire to bid up prices in the basin. And as always, we will be patient and selective in evaluating any additions to our position in the heart of the Delaware play. We remain focused on increasing drilling activity in our existing position, and we'll highlight during our call in 2 weeks how dramatically and quickly we can grow our volumes and increase our value there. 
Each step we have made over the last couple of years, including those mentioned today, has been centered on enhancing our future and the value potential for shareholders. Our company is well positioned and focused. Our capital is prioritized to accelerate our Delaware Basin asset, develop our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and post sanction implement the first phase of Leviathan. These themes will be clear in the investor call in 2 weeks. 
Now let me hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."

We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. 
Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's several thousand barrels equivalent per day higher than expected. This resulted from continued success with enhanced completions and relatively low line pressures throughout the basin. Majority of our activity in the DJ Basin continues to focus on the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas, although we also brought online several Mustang wells during the quarter. In total, we commenced production on 43 wells, with proppant concentration averaging over 1,600 pounds per lateral foot. I'm particularly encouraged about some DJ wells that have recently come on production, testing even higher proppant concentrations, 2,000 pounds plus. And we should have some Wells Ranch higher results for you on the call in a couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, we completed the previously announced strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expanded our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20%. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through longer lateral development and existing infrastructure. For Noble, this transaction added substantial value to our forward development plans. 
Moving to Texas. We continued our successes in the Delaware with the Johnny Ringo 9 3H well. The well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. Another outstanding well, one of the top 2 industry wells in the third quarter in the basin. Total production from the well is almost 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 70% oil. 
For the second rig added to our position there, the pace of our drilling and completions will ramp up quickly. Fourth quarter activity will be higher than the first 3 quarters of the year combined, with an even further acceleration into 2017. I'm excited about the fact that we are now doing our first pad drilling in our first long lateral wells. Also, we will soon be testing multiple zones beyond the Wolfcamp Bay that we have in the heart of the Delaware Basin. 
Over in the Eagle Ford, we announced strong results from the wells in Gates Ranch. The 5 lower Eagle Ford wells we brought on line in the quarter had 500-foot lateral spacing at an average lateral length of nearly 5,900 feet. IP-30 rates have averaged more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
During the third quarter, we shot in 33 Eagle Ford wells for about a month to perform offset tracks. In the fourth quarter, we're bringing on a number of new wells in Briscoe Ranch, including a couple in the upper Eagle Ford. and they will be Noble's first tests of this potentially large resource. 
Dave mentioned earlier the recent production performance at Tamar. As a result of the increasing Israeli gas demand outlook, we recently commenced drilling an additional development well at Tamar. And this well will provide reliability and additional production capacity. 
At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end or early next year. We've now contracted up to 450 million cubic feet per day for 15 years, equating to estimated gross revenues of more than $12 billion. Our recent contracts with the National Electric Power Company of Jordan represents the first Leviathan export contract. We look forward to supplying gas to Jordan for many years into the future. The Leviathan FID work continues, and we're making substantial progress on all of the bids and awards. Over the next couple of months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanctions. This concludes additional domestic sales contracts and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work, project cost estimates and required construction permits. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we brought online our Gunflint development in mid-July. This is the third middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months. And these 3 contributed to the more than doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes over the last year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy during the quarter was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is higher than expected due to additional open capacity at the host facility. 
We continue to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter and recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary in both of these fields. 
We've provided fourth quarter 2016 guidance on Slide 8. As mentioned in the press release, we are increasing our fourth quarter capital guidance to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting the rig additions and higher activity levels. Even with this activity acceleration, we will still be well under $1.5 billion in capital this year. 
We have maintained our previous fourth quarter volume guidance despite the impact of asset divestitures that were not previously modeled. Otherwise, we would've projected above the high end of our 400,000 to 410,000 barrels equivalent per day range. The largest of these transactions is the Marcellus JV separation that Dave talked to earlier. With the close anticipated in November, we expect about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact on the fourth quarter. Making up the difference is higher volumes than previously expected in the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, which also contribute to a slightly higher oil mix for the quarter as well. 
We also reduced a few of our cost item expectations for the fourth quarter, including LOE and G&A. There are a lot of catalysts to look forward to as we approach 2017. Drilling activity is accelerating. The effectiveness of enhanced completions in all basins continues to improve, and we're leveraging our onshore infrastructure advantage with NBLX. In addition, our offshore assets continue to generate substantial cash flows to the business, and a sanction at Leviathan is near. We will have much more to show in 2 weeks. I hope you will plan to join us then as well. 
And at this time, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions."

But as you look forward and looked at it from just the whole portfolio aspect for each company, it made a lot of sense to set it up where each company could operate and drive at 100% their own portion of it. I think when we look at it going forward, we like the position we have there, especially the ability to control the timing and pace of development. And so we'll just see how that plays out and look at it relative to the returns of the other parts of our portfolio as we make decisions on capital allocation. But we like the position. It does give some nice option value and the best gas basin in the U.S. and it's still a significant position."

We talked about that in the past, extremely excited about the performance of those wells. And this is now in the southern half of what we consider the Mustang IDP. So it's pretty good step out from where we've been most active over the last couple of years in Wells Ranch and East Pony. Very pleased with the results that we've seen. Again, it's an area where we can drill long laterals. We're just now starting to build on the infrastructure for that area, so we'll be able to take advantage of the efficiencies and the cost reductions from that when that's constructed just like we have in Wells Ranch and East Pony. But very excited about the results. EURs have been well above the type curve projections. And that's an area that as we get infrastructure built out over the next year or so, you'll see more activity in that area."

[Operator Instructions] Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will provide some commentary. While Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Med assets, will join for Q&A. 
I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full discover -- disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. 
Before highlighting our performance for the third quarter, I want to ensure you all saw the announcement that Noble Energy will be hosting an additional webcast in just 2 weeks, on November 16 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. Our team is looking forward to providing a long-term outlook, focusing on the company's U.S. onshore operations so you'll understand today if we save our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Total volumes for the quarter were 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 12% in absolute and 8% pro forma over the third quarter of last year. Versus our internal expectations, total volumes were 15,000 barrels equivalent per day, above the midpoint of our range. 
By business unit, this was the result of higher-than-expected volumes in the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. By hydrocarbon, oil was a significant outperformer, comprising nearly 60% of the higher number. NGLs were also higher, and natural gas volumes reflected a record quarter from Tamar and Israel. 
We want to highlight that across the board, nearly every unit cost item came in under expectations as well. This was the result of higher-than-forecasted production and continued capital efficiency and cost control. The higher volumes and lower costs contributed to meaningful earnings and cash flow beats for the quarter. Financial liquidity at the end of the third quarter grew to nearly $6 billion, including $1.8 billion in cash. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million following the very successful Noble Midstream IPO. As Noble Energy is the general partner, Noble Midstream's results are fully consolidated into Noble's financials. You probably noticed some specific adjustments in our earnings release tables to reflect the new public entity, both on the income statement and the balance sheet, where we have identified the portion attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Dave will talk more about the success of NBLX and how it positions us with competitive advantages for the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave."

After being unable to engage with you for the last couple of months due to the timing of our Midstream IPO, I've been looking forward to this opportunity to share what Noble has accomplished, and we've accomplished a lot. 
As you look at our operating and financial numbers, they are up where we want them to be up and down where we want them to be down. Last quarter, I commented that Noble Energy was executing at the highest levels I have seen in my time with the company. Results from the most recent quarters solidify that view even further. 
Taking a look at Slide 3. We have delivered tremendous results everywhere: Volumes, product mix, cost control and cash generation. We're delivering everything we set out to accomplish in 2016 and more, much more. 
Yet the numbers are only a part of the story. We've also recently accomplished some big things that are strategically significant to our future. These include the highly successful launch of the Noble Midstream IPO, the separation of the Marcellus JV to provide both companies independent control of their future development, the signing of Leviathan's first sizable sales export contract, a significant debt reduction to help support our long-term growth plans and an acceleration of our onshore development program. All of this was accomplished while delivering top-quartile debt-adjusted production cash flow growth in 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, we will provide a view into our future at the November 16 investor event. The combination of our exceptional portfolio, leading operational execution and financial strength and flexibility provide significant competitive advantages, differentiates our future, our growth potential and our value. 
This morning, I'd like to spend a few moments on a number of the recent major accomplishments mentioned. Steps along the path in delivering our future, steps that are enhancing our ability to accelerate our growth and steps that are generating industry-leading returns. 
Starting with operational execution. The momentum we have generated in every area of the business continues to deliver outstanding results. We highlighted in last night's release a number of new wells in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to push the leading edge of enhanced completions across our onshore business, and we remain encouraged by the productivity and capital efficiency improvements. 
We have recently added 2 rigs to our U.S. drilling programs, bringing our total onshore rig count to 6: 2 in the DJ, 2 in the Eagle Ford and 2 in the Delaware. Based upon our current view of pricing, we're positioned for additional activity increases in 2017. 
In the Eastern Mediterranean, third quarter volumes were outstanding. They reflect the high seasonal period in Israel and also the government's continued focus on increased dependence on gas usage for power generation. We've also made excellent progress on Leviathan and have line of sight on projects sanctioned around the end of the year or early next year. 
And in our other offshore areas, we benefited from strong reservoir and facility performance at Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. Both are producing higher rates than expected. 
Beyond operational -- beyond operations excellence, we have continued to strengthen our financial position. The successful IPO of our Noble Midstream business highlights tremendous work by Terry Gerhart in the Midstream team. With the IPO proceeds, this public vehicle has already returned the capital investments made in those assets back to Noble. The long-term value potential for both Noble and the NBLX orders [ph] is substantial. 
Slide 4 highlights the NBLX assets. And on Slide 5, we have shown a combined valuation to Noble for both Noble Midstream as well as CONE. In total, we estimate a midstream value for Noble at over $2.5 billion. This value is expected to grow quickly as we move into 2017 and beyond. 
Including the initial distribution from NBLX, we have generated almost $1.5 billion in portfolio proceeds this year and increased total liquidity to nearly $6 billion. We are in the enviable position of being able to accelerate development activity while also reducing leverage to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We're doing precisely what we have said we would do all year. 
Since the end of the third quarter, we have paid down $850 million of our term loan. With free cash flow being generated organically and expected portfolio proceeds, we still estimate that at the end of the year, we will have well over $5 billion in liquidity on hand. 
The third area of competitive advantage is our portfolio. Earlier this week, we, along with CONSOL, announced an intent to dissolve the upstream Marcellus joint venture. It's now been 5 years since we entered the asset with CONSOL. The accomplishments over that time period have been remarkable. Significant ramps in both production and recoverable resources have highlighted the strong coordination and technical excellence of both companies. 
Over the last several months, the parties focused on how to maximize value and flexibility. We agreed to split the upstream acreage and production in such a way that each party controls 100% of its assets and future activity. Noble will retain 100% working interest and 363,000 acres in current production of approximately 450 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We will keep our core wet gas Marcellus operations in Majorsville and Moundsville, including the Utica potential in Moundsville and substantial gas inventory for future development. 
You can see a before-and-after look of the transaction on Slide 7. Closing is anticipated before year-end. 
I'd like to personally express my appreciation to both the CONSOL and Noble teams that have worked so well together for the past 5 years. There are no changes to the CONE midstream ownership, acreage dedications or services. We will continue to work with CONSOL as sponsors to enhance the value of that business. 
Other recent portfolio optimization efforts have included the DJ Basin acreage trade and initial sell-down of our Tamar interest. We anticipate the Tamar transaction will close during the fourth quarter. 
On the topic of portfolio, I want to address the recent market speculation around Noble's interest in a potential Permian bolt-on acquisition. Let me be clear. We feel no urgency nor have any desire to bid up prices in the basin. And as always, we will be patient and selective in evaluating any additions to our position in the heart of the Delaware play. We remain focused on increasing drilling activity in our existing position, and we'll highlight during our call in 2 weeks how dramatically and quickly we can grow our volumes and increase our value there. 
Each step we have made over the last couple of years, including those mentioned today, has been centered on enhancing our future and the value potential for shareholders. Our company is well positioned and focused. Our capital is prioritized to accelerate our Delaware Basin asset, develop our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and postsanction implement the first phase of Leviathan. These themes will be clear on the investor call in 2 weeks. 
Now let me hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."
292135,402607096,1070242,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's",1042,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. 
Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's several thousand barrels equivalent per day higher than expected. This resulted from continued success with enhanced completions and relatively low line pressures throughout the basin. Majority of our activity in the DJ Basin continues to focus on the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas, although we also brought online several Mustang wells during the quarter. In total, we commenced production on 43 wells, with proppant concentration averaging over 1,600 pounds per lateral foot. I'm particularly encouraged about some DJ wells that have recently come on production, testing even higher proppant concentrations, 2,000 pounds plus. And we should have some Wells Ranch higher intensity results for you on the call in a couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, we completed the previously announced strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expanded our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20%. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through longer lateral development and existing infrastructure. For Noble, this transaction added substantial value to our forward development plans. 
Moving to Texas. We continued our successes in the Delaware with the Johnny Ringo 9 3H well. The well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. Another outstanding well, one of the top 2 industry wells in the third quarter in the basin. Total production from the well is almost 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 70% oil. 
With the second rig added to our position there, the pace of our drilling and completions will ramp up quickly. Fourth quarter activity will be higher than the first 3 quarters of the year combined, with an even further acceleration into 2017. I'm excited about the fact that we are now doing our first pad drilling in our first long lateral wells. Also, we will soon be testing multiple zones beyond the Wolfcamp Bay that we have in the heart of the Delaware Basin. 
Over in the Eagle Ford, we announced strong results from new wells in Gates Ranch. The 5 lower Eagle Ford wells we brought on line in the quarter had 500-foot lateral spacing and an average lateral length of nearly 5,900 feet. IP-30 rates have averaged more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
During the third quarter, we shut-in 33 Eagle Ford wells for about a month to perform offset fracs.
In the fourth quarter, we're bringing on a number of new wells in Briscoe Ranch, including a couple in the upper Eagle Ford, and they will be Noble's first tests of this potentially large resource. 
Dave mentioned earlier the recent production performance at Tamar. As a result of the increasing Israeli gas demand outlook, we recently commenced drilling an additional development well at Tamar. And this well will provide reliability and additional production capacity. 
At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end or early next year. We've now contracted up to 450 million cubic feet per day for 15 years, equating to estimated gross revenues of more than $12 billion. Our recent contracts with the National Electric Power Company of Jordan represents the first Leviathan export contract. We look forward to supplying gas to Jordan for many years into the future. The Leviathan FID work continues, and we're making substantial progress on all of the bids and awards. Over the next couple of months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional domestic sales contracts and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work, project cost estimates and required construction permits. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we brought online our Gunflint development in mid-July. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months. And these 3 contributed to the more than doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes over the last year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy during the quarter was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is higher than expected due to additional open capacity at the host facility. 
We continue to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter and recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary in both of these fields. 
We've provided fourth quarter 2016 guidance on Slide 8. As mentioned in the press release, we are increasing our fourth quarter capital guidance to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting the rig additions and higher activity levels. Even with this activity acceleration, we will still be well under $1.5 billion in capital this year. 
We have maintained our previous fourth quarter volume guidance despite the impact of asset divestitures that were not previously modeled. Otherwise, we would've projected above the high end of our 400,000 barrel equivalent per day to 410,000 barrel equivalent per day range. The largest of these transactions is the Marcellus JV separation that Dave talked to you earlier. With the close anticipated in November, we expect about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact on the fourth quarter. Making up the difference is higher volumes than previously expected in the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, which also contribute to a slightly higher oil mix for the quarter as well. 
We also reduced a few of our cost item expectations for the fourth quarter, including LOE and G&A. There are a lot of catalysts to look forward to as we approach 2017. Drilling activity is accelerating. The effectiveness of enhanced completions in all basins continues to improve, and we're leveraging our onshore infrastructure advantage with NBLX. In addition, our offshore assets continue to generate substantial cash flows to the business, and a sanction at Leviathan is near. We will have much more to show in 2 weeks. I hope you will plan to join us then as well. 
And at this time, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions."

So that will be a good supporter of activity going forward. I think the other elements you mentioned, how you look at your balance sheet. The key element also is just how do you efficiently and effectively drive the growth activity. And that's something that you want to make sure you're doing it efficiently, so you're creating value as you go and you're creating the most value you can and optimizing the asset base as you go. So all of those things are going to be considerations.

We said at that time we'll continue to test different ranges. That's what we're continuing to do. We've got another 5-or-so wells, 6 wells coming on in the fourth quarter. Those will be different proppant levels as well, testing all the way up to 5,000 pounds per foot. So we'll see those results here in another 3 months or so. So we're very much still optimizing what the right completion strategy is for these wells. I think, to that your second part of your question, it does pretty clearly, I think, demonstrate the quality of the acreage and the potential that's there as we continue to develop the most efficient strategy for playing this out. As we noted in the prepared comments, according to a third-party report that's out there, this well is the second-best well in the basin in the third quarter.

I hope you've had a chance to review our third quarter 2016 operational and financial news release, which highlights once again robust outperformance for Noble Energy. We've also posted a few supplemental slides on our website. And later today, we anticipate filing our 10-Q with the SEC. 
Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will provide some commentary. While Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Med assets, will join for Q&A. 
I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full discover -- disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. 
Before highlighting our performance for the third quarter, I want to ensure you all saw the announcement that Noble Energy will be hosting an additional webcast in just 2 weeks, on November 16 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. Our team is looking forward to providing a long-term outlook, focusing on the company's U.S. onshore operations so you'll understand today if we save our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Total volumes for the quarter were 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 12% in absolute and 8% pro forma over the third quarter of last year. Versus our internal expectations, total volumes were 15,000 barrels equivalent per day, above the midpoint of our range. 
By business unit, this was the result of higher-than-expected volumes in the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. By hydrocarbon, oil was a significant outperformer, comprising nearly 60% of the higher number. NGLs were also higher, and natural gas volumes reflected a record quarter from Tamar and Israel. 
We want to highlight that across the board, nearly every unit cost item came in under expectations as well. This was the result of higher-than-forecasted production and continued capital efficiency and cost control. The higher volumes and lower costs contributed to meaningful earnings and cash flow beats for the quarter. Financial liquidity at the end of the third quarter grew to nearly $6 billion, including $1.8 billion in cash. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million following the very successful Noble Midstream IPO. As Noble Energy is the general partner, Noble Midstream's results are fully consolidated into Noble's financials. You probably noticed some specific adjustments in our earnings release tables to reflect the new public entity, both on the income statement and the balance sheet, where we have identified the portion attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Dave will talk more about the success of NBLX and how it positions us with competitive advantages for the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave."

After being unable to engage with you for the last couple of months due to the timing of our Midstream IPO, I've been looking forward to this opportunity to share what Noble has accomplished, and we've accomplished a lot. 
As you look at our operating and financial numbers, they are up where we want them to be up and down where we want them to be down. Last quarter, I commented that Noble Energy was executing at the highest levels I have seen in my time with the company. Results from the most recent quarters solidify that view even further. 
Taking a look at Slide 3. We have delivered tremendous results everywhere: Volumes, product mix, cost control and cash generation. We're delivering everything we set out to accomplish in 2016 and more, much more. 
Yet the numbers are only a part of the story. We've also recently accomplished some big things that are strategically significant to our future. These include the highly successful launch of the Noble Midstream IPO, the separation of the Marcellus JV to provide both companies independent control of their future development, the signing of Leviathan's first sizable sales export contract, a significant debt reduction to help support our long-term growth plans and an acceleration of our onshore development program. All of this was accomplished while delivering top-quartile debt-adjusted production cash flow growth in 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, we will provide a view into our future at the November 16 investor event. The combination of our exceptional portfolio, leading operational execution and financial strength and flexibility provide significant competitive advantages, differentiates our future, our growth potential and our value. 
This morning, I'd like to spend a few moments on a number of the recent major accomplishments mentioned. Steps along the path in delivering our future, steps that are enhancing our ability to accelerate our growth and steps that are generating industry-leading returns. 
Starting with operational execution. The momentum we have generated in every area of the business continues to deliver outstanding results. We highlighted in last night's release a number of new wells in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to push the leading edge of enhanced completions across our onshore business, and we remain encouraged by the productivity and capital efficiency improvements. 
We have recently added 2 rigs to our U.S. drilling programs, bringing our total onshore rig count to 6: 2 in the DJ, 2 in the Eagle Ford and 2 in the Delaware. Based upon our current view of pricing, we're positioned for additional activity increases in 2017. 
In the Eastern Mediterranean, third quarter volumes were outstanding. They reflect the high seasonal period in Israel and also the government's continued focus on increased dependence on gas usage for power generation. We've also made excellent progress on Leviathan and have line of sight on projects sanctioned around the end of the year or early next year. 
And in our other offshore areas, we benefited from strong reservoir and facility performance at Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. Both are producing at higher rates than expected. 
Beyond operational -- beyond operations excellence, we have continued to strengthen our financial position. The successful IPO of our Noble Midstream business highlights tremendous work by Terry Gerhart and the Midstream team. With the IPO proceeds, this public vehicle has already returned the capital investments made in those assets back to Noble. The long-term value potential for both Noble and the NBLX unit holders [ph] is substantial. 
Slide 4 highlights the NBLX assets. And on Slide 5, we have shown a combined valuation to Noble for both Noble Midstream as well as CONE. In total, we estimate a midstream value for Noble at over $2.5 billion. This value is expected to grow quickly as we move into 2017 and beyond. 
Including the initial distribution from NBLX, we have generated almost $1.5 billion in portfolio proceeds this year and increased total liquidity to nearly $6 billion. We are in the enviable position of being able to accelerate development activity while also reducing leverage to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We're doing precisely what we have said we would do all year. 
Since the end of the third quarter, we have paid down $850 million of our term loan. With free cash flow being generated organically and expected portfolio proceeds, we still estimate that at the end of the year, we will have well over $5 billion in liquidity on hand. 
The third area of competitive advantage is our portfolio. Earlier this week, we, along with CONSOL, announced an intent to dissolve the upstream Marcellus joint venture. It's now been 5 years since we entered the asset with CONSOL. The accomplishments over that time period have been remarkable. Significant ramps in both production and recoverable resources have highlighted the strong coordination and technical excellence of both companies. 
Over the last several months, the parties focused on how to maximize value and flexibility. We agreed to split the upstream acreage and production in such a way that each party controls 100% of its assets and future activity. Noble will retain 100% working interest and 363,000 acres in current production of approximately 450 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We will keep our core wet gas Marcellus operations in Majorsville and Moundsville, including the Utica potential in Moundsville and substantial gas inventory for future development. 
You can see a before-and-after look of the transaction on Slide 7. Closing is anticipated before year-end. 
I'd like to personally express my appreciation to both the CONSOL and Noble teams that have worked so well together for the past 5 years. There are no changes to the CONE midstream ownership, acreage dedications or services. We will continue to work with CONSOL as sponsors to enhance the value of that business. 
Other recent portfolio optimization efforts have included the DJ Basin acreage trade and initial sell-down of our Tamar interest. We anticipate the Tamar transaction will close during the fourth quarter. 
On the topic of portfolio, I want to address the recent market speculation around Noble's interest in a potential Permian bolt-on acquisition. Let me be clear. We feel no urgency nor have any desire to bid up prices in the basin. And as always, we will be patient and selective in evaluating any additions to our position in the heart of the Delaware play. We remain focused on increasing drilling activity in our existing position, and we'll highlight during our call in 2 weeks how dramatically and quickly we can grow our volumes and increase our value there. 
Each step we have made over the last couple of years, including those mentioned today, has been centered on enhancing our future and the value potential for shareholders. Our company is well positioned and focused. Our capital is prioritized to accelerate our Delaware Basin asset, develop our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and post sanction implement the first phase of Leviathan. These themes will be clear on the investor call in 2 weeks. 
Now let me hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."
292135,402607096,1070502,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's",1041,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. 
Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's several thousand barrels equivalent per day higher than expected. This resulted from continued success with enhanced completions and relatively low line pressures throughout the basin. Majority of our activity in the DJ Basin continues to focus on the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas, although we also brought online several Mustang wells during the quarter. In total, we commenced production on 43 wells, with proppant concentration averaging over 1,600 pounds per lateral foot. I'm particularly encouraged about some DJ wells that have recently come on production, testing even higher proppant concentrations, 2,000 pounds plus. And we should have some Wells Ranch higher intensity results for you on the call in a couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, we completed the previously announced strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expanded our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20%. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through longer lateral development and existing infrastructure. For Noble, this transaction added substantial value to our forward development plans. 
Moving to Texas. We continued our successes in the Delaware with the Johnny Ringo 9 3H well. The well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. Another outstanding well, one of the top 2 industry wells in the third quarter in the basin. Total production from the well is almost 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 70% oil. 
With the second rig added to our position there, the pace of our drilling and completions will ramp up quickly. Fourth quarter activity will be higher than the first 3 quarters of the year combined, with an even further acceleration into 2017. I'm excited about the fact that we are now doing our first pad drilling in our first long lateral wells. Also, we will soon be testing multiple zones beyond the Wolfcamp Bay that we have in the heart of the Delaware Basin. 
Over in the Eagle Ford, we announced strong results from new wells in Gates Ranch. The 5 lower Eagle Ford wells we brought on line in the quarter had 500-foot lateral spacing and an average lateral length of nearly 5,900 feet. IP-30 rates have averaged more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
During the third quarter, we shut-in 33 Eagle Ford wells for about a month to perform offset fracs.
In the fourth quarter, we're bringing on a number of new wells in Briscoe Ranch, including a couple in the upper Eagle Ford, and they will be Noble's first tests of this potentially large resource. 
Dave mentioned earlier the recent production performance at Tamar. As a result of the increasing Israeli gas demand outlook, we recently commenced drilling an additional development well at Tamar. And this well will provide reliability and additional production capacity. 
At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end or early next year. We've now contracted up to 450 million cubic feet per day for 15 years, equating to estimated gross revenues of more than $12 billion. Our recent contracts with the National Electric Power Company of Jordan represents the first Leviathan export contract. We look forward to supplying gas to Jordan for many years into the future. The Leviathan FID work continues, and we're making substantial progress on all of the bids and awards. Over the next couple of months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional domestic sales contracts and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work, project cost estimates and required construction permits. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we brought online our Gunflint development in mid-July. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months. And these 3 contributed to the more than doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes over the last year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy during the quarter was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is higher than expected due to additional open capacity at the host facility. 
We continue to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter and recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary in both of these fields. 
We've provided fourth quarter 2016 guidance on Slide 8. As mentioned in the press release, we are increasing our fourth quarter capital guidance to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting the rig additions and higher activity levels. Even with this activity acceleration, we will still be well under $1.5 billion in capital this year. 
We have maintained our previous fourth quarter volume guidance despite the impact of asset divestitures that were not previously modeled. Otherwise, we would've projected above the high end of our 400,000 barrel equivalent per day to 410,000 barrel equivalent per day range. The largest of these transactions is the Marcellus JV separation that Dave talked through earlier. With the close anticipated in November, we expect about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact on the fourth quarter. Making up the difference is higher volumes than previously expected in the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, which also contribute to a slightly higher oil mix for the quarter as well. 
We also reduced a few of our cost item expectations for the fourth quarter, including LOE and G&A. There are a lot of catalysts to look forward to as we approach 2017. Drilling activity is accelerating. The effectiveness of enhanced completions in all basins continues to improve, and we're leveraging our onshore infrastructure advantage with NBLX. In addition, our offshore assets continue to generate substantial cash flows to the business, and a sanction at Leviathan is near. We will have much more to show in 2 weeks. I hope you will plan to join us then as well. 
And at this time, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions."

I think we're certainly still in the phase of optimizing completions in the area, figuring out what the right proppant concentration is as we complete these wells. This is really the fourth well that we've brought on as Noble Energy. And we completed this when we were 2,500 pounds of proppant. The third well, we were at 3,000 pounds of proppant. We said at that time we'll continue to test different ranges. That's what we're continuing to do. We've got another 5-or-so wells, 6 wells coming on in the fourth quarter. Those will be different proppant levels as well, testing all the way up to 5,000 pounds per foot. So we'll see those results here in another 3 months or so. So we're very much still optimizing what the right completion strategy is for these wells. I think, to that your second part of your question, it does pretty clearly, I think, demonstrate the quality of the acreage and the potential that's there as we continue to develop the most efficient strategy for playing this out. As we noted in the prepared comments, according to a third-party report that's out there, this well is the second-best well in the basin in the third quarter. So still a lot to do, still a lot of improvement. I think we can get beyond this, but hard to be disappointed in what we've seen so far. That's for sure."

I hope you've had a chance to review our third quarter 2016 operational and financial news release, which highlights once again robust outperformance for Noble Energy. We've also posted a few supplemental slides on our website. And later today, we anticipate filing our 10-Q with the SEC. 
Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will provide some commentary. While Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Med assets, will join for Q&A. 
I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full discover -- disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. 
Before highlighting our performance for the third quarter, I want to ensure you all saw the announcement that Noble Energy will be hosting an additional webcast in just 2 weeks, on November 16 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. Our team is looking forward to providing a long-term outlook, focusing on the company's U.S. onshore operations so you'll understand today if we save our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
Now let's get to the numbers. Total volumes for the quarter were 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 12% in absolute and 8% pro forma over the third quarter of last year. Versus our internal expectations, total volumes were 15,000 barrels equivalent per day, above the midpoint of our range. 
By business unit, this was the result of higher-than-expected volumes in the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. By hydrocarbon, oil was a significant outperformer, comprising nearly 60% of the higher number. NGLs were also higher, and natural gas volumes reflected a record quarter from Tamar and Israel. 
We want to highlight that across the board, nearly every unit cost item came in under expectations as well. This was the result of higher-than-forecasted production and continued capital efficiency and cost control. The higher volumes and lower costs contributed to meaningful earnings and cash flow beats for the quarter. Financial liquidity at the end of the third quarter grew to nearly $6 billion, including $1.8 billion in cash. 
During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million following the very successful Noble Midstream IPO. As Noble Energy is the general partner, Noble Midstream's results are fully consolidated into Noble's financials. You probably noticed some specific adjustments in our earnings release tables to reflect the new public entity, both on the income statement and the balance sheet, where we have identified the portion attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Dave will talk more about the success of NBLX and how it positions us with competitive advantages for the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave."

After being unable to engage with you for the last couple of months due to the timing of our Midstream IPO, I've been looking forward to this opportunity to share what Noble has accomplished, and we've accomplished a lot. 
As you look at our operating and financial numbers, they are up where we want them to be up and down where we want them to be down. Last quarter, I commented that Noble Energy was executing at the highest levels I have seen in my time with the company. Results from the most recent quarters solidify that view even further. 
Taking a look at Slide 3. We have delivered tremendous results everywhere: Volumes, product mix, cost control and cash generation. We're delivering everything we set out to accomplish in 2016 and more, much more. 
Yet the numbers are only a part of the story. We've also recently accomplished some big things that are strategically significant to our future. These include the highly successful launch of the Noble Midstream IPO, the separation of the Marcellus JV to provide both companies independent control of their future development, the signing of Leviathan's first sizable sales export contract, a significant debt reduction to help support our long-term growth plans and an acceleration of our onshore development program. All of this was accomplished while delivering top-quartile debt-adjusted production cash flow growth in 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, we will provide a view into our future at the November 16 investor event. The combination of our exceptional portfolio, leading operational execution and financial strength and flexibility provide significant competitive advantages, differentiates our future, our growth potential and our value. 
This morning, I'd like to spend a few moments on a number of the recent major accomplishments mentioned. Steps along the path in delivering our future, steps that are enhancing our ability to accelerate our growth and steps that are generating industry-leading returns. 
Starting with operational execution. The momentum we have generated in every area of the business continues to deliver outstanding results. We highlighted in last night's release a number of new wells in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to push the leading edge of enhanced completions across our onshore business, and we remain encouraged by the productivity and capital efficiency improvements. 
We have recently added 2 rigs to our U.S. drilling programs, bringing our total onshore rig count to 6: 2 in the DJ, 2 in the Eagle Ford and 2 in the Delaware. Based upon our current view of pricing, we're positioned for additional activity increases in 2017. 
In the Eastern Mediterranean, third quarter volumes were outstanding. They reflect the high seasonal period in Israel and also the government's continued focus on increased dependence on gas usage for power generation. We've also made excellent progress on Leviathan and have line of sight on projects sanctioned around the end of the year or early next year. 
And in our other offshore areas, we benefited from strong reservoir and facility performance at Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea. Both are producing at higher rates than expected. 
Beyond operational -- beyond operations excellence, we have continued to strengthen our financial position. The successful IPO of our Noble Midstream business highlights tremendous work by Terry Gerhart and the Midstream team. With the IPO proceeds, this public vehicle has already returned the capital investments made in those assets back to Noble. The long-term value potential for both Noble and the NBLX unit holders [ph] is substantial. 
Slide 4 highlights the NBLX assets. And on Slide 5, we have shown a combined valuation to Noble for both Noble Midstream as well as CONE. In total, we estimate a midstream value for Noble at over $2.5 billion. This value is expected to grow quickly as we move into 2017 and beyond. 
Including the initial distribution from NBLX, we have generated almost $1.5 billion in portfolio proceeds this year and increased total liquidity to nearly $6 billion. We are in the enviable position of being able to accelerate development activity while also reducing leverage to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We're doing precisely what we have said we would do all year. 
Since the end of the third quarter, we have paid down $850 million of our term loan. With free cash flow being generated organically and expected portfolio proceeds, we still estimate that at the end of the year, we will have well over $5 billion in liquidity on hand. 
The third area of competitive advantage is our portfolio. Earlier this week, we, along with CONSOL, announced an intent to dissolve the upstream Marcellus joint venture. It's now been 5 years since we entered the asset with CONSOL. The accomplishments over that time period have been remarkable. Significant ramps in both production and recoverable resources have highlighted the strong coordination and technical excellence of both companies. 
Over the last several months, the parties focused on how to maximize value and flexibility. We agreed to split the upstream acreage and production in such a way that each party controls 100% of its assets and future activity. Noble will retain 100% working interest and 363,000 acres in current production of approximately 450 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We will keep our core wet gas Marcellus operations in Majorsville and Moundsville, including the Utica potential in Moundsville and substantial gas inventory for future development. 
You can see a before-and-after look of the transaction on Slide 7. Closing is anticipated before year-end. 
I'd like to personally express my appreciation to both the CONSOL and Noble teams that have worked so well together for the past 5 years. There are no changes to the CONE midstream ownership, acreage dedications or services. We will continue to work with CONSOL as sponsors to enhance the value of that business. 
Other recent portfolio optimization efforts have included the DJ Basin acreage trade and initial sell-down of our Tamar interest. We anticipate the Tamar transaction will close during the fourth quarter. 
On the topic of portfolio, I want to address the recent market speculation around Noble's interest in a potential Permian bolt-on acquisition. Let me be clear. We feel no urgency nor have any desire to bid up prices in the basin. And as always, we will be patient and selective in evaluating any additions to our position in the heart of the Delaware play. We remain focused on increasing drilling activity in our existing position, and we'll highlight during our call in 2 weeks how dramatically and quickly we can grow our volumes and increase our value there. 
Each step we have made over the last couple of years, including those mentioned today, has been centered on enhancing our future and the value potential for shareholders. Our company is well positioned and focused. Our capital is prioritized to accelerate our Delaware Basin asset, develop our DJ and Eagle Ford positions and post sanction implement the first phase of Leviathan. These themes will be clear on the investor call in 2 weeks. 
Now let me hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance."

We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's",1041,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today. 
Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's several thousand barrels equivalent per day higher than expected. This resulted from continued success with enhanced completions and relatively low line pressures throughout the basin. Majority of our activity in the DJ Basin continues to focus on the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas, although we also brought online several Mustang wells during the quarter. In total, we commenced production on 43 wells, with proppant concentration averaging over 1,600 pounds per lateral foot. I'm particularly encouraged about some DJ wells that have recently come on production, testing even higher proppant concentrations, 2,000 pounds plus. And we should have some Wells Ranch higher intensity results for you on the call in a couple of weeks. 
During the quarter, we completed the previously announced strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expanded our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20%. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through longer lateral development and existing infrastructure. For Noble, this transaction added substantial value to our forward development plans. 
Moving to Texas. We continued our successes in the Delaware with the Johnny Ringo 9 3H well. The well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. Another outstanding well, one of the top 2 industry wells in the third quarter in the basin. Total production from the well is almost 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 70% oil. 
With the second rig added to our position there, the pace of our drilling and completions will ramp up quickly. Fourth quarter activity will be higher than the first 3 quarters of the year combined, with an even further acceleration into 2017. I'm excited about the fact that we are now doing our first pad drilling in our first long lateral wells. Also, we will soon be testing multiple zones beyond the Wolfcamp Bay that we have in the heart of the Delaware Basin. 
Over in the Eagle Ford, we announced strong results from new wells in Gates Ranch. The 5 lower Eagle Ford wells we brought on line in the quarter had 500-foot lateral spacing and an average lateral length of nearly 5,900 feet. IP-30 rates have averaged more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
During the third quarter, we shut-in 33 Eagle Ford wells for about a month to perform offset fracs.
In the fourth quarter, we're bringing on a number of new wells in Briscoe Ranch, including a couple in the upper Eagle Ford, and they will be Noble's first tests of this potentially large resource. 
Dave mentioned earlier the recent production performance at Tamar. As a result of the increasing Israeli gas demand outlook, we recently commenced drilling an additional development well at Tamar. And this well will provide reliability and additional production capacity. 
At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end or early next year. We've now contracted up to 450 million cubic feet per day for 15 years, equating to estimated gross revenues of more than $12 billion. Our recent contracts with the National Electric Power Company of Jordan represents the first Leviathan export contract. We look forward to supplying gas to Jordan for many years into the future. The Leviathan FID work continues, and we're making substantial progress on all of the bids and awards. Over the next couple of months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional domestic sales contracts and financing plans as well as completion of the engineering work, project cost estimates and required construction permits. 
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we brought online our Gunflint development in mid-July. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months. And these 3 contributed to the more than doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes over the last year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy during the quarter was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is higher than expected due to additional open capacity at the host facility. 
We continue to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter and recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary in both of these fields. 
We've provided fourth quarter 2016 guidance on Slide 8. As mentioned in the press release, we are increasing our fourth quarter capital guidance to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting the rig additions and higher activity levels. Even with this activity acceleration, we will still be well under $1.5 billion in capital this year. 
We have maintained our previous fourth quarter volume guidance despite the impact of asset divestitures that were not previously modeled. Otherwise, we would've projected above the high end of our 400,000 barrel equivalent per day to 410,000 barrel equivalent per day range. The largest of these transactions is the Marcellus JV separation that Dave talked through earlier. With the close anticipated in November, we expect about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact on the fourth quarter. Making up the difference is higher volumes than previously expected in the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, which also contribute to a slightly higher oil mix for the quarter as well. 
We also reduced a few of our cost item expectations for the fourth quarter, including LOE and G&A. There are a lot of catalysts to look forward to as we approach 2017. Drilling activity is accelerating. The effectiveness of enhanced completions in all basins continues to improve, and we're leveraging our onshore infrastructure advantage with NBLX. In addition, our offshore assets continue to generate substantial cash flows to the business, and a sanction at Leviathan is near. We will have much more to show in 2 weeks. I hope you will plan to join us then as well. 
And at this time, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions."

But as far as lateral length, yes, there's pretty big disparity between what we drilled in 3Q at over 9,000 feet and what we brought online at around 6,000 feet. A part of that is where the activity has been focused. A large part of the wells we brought on in 3Q were in East Pony, which tend to be a little shorter lateral length. Most of what we drilled in 3Q within Wells Ranch, which tends to be longer lateral lengths. I think when you think about going forward, in Wells Ranch we'll continue to see those long laterals, as we move into areas in Mustang, in the coming years, you'll see long laterals there as well. Certainly, our preference is to continue to drill those long laterals everywhere we can, plus or minus 9,000 feet. So that's the way I'd think about it in the areas that we're active in."
