During the conference call, Alan and I will",752,"Thank you, Brent. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. 
During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $6.76 for the year and $1.74 for the quarter. After adjusting for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as well as the other items attributable to last year's fourth quarter as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 12% to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $152 million or $1.51 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues, less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense, divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.1% and 27.9% during the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and '14, respectively. 
On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues increased 7.3% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions increased 4.8%, while revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.3%. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 16.8% during the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015 as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014. This small decrease is primarily attributable to $199 million unfavorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting mainly from the timing of disbursements.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 52 days during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 54 days during the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45%. We spent $110 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $379 million during the full year of 2015. During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $425 million on capital expenditures, which include expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.
In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 478,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we purchased an additional 887,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $99 million. $77 million remains on the previous authorization, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an additional $400 million in share repurchases. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.17 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2016, as described in our press release. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 4% to 10% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $6.87 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule included in last night's press release.
During 2016, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $9.75 billion to $9.85 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over 2015 net revenues. 
We are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think we've been fairly transparent over the course of last few months in talking about our outlook for next year. In terms of the 2 segments, I think, on the acute side, we see revenue growth of about 6% next year in the acute division, same-store. On the behavioral side, probably a little bit lower, maybe 5%. I think the acute care 6% is split fairly evenly between price and volume. And I think the behavioral 5% is percentage probably weighted a little more towards volume rather than to price. And I think in both divisions, we expect margins to increase slightly if we can achieve those revenue growth levels. In terms of unusual items or other things that are sort of not included in what I just went through, we have talked, for many quarters now, that we will be opening a new sixth acute care hospital in Las Vegas. We estimate that to occur in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. That's probably a $5 million to $10 million EBITDA drag on the back half of next year as we have preopening and then -- preopening costs and startup losses. And it's probably a bit more of a drag at the net income line as the depreciation and interest associated with that facility comes online. We'll probably lose a few million dollars next year on the foreign exchange impact in U.K. We probably will lose a few million dollars on a decline in, what we call, special Medicaid reimbursement monies, which will be UPL and disproportionate share on provider taxes. And I think the only other sort of probably noteworthy item about our guidance is that as has always been our historical practice, we assume that our free cash flow is dedicated to the repayment of debt. And all -- the only sort of share repurchase or other deployment of capital that we build into our guidance and build into our model is that, which has already occurred. And so I think it's a fairly conservative way of thinking about 2016 capital deployment because repayment of debt at the moment is the least accretive of all of our capital deployment options."

I mean, I would point out, A.J., that I think one of the drivers of the somewhat softer behavioral revenues in Q4 was a pretty difficult comparison to last year, particularly on the volume side. I think same-store admissions, behavioral admissions in the fourth quarter of last year were up 6.8%. And so I think we always knew that was going be a tough nut to compare to in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, as you alluded to, we have talked in the last quarter or 2 about the fact that in some of our markets, and I think the national data is supportive of this as well, we're facing a shortage, to some degree, of psychiatrists in many cases and, in some cases, nursing and other clinical professionals. And again, in some markets, that's causing us to not be able to treat all the patients who present themselves for admission, and it mutes our volume and, ultimately, our revenue numbers in some of those markets. We feel like the 5% number that I have identified as being our embedded in our guidance, revenue guidance, for next year, is absolutely achievable. We are working our way through the shortages in many of these markets. The comparisons certainly become easier as the year goes on. Next year, I would suggest that, that 5% may be a little bit back-end-loaded as we work through the comparisons and work through some of the clinical shortages. But I think we feel like the number is eminently achievable."

And that trend reversed itself in Q4 where our -- while our overall uninsured admissions were up. They were up slightly slower than our overall admissions. So I think our payer mix seems to be settling in to a bit more of a stable environment in Q4.

We completed 2 reasonably sized behavioral deals in the back half of last year and continue to look at others into '16. We've commented that the landscape and the market for acute care deals that are, I think, more suitable in our minds for what has been historically our market profile of kind of more suburban, midsized urban markets, larger hospitals, larger hospital systems, seems more active. So it's always difficult to predict which of those deals or how many of those deals might ultimately prove to be actionable or executable. But we certainly feel like it is more active. But also, like many of you, I think, we have viewed the decline in our stock over the last couple of quarters as really not something that has been justified by the underlying fundamentals of the business, which we don't feel have changed very much over the last 6 months. And as a consequence, we feel that there's a degree of confidence in our underlying business and feel like the current valuations of our stock are compelling opportunity as well.

I'm not exactly sure why that is. Obviously, there is a great deal of focus and speculation that, that's oil and gas-related and driven. We tend not to be in markets that are directly impacted by the oil and gas business. So I'm not certain that, that's the main driver or the only driver for sure. But certainly, our Texas markets for the last several quarters have been underperforming the acute care average."

So let me address that, I think, both in terms of volume and price. And I'll make the comment, and I think we've been making this comment and expressing this view longer and probably more adamantly than some of our peers, Matt, as we've always found it difficult to precisely carve out our ACA experience and sort of separate out exactly what our ACA commercial experience and rates are versus our overall commercial experience. And I would say, we continue. And honestly, as the ACA has progressed and we're now well into our third year, I'd say, into our fourth year of it, I think that we find that even more difficult. But so my commentary is probably more about commercial rates just generally than about ACA rates, specifically. And that is, we don't see tremendous changes either in our rate of increase. I think our commercial rates of increase still average in the 6%, 6.5% range, varies, to some degree by contract, by market, but I think that's still our average. I don't think we're really seeing significant changes in other terms, in benefit plan design. We're not seeing an emphasis on narrow networks that I think we actually expected we would see more of, et cetera. So I think as we enter '16 and as we think about creating our model for '16, it is more of the same as much as anything."

So look, I think that your comment, Ralph, in the sense that I believe we're facing psychiatry shortages in specific markets because I think nationally, the data suggests that the number of new psychiatrists over the last decade have not kept up or have lagged the overall number of new doctors. So the percentage of psychiatrists is actually declining. And I agree with you. That is kind of a more structural issue. I believe the market tends to correct for that in that as the demand for psychiatrists increases, as psychiatrists' earnings increase, more and more people get attracted to the field. More and more practicing psychiatrists will choose to devote at least some of their hours to clinical activities rather than to academic or other activities. So I do think there is some market correction that goes on for all of this. In addition, I think -- and the trend, what my commentary about as being a transient problem, is really meant to imply that, I believe, we can pull levers in our markets to address the issue. We can more aggressively recruit for psychiatrists. We can bring psychiatrists into a market that has a shortage. Your comment that, that may cost us more money, and in fact, I think it does cost us more money if you look at one of the reasons I think that our behavioral margins have come under pressure is because the cost of acquiring psychiatrists has also gone up, in addition to there being some pressure on our volumes. And the other thing that I think we do in markets where the regulatory environment allows us to is we create physician extenders, nurses and other clinicians who can do some of the tasks that psychiatrists are sometimes asked to do. And that helps us as well in terms of not having enough psychiatrists. So we're doing all of those things and pulling all those levers and aggressively focused on the issue. And to some degree, I think our confidence that we are going to do those things better than some of our peers in our markets causes me to comment or to believe that this is a transient sort of issue that we can overcome."

We tended to be in markets that were disproportionately hurt by the recession and had higher unemployment rates. I think that a number of sell side folks did analyses during the recession of where unemployment was the highest. And when they compared the public companies, I think we often fared the worst during the sort of height of the recession in places like Las Vegas and Southern California, South Florida, South Texas. But what we suggested at that time, and we believed, was when the economy recovered and when those local market economies recovered, we would benefit disproportionately from those recoveries. And I think that has certainly been an element of what has happened over the course of the last few years. As Las Vegas has come, I would suggest roaring back. We really benefited from that, for example. But I think we also believe that in many of our markets, we are aggressively increasing our market share. Both Alan and I mentioned the fact that a big California market, which is Riverside County. We built a new hospital several years ago in the Las Vegas market. We're building a new hospital to open later this year. We continue to take those very obvious actions and other not-so-obvious actions to cement, enhance and increase our market share in most of our acute care markets. And I think we have done that fairly successfully over the last few years as well. So I think both of those dynamics are at play when you see the really robust and industry-leading acute care revenue growth that we've been putting up."

So actually, I think, as sort of the conversation and commentary has been so far in the call, the issue for us is not so much caution about the pricing environment, which, I think, actually has been fairly healthy. And I think even if you look at Q4, the 2.5% pricing growth on our revenue per day in behavioral is, quite frankly, as good as that and a little better than we expected. So that, I don't think, is the concern going into or the caution going into 2016. I think what we -- the caution is some of the volume pressures that we've seen over the last few quarters. And I think those volume pressures are manifested in a few different areas. The area that we talked about the most historically and certainly over the last few quarters has been length-of-stay compression, that even when we were posing really strong admission growth, length-of-stay compression was muting or diminishing that growth to a degree. I think the length-of-stay pressure is starting to alleviate some. And so we're hopeful that, that will continue. But the admissions office that we've seen as a result of again, 2 things. Very difficult comparisons in the beginning of '16, that, I think, clouds some of our guidance for the year; and then some of the issues we've had over the clinician shortages of we been talking about. And while, as I've said in my previous commentary, I think we can address those, it may take a quarter or 2. So I think that's really what has caused us to be a little more muted about our behavioral revenue growth. And obviously, in the long term, we think that the tailwinds for behavioral revenue growth have a lot of potential. We haven't really talked in this call about the potential for the IND exclusion being partially or fully lifted. But we believe that will occur. And when it does, that will provide an opportunity for sort of another step-up in behavioral volumes that we're likely to see not so much in '16, but in '17 and thereafter."

So to be perfectly candid, I think we struggled in Q3 with explaining the increase in uncompensated volumes. As you suggest, some of our peers offered explanations that included some level of disenrollment in the exchanges, as exchange participants found their previous going up, or they suggested that maybe some exchange participants had sort of gamed the system and enrolled to get certain care but then disenrolled when they got that care. Those explanations seemed reasonable, and we can sort of find of anecdotal examples within our own experiences to support those explanations, but don't really have the sort of vast database to really be able to validate them in any sort of pervasive our comprehensive way. And I think our fourth quarter experience would suggest that even if those explanations were valid in Q3, they didn't necessarily extend into Q4. The other sort of question you asked about, which, I think, we certainly would concur with the experience, I mean, we have seen that as the ACA has been implemented and as exchange plans have become more prevalent and many of them have sort of high deductible, high coinsurance components to them, that the level of -- or the amount of the bill due from the patient has gone up. And as a consequence, the level of bad debt on that portion of the bill has also gone up. We believe that our accounting for that change has been sort of real-time and current all along and has been reflected over the course of the last several years in our current results.

In terms of, I think, sort of forward-looking into just the early part of '16, I think -- and I think most of the surveys have sort of suggested this, that the end of '15 and the beginning of January were sort of slow from a volume perspective on the acute side. I think that may be attributable to the fact that it was a late starting and relatively slow flu season. But I would say, over the course of the last 6 weeks from the middle of January to the end of February, acute care activity, at least, at our hospitals, seems to be pretty robust and certainly doesn't give us any pause about being able to continue to achieve the numbers that we identified before."

And I think on the surgical side, surgical volumes are up overall in Q4. We've returned a little bit more to what we've been seeing the historical pattern where, I think, out-patient volumes are up like 4% and in-patient volumes are up 2%. We went through a few quarters where in-patient was actually outpacing out-patient. Now it's really contributing to some very strong revenue and revenue acuity. This is a bit more normalized, but again, in the end, still helping us put up 7% acute care revenue growth, which we're quite pleased with."

So foundations, which was a behavioral acquisition that we did in October of last year, really, from our perspective, was intended to enhance our presence in addiction recovery business. UHS has been in the addiction recovery business press long as we've been in the behavioral business for 30-plus years. But the foundations model, business model, is a bit different. It's a bit more of an out-of-network model, although it's a fairly balanced in an out of network sort of source of patients. And it's much more of a direct-to-consumer marketing sort of model than our traditional referral-based model. And what we thought is that the foundations approach and the foundations infrastructure and their very nuanced patient capture system, and technology that they have would be a nice complement, both to our existing addiction treatment businesses as well as to other like diagnosis businesses, things like autism and eating disorders. And I think that's really the way it's shaping up. So I think that the early results from foundations are good, and they're encouraging. But I think what we're really most excited about is really sort of taking the best of both of our models, if you will, and sort of combining them, not only in the addiction business, but in some of these other similar diagnoses and service line businesses. And we think the real payoff is further down the road."

That's a huge change and a huge change in the requirements and the expertise of running acute care hospitals.

I think there are a whole host of changes that hospitals will have to make. And some hospitals, certainly not all, but some hospitals, I think, are deciding that they prefer to have help, either greater expertise or greater capital infusion or some combination of both, as they embark on those challenges.

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. 
During the conference call Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $6.76 for the year and $1.74 for the quarter. After adjusting for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as well as the other items attributable to last year's fourth quarter as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 12% to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $152 million or $1.51 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues, less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense, divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.1% and 27.9% during the quarters ended December 31, 2015, and '14, respectively. 
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 7.3% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions increased 4.8% while revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.3%. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 16.8% during the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015 as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014. This small decrease is primarily attributable to $199 million unfavorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting mainly from the timing of disbursements. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 52 days during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 54 days during the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45%. We spent $110 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $379 million during the full year of 2015. During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $425 million on capital expenditures which include expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.
In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 478,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we purchased an additional 887,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $99 million. $77 million remains on the previous authorization and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an additional $400 million in share repurchases. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016, is $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.17 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2016, as described in our press release. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 4% to 10% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $6.87 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule included in last night's press release. During 2016, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $9.75 billion to $9.85 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over 2015 net revenues. 
We are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think we've been fairly transparent over the course of the last few months in talking about our outlook for next year. In terms of the 2 segments, I think on the acute side we see revenue growth of about 6% next year in the acute division same-store. On the behavioral side, probably a little bit lower, maybe 5%. I think the acute care 6% is split fairly evenly between price and volume. And I think the behavioral 5% is probably weighted a little more towards volume rather than to price. And I think in both divisions, we expect margins to increase slightly if we can achieve those revenue growth levels. In terms of unusual items or other things that are sort of not included in what I just went through, we have talked for many quarters now that we will be opening a new sixth acute care hospital in Las Vegas. We estimate that to occur in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. That's probably a $5 million to $10 million EBITDA drag on the back half of next year as we have preopening and then -- preopening costs and startup losses. And it's probably a bit more of a drag at the net income line as the depreciation and interest associated with that facility comes online. We'll probably lose a few million dollars next year on the foreign exchange impact in the U.K. We'll probably lose a few million dollars on a decline in what we call special Medicaid reimbursement monies, which would be UPL and disproportionate share on provider taxes. And I think the only other sort of probably noteworthy item about our guidance is that as -- it's always been our historical practice, we assume that our free cash flow is dedicated to the repayment of debt. And all -- the only sort of share repurchase or other deployment of capital that we built into our guidance and built into our model is that which has already occurred. And so I think it's a fairly conservative way of thinking about 2016 capital deployment because repayment of debt at the moment is the least accretive of all of our capital deployment options."

I think same-store admissions, behavioral admissions in the fourth quarter of last year were up 6.8%. And so I think we always knew that was going be a tough nut to compare to -- in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, as you alluded to we have talked in the last quarter or 2 about the fact that in some of our markets, and I think the national data is supportive of this as well, we're facing a shortage to some degree of psychiatrists, in many cases and in some cases, nursing and other clinical professionals. And again, in some markets, that's causing us to not be able to treat all the patients who present themselves for admission and it mutes our volume and ultimately, our revenue numbers in some of those markets. We feel like the 5% number that I have identified as being our -- embedded in our guidance, revenue guidance for next year, is absolutely achievable. We are working our way through the shortages in many of these markets. The comparison has certainly become easier as the year goes on next year. I would suggest that, that 5% may be a little bit back-end loaded as we work through the comparisons and work through some of the clinical shortages, but I think we feel like the number is eminently achievable."

We've commented that the landscape and the market for acute care deals that are, I think, more suitable in our minds for what has been historically our market profile of kind of more suburban, midsized urban markets, larger hospitals, larger hospital systems, seems more active. It's always difficult to predict which of those deals or how many of those deals might ultimately prove to be actionable or executable, but we certainly feel like it is more active. But also, like many of you, I think we have viewed the decline in our stock over the last couple of quarters as really not something that has been justified by the underlying fundamentals of the business, which we don't feel have changed very much over the last 6 months. And as a consequence, we feel that their degree of confidence in our underlying business and feel like the current valuations of our stock are compelling opportunity as well.

But -- so my commentary is probably more about commercial rates just generally than about ACA rates, specifically. And that is, we don't see tremendous changes either in our rate of increase. I think our commercial rates of increase still average in the 6%, 6.5% range, varies to some degree by contract, by market, but I think that's still our average.

So look, I think that your comment, Ralph, in the sense that I believe we're facing psychiatrists shortages in specific markets because I think, nationally, the data suggests that the number of new psychiatrists over the last decade have not kept up or have lagged the overall number of new doctors, so the percentage of psychiatrists is actually declining. And I agree with you, that is a kind of more structural issue. I believe the market tends to correct for that. And that as the demand for psychiatrists increases, as psychiatrists' earnings increase, more and more people get attracted to the field. More and more practicing psychiatrists will choose to devote at least some of their hours to clinical activities rather than to academic or other activities. So I do think there is some market correction that goes on for all of this. In addition, I think -- and the trend -- what my commentary about as being a transient problem is really meant to imply that, I believe, we can pull levers in our markets to address the issue. We can more aggressively recruit for psychiatrists. We can bring psychiatrists into a market that has a shortage. Your comment that, that may costs us more money, and in fact, I think it does costs us more money if you look at one of the reasons I think that our behavioral margins have come under pressure is because the cost of acquiring psychiatrists has also gone up, in addition to there being some pressure on our volumes. And the other thing that I think we do in markets where the regulatory environment allows us to is we create physician extenders, nurses and other clinicians who can do some of the tasks that psychiatrists are sometimes asked to do. And that helps us as well in terms of not having enough psychiatrists. So we're doing all of those things and pulling all those levers and aggressively focused on the issue. And to some degree, I think our confidence that we're going to do those things better than some of our peers in our markets causes me to comment or to believe that this is a transient sort of issue that we can overcome."

And when they compared to public companies, I think we often fared the worst during the sort of height of the recession in places like Las Vegas and Southern California, South Florida, South Texas. But what we suggested at the time and we believed, was that when the economy recovered and when those local market economies recovered, we would benefit disproportionately from those recoveries. And I think that has certainly been an element of what has happened over the course of the last few years. As Las Vegas has come, I would suggest roaring back, we've really benefited from that, for example. But I think we also believe that in many of our markets, we are aggressively increasing our market share. Both Alan and I mentioned the fact that a big California market, which is Riverside County, we built a new hospital several years ago. In the Las Vegas market, we're building a new hospital to open later this year. We continue to take those very obvious actions and other not-so-obvious actions to cement, enhance and increase our market share in most of our acute care markets. And I think we have done that fairly successfully over the last few years as well. So I think both of those dynamics are at play when you see the really robust and industry-leading acute care revenue growth that we've been putting up."

So actually, I think, as sort of the conversation and commentary has been so far in the call, the issue for us is not so much caution about the pricing environment which I think actually has been fairly healthy. And I think even if you look at Q4, the 2.5% pricing growth on our revenue per day in behavioral is, quite frankly, as good as -- and a little better than we expected. So that, I don't think, is the concern going into or the caution, I should say the caution going into 2016. I think what we -- the caution is some of the volume pressures that we've seen over the last few quarters. And I think those volume pressures are manifested in a few different areas. The area that we talked about the most historically and certainly over the last few quarters has been length-of-stay compression, that even when we were posing really strong admission growth, length-of-stay compression was muting or diminishing that growth to a degree. I think the length-of-stay pressure is starting to alleviate some and so we're hopeful that will continue, but the admissions softness that we've seen as a result of, again, 2 things. Very difficult comparisons in the beginning of '16 that, I think, clouds some of our guidance for the year and then some of the issues we've had over the clinician shortages that we've been talking about. And while, as I've said in my previous commentary, I think we can address those, it may take a quarter or 2. So I think that's really what has caused us to be a little more muted about our behavioral revenue growth. And obviously, in the long term, we think that the tailwinds for behavioral revenue growth have a lot of potential. We haven't really talked in this call about the potential for the IMD exclusion being partially or fully lifted, but we believe that will occur. And when it does, that will provide an opportunity for sort of another step-up in behavioral volumes that we're likely to see not so much in '16, but in '17 and thereafter."

So to be perfectly candid, I think we've struggled in Q3 with explaining the increase in uncompensated volumes. As you suggest, some of our peers offered explanations that included some level of disenrollment in the exchanges, as exchange participants found their premiums going up or they suggested that maybe some exchange participants have sort of game the system and enrolled to get certain care but then disenrolled when they got that care. Those explanations seemed reasonable and we could sort of find anecdotal examples within our own experience to support those explanations, but don't really have the sort of vast database to really be able to validate them in any sort of pervasive our comprehensive way. And I think our fourth quarter experience would suggest that even if those explanations were valid in Q3, they didn't necessarily extend into Q4. The other sort of question you asked about which I think we certainly would concur with the experience, I mean we have seen that as the ACA has been implemented and as exchange plans have become more prevalent and many of them have sort of high deductible, high coinsurance components to them, that the level of -- or the amount of the bill due from the patient has gone up. And as a consequence, the level of bad debt on that portion of the bill has also gone up. We believe that our accounting for that change has been sort of real-time and current all along and has been reflected over the course of the last several years in our current results. So I don't feel like we feel like there's any sort of catch-up required in the way that we're recognizing that phenomena for financial statement purposes."

In terms of, I think sort of forward-looking into just the early part of '16, I think -- and I think most of the surveys have sort of suggested this, that the end of '15 and the beginning of January were sort of slow from a volume perspective on the acute side. I think that may be attributable to the fact that it was a late starting and relatively slow flu season. But I would say over the course of the last 6 weeks from the middle of January to the end of February, acute care activity, at least in our hospitals, seems to be pretty robust and certainly doesn't give us any pause about being able to continue to achieve the numbers that we identified before."

And it's much more of a direct-to-consumer marketing sort of model than our traditional referral-based model.

That's a huge change and a huge change in the requirements and the expertise of running acute care hospitals. And I think a lot of the hospitals that we talked to worry about their ability to compete in that sort of new landscape either from a physical facility perspective, an information technology perspective, a relationship with physician perspective. I think there are a whole host of changes that hospitals will have to make. And some hospitals, certainly not all, but some hospitals I think are deciding that they prefer to have help either greater expertise or greater capital infusion or some combination of both as they embark on those challenges. And in my mind, that's probably what's driving this increased level of interest and activity."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. 
During the conference call Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $6.76 for the year and $1.74 for the quarter. After adjusting for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as well as the other items attributable to last year's fourth quarter as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 12% to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $152 million or $1.51 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues, less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense, divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.1% and 27.9% during the quarters ended December 31, 2015, and '14, respectively. 
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 7.3% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions increased 4.8% while revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.3%. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 16.8% during the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015 as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014. This small decrease is primarily attributable to $199 million unfavorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting mainly from the timing of disbursements. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 52 days during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 54 days during the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45%. We spent $110 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $379 million during the full year of 2015. During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $425 million on capital expenditures which include expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.
In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 478,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we purchased an additional 887,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $99 million. $77 million remains on the previous authorization and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an additional $400 million in share repurchases. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016, is $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.17 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2016, as described in our press release. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 4% to 10% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $6.87 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule included in last night's press release. During 2016, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $9.75 billion to $9.85 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over 2015 net revenues. 
We are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think we've been fairly transparent over the course of the last few months in talking about our outlook for next year. In terms of the 2 segments, I think on the acute side we see revenue growth of about 6% next year in the acute division same-store. On the behavioral side, probably a little bit lower, maybe 5%. I think the acute care 6% is split fairly evenly between price and volume. And I think the behavioral 5% is probably weighted a little more towards volume rather than to price. And I think in both divisions, we expect margins to increase slightly if we can achieve those revenue growth levels. In terms of unusual items or other things that are sort of not included in what I just went through, we have talked for many quarters now that we will be opening a new sixth acute care hospital in Las Vegas. We estimate that to occur in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. That's probably a $5 million to $10 million EBITDA drag on the back half of next year as we have preopening and then -- preopening costs and startup losses. And it's probably a bit more of a drag at the net income line as the depreciation and interest associated with that facility comes online. We'll probably lose a few million dollars next year on the foreign exchange impact in the U.K. We'll probably lose a few million dollars on a decline in what we call special Medicaid reimbursement monies, which would be UPL and disproportionate share on provider taxes. And I think the only other sort of probably noteworthy item about our guidance is that as has always been our historical practice, we assume that our free cash flow is dedicated to the repayment of debt. And all -- the only sort of share repurchase or other deployment of capital that we built into our guidance and built into our model is that which has already occurred. And so I think it's a fairly conservative way of thinking about 2016 capital deployment because repayment of debt at the moment is the least accretive of all of our capital deployment options."

I mean, I would point out, A.J., that I think one of the drivers of the somewhat softer behavioral revenues in Q4 was a pretty difficult comparison to last year, particularly on the volume side. I think same-store admissions, behavioral admissions in the fourth quarter of last year were up 6.8%. And so I think we always knew that was going be a tough nut to compare to in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, as you alluded to we have talked in the last quarter or 2 about the fact that in some of our markets, and I think the national data is supportive of this as well, we're facing a shortage to some degree of psychiatrists, in many cases and in some cases, nursing and other clinical professionals. And again, in some markets, that's causing us to not be able to treat all the patients who present themselves for admission and it mutes our volume and ultimately, our revenue numbers in some of those markets. We feel like the 5% number that I have identified as being our -- embedded in our guidance, revenue guidance for next year, is absolutely achievable. We are working our way through the shortages in many of these markets. The comparison's certainly become easier as the year goes on next year. I would suggest that, that 5% may be a little bit back-end loaded as we work through the comparisons and work through some of the clinical shortages, but I think we feel like the number is eminently achievable."

Our uninsured admission growth in Q4 actually slowed a little bit. In Q3, our uninsured admission growth was tracking ahead of our overall admission growth. And that trend reversed itself in Q4 where our -- while our overall uninsured admissions were up, they were up slightly slower than our overall admissions. So I think our payer mix seems to be settling in to a bit more of the stable environment in Q4. And again, I think we're just pleased, extremely pleased, that the overall, even after uncompensated care is included, 7-plus percent growth in acute care revenues in Q4."

We completed 2 reasonably sized behavioral deals in the back half of last year and continue to look at others into '16. We've commented that the landscape and the market for acute care deals that are, I think, more suitable in our minds for what has been historically our market profile of kind of more suburban, midsized urban markets, larger hospitals, larger hospital systems, seems more active. It's always difficult to predict which of those deals or how many of those deals might ultimately prove to be actionable or executable, but we certainly feel like it is more active. But also, like many of you, I think we have viewed the decline in our stock over the last couple of quarters as really not something that has been justified by the underlying fundamentals of the business, which we don't feel have changed very much over the last 6 months. And as a consequence, we feel that their degree of confidence in our underlying business and feel like the current valuations of our stock are a compelling opportunity as well.

And I would say, we continue. And honestly, as the ACA has progressed and we're now well into our third year, I'd say into our fourth year of it, I think that we find that even more difficult. But -- so my commentary is probably more about commercial rates just generally than about ACA rates, specifically. And that is, we don't see tremendous changes either in our rate of increase. I think our commercial rates of increase still average in the 6%, 6.5% range, varies to some degree by contract, by market, but I think that's still our average. And I don't think we're really seeing significant changes in other terms, in benefit plan design.

So look, I think that your comment, Ralph, in the sense that I believe we're facing psychiatrist shortages in specific markets because I think, nationally, the data suggests that the number of new psychiatrists over the last decade have not kept up or have lagged the overall number of new doctors, so the percentage of psychiatrists is actually declining. And I agree with you, that is a kind of more structural issue. I believe the market tends to correct for that, in that as the demand for psychiatrists increases, as psychiatrists' earnings increase, more and more people get attracted to the field. More and more practicing psychiatrists will choose to devote at least some of their hours to clinical activities rather than to academic or other activities. So I do think there is some market correction that goes on for all of this. In addition, I think -- and the trend -- what my commentary about as being a transient problem is really meant to imply that, I believe, we can pull levers in our markets to address the issue. We can more aggressively recruit for psychiatrists. We can bring psychiatrists into a market that has a shortage. Your comment that, that may cost us more money, and in fact, I think it does cost us more money if you look at one of the reasons I think that our behavioral margins have come under pressure is because the cost of acquiring psychiatrists has also gone up, in addition to there being some pressure on our volumes. And the other thing that I think we do in markets where the regulatory environment allows us to is we create physician extenders, nurses and other clinicians who can do some of the tasks that psychiatrists are sometimes asked to do. And that helps us as well in terms of not having enough psychiatrists. So we're doing all of those things and pulling all those levers and aggressively focused on the issue. And to some degree, I think our confidence that we're going to do those things better than some of our peers in our markets causes me to comment or to believe that this is a transient sort of issue that we can overcome."

We tended to be in markets that were disproportionately hurt by the recession and had higher unemployment rates. I think that a number of sell side folks did analyses during the recession of where unemployment was the highest. And when they compared the public companies, I think we often fared the worst during the sort of height of the recession in places like Las Vegas and Southern California, South Florida, South Texas. But what we suggested at the time and we believed, was that when the economy recovered and when those local market economies recovered, we would benefit disproportionately from those recoveries. And I think that has certainly been an element of what has happened over the course of the last few years. As Las Vegas has come, I would suggest roaring back, we've really benefited from that, for example. But I think we also believe that in many of our markets, we are aggressively increasing our market share. Both Alan and I mentioned the fact that a big California market, which is Riverside County, we built a new hospital several years ago. In the Las Vegas market, we're building a new hospital to open later this year. We continue to take those very obvious actions and other not-so-obvious actions to cement, enhance and increase our market share in most of our acute care markets. And I think we have done that fairly successfully over the last few years as well. So I think both of those dynamics are at play when you see the really robust and industry-leading acute care revenue growth that we've been putting up."

So actually, I think, as sort of the conversation and commentary has been so far in the call, the issue for us is not so much caution about the pricing environment which I think actually has been fairly healthy. And I think even if you look at Q4, the 2.5% pricing growth on our revenue per day in behavioral is, quite frankly, as good as -- and a little better than we expected. So that, I don't think is the concern going into -- or the caution -- I should say the caution going into 2016. I think what we -- the caution is some of the volume pressures that we've seen over the last few quarters. And I think those volume pressures are manifested in a few different areas. The area that we talked about the most historically and certainly over the last few quarters has been length-of-stay compression, that even when we were posing really strong admission growth, length-of-stay compression was muting or diminishing that growth to a degree. I think the length-of-stay pressure is starting to alleviate some and so we're hopeful that will continue, but the admissions softness that we've seen as a result of, again, 2 things. Very difficult comparisons in the beginning of '16. That, I think, clouds some of our guidance for the year and then some of the issues we've had over the clinician shortages that we've been talking about. And while, as I've said in my previous commentary, I think we can address those, it may take a quarter or 2. So I think that's really what has caused us to be a little more muted about our behavioral revenue growth. And obviously, in the long term, we think that the tailwinds for behavioral revenue growth have a lot of potential. We haven't really talked in this call about the potential for the IMD exclusion being partially or fully lifted, but we believe that will occur. And when it does, that will provide an opportunity for sort of another step-up in behavioral volumes that we're likely to see not so much in '16, but in '17 and thereafter."

So to be perfectly candid, I think we've struggled in Q3 with explaining the increase in uncompensated volumes. As you suggest, some of our peers offered explanations that included some level of disenrollment in the exchanges, as exchange participants found their premiums going up or they suggested that maybe some exchange participants have sort of gamed the system and enrolled to get certain care but then disenrolled when they got that care. Those explanations seemed reasonable and we could sort of find anecdotal examples within our own experience to support those explanations, but don't really have the sort of vast database to really be able to validate them in any sort of pervasive or comprehensive way. And I think our fourth quarter experience would suggest that even if those explanations were valid in Q3, they didn't necessarily extend into Q4. The other sort of question you asked about, which I think we certainly would concur with the experience, I mean we have seen that as the ACA has been implemented and as exchange plans have become more prevalent and many of them have sort of high deductible, high coinsurance components to them, that the level of -- or the amount of the bill due from the patient has gone up. And as a consequence, the level of bad debt on that portion of the bill has also gone up. We believe that our accounting for that change has been sort of real-time and current all along and has been reflected over the course of the last several years in our current results. So I don't feel like we feel like there's any sort of catch-up required in the way that we're recognizing that phenomena for financial statement purposes."

As you saw the 4Q trends on both volumes and on acuity and then coming into the first quarter, anything you're seeing in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter from a seasonality perspective or the acuity or types of procedures and services that would tell us what the drivers of that volume growth is?"

So just to go back, Ana, I would say that what my answer before was really meant to say that I think our acute care revenues, in general, are benefiting from both the improvement in our end-market economies as well as the ACA benefit. And honestly, I think sometimes it's difficult for us to distinguish precisely between the two and market share gains as well. So again, I think all those dynamics are contributing. In terms of, I think sort of forward-looking into just the early part of '16, I think -- and I think most of the surveys have sort of suggested this, that the end of '15 and the beginning of January were sort of slow from a volume perspective on the acute side. I think that may be attributable to the fact that it was a late starting and relatively slow flu season. But I would say over the course of the last 6 weeks from the middle of January to the end of February, acute care activity, at least at our hospitals, seems to be pretty robust and certainly doesn't give us any pause about being able to continue to achieve the numbers that we identified before."

UHS has been in the addiction recovery business for as long as we've been in the behavioral business for 30-plus years. But the Foundations model, business model, is a bit different. It's a bit more of an out-of-network model, although it's a fairly balanced in and out of network sort of source of patients. And it's much more of a direct-to-consumer marketing sort of model than our traditional referral-based model. And what we thought is that the Foundations' approach and the Foundations' infrastructure and their very nuanced patient capture system and technology that they have, would be a nice complement both to our existing addiction treatment businesses as well as to other like-diagnosis businesses, things like autism and eating disorders. And I think that's really the way it's shaping up. So I think that the early results from Foundations are good and they're encouraging.

We've invested in physical facilities and kind of continuing on to what I was saying to John and upgrading our outpatient capabilities in particular. We've acquired a number of outpatient facilities in our markets over the last few years. So again, in the context of having a few more minutes to sort of talk about it, I'd love to sort of talk about maybe some of the individual strategies and individual markets. But suffice it to say at this point, that I think it's a sort of multi-pronged approach in each of our markets."

And so it would not be surprising to me if the recovery in those same markets was over a similar period. And we're probably 3 years or so in most of these markets into the recovery.

We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS for diluted share of $1.93 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.98 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
On the same facility basis in our acute division revenues increased 12% during the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a 7.8% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.
On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.1% during the first quarter of 2016, from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2015. 
On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.5% during the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.4% and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% over the prior-year our first quarter. 
Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.2% during the first quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 28.4% during the comparable prior year period.
Our cash provided by operating activities increased 71% to approximately $464 million during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $271 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 51 days during the first quarter of 2016, and our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 43.3% at March 31, 2016 as compared to 44.6% at March 31, 2015.
We spent $127 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter, we opened a total of 182 new behavioral health beds, including 57 [ph] beds opened at a new de novo hospital located in Oklahoma and 125 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. Many behavioral health construction projects are underway, including 6 new de novo hospitals totaling 562 beds. 
In February of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million. In conjunction with this program during the first quarter of 2016 we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $152 million or approximately $113 per share. 
Since the inception of the program through March 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $377 million or approximately $117 per share.
Alan and I will be pleased to answer questions at this time."

They met our expectations and our behavioral results in general were very much in line with our budget for the quarter. But we continue to face both psychiatrists, nursing and other clinician shortages in some of our markets. And in some cases, that is muting or depressing our -- what would otherwise we think be higher demand and higher volumes. We had a number of initiatives in place to try and rectify those dynamics in those situations. And we believe, as we said at the end of the year, that our behavioral revenue growth should increase as the year goes on as those comparisons become easier and some of those initiatives begin to get more traction."

But in terms of overall revenue, it's a little bit harder to do. Obviously however you slice it, the revenue growth in the acute care division for the quarter was extremely strong and well in excess of the 6% revenue growth that we anticipated in our guidance and in our budget for the year. Again, I think it's difficult to parse that growth out into individual pieces. We still continue to get some benefit from the ACA and expanded Medicaid enrollment and new commercial exchange enrollment, although certainly that benefit is diminishing. And now that we're into its third year, we continue to benefit as our markets improve economically and that certainly continues as well. But I think one of the most encouraging aspects of the quarter from our perspective is the single the biggest admission growth for us was in our Medicare payer class. And in theory, Medicare patients are probably largely unimpacted by both the ACA dynamics and by an improving economy. And so I think what that's reflective of is just general strength of the franchises that we're operating in our local markets and the initiatives that our operators have put in place for some time now to create more and more physician integration in our markets to focus on really important service lines to us, like orthopedics and cardiology, and to really just focus on business development. I think that we have had for 4 or 5 quarters among the industry-leading admissions from an acute care perspective. And while I know the other companies have yet to report, my guess is we'll certainly be in that position again this quarter."

Generally, however, I would just sort of comment that many of the trends that we've remarked on in recent quarters have remained in place. You alluded to the fact that our Vegas market has been performing quite well and that continued into Q1. Our Southern California market has also performed very well. Our Temecula Hospital, which is now in its third year of operation is performing particularly well, and that's driving some very strong numbers out of Riverside County, California. Washington, DC has been a strong market for us and wasn't in Q1. We see some weakness in the South Texas markets which we remarked on previously.

And we, like the others in the freestanding behavioral industry, view the lifting of the IMD exclusion certainly as a positive development, albeit one that will show its impact or reflect its impact gradually over time. It will require some effort to get access to this patient population. And I think we've always said it's difficult to quantify what the potential benefits will be at the outset. But we, I think, share what is generally a consensus view that the benefit and what is the potential benefit is significant. I'll also make the point  and I know we talked about this a number of times previously that we view the lifting on the IMD exclusion and our ability to take these patients that have previously been seen in acute care hospitals in behavioral units in a broader context of trying to integrate with the behavioral units in acute care hospitals in our markets for all their patients. We have opened, over the course of the last few years, a number of leased units that -- leased behavioral units that we're leasing from some big, not-for-profit acute care hospital systems around the country. We have a number of other similar conversations underway to accomplish the same thing. And while the lifting of the IMD exclusion might help accelerate and expedite those conversations, because now we can treat adult Medicaid patients as well, most of those conversations are even broader than that and include Medicare patients, they include commercial patients. And frankly, we view that overall as one of the most significant business development opportunities for our behavioral hospitals over the course of the next few years. So it's an important development, but I think one that fits into a really kind of an overall strategy that we're extremely enthusiastic about."

And then the second half of the year would become easier to achieve the 5% and probably exceed it as the comparisons became easier and those initiatives got traction.

So I mean If you go back and look, you will see that our occupancy percentage in the behavioral business in that sort of high 70s, 76%, 77% range, has really been very consistent, I would say, for the last 7 or 8 years. And what that means is that during that period, we've been adding beds fairly aggressively. And obviously the implication is we're filling those beds as quickly as we're adding them and maintaining our occupancy percentage. The reason we're adding beds with the 76% occupancy level is because in markets and in situations, we're clearly turning away patients because of volume constraints. And the economics of it are such that after you turned away more than just a handful of patients it almost always make sense to add beds. And so we continue to do that. I will say that in my remarks were talked about for instance the de novo development projects, those projects are undertaken really without regard to the IMD exclusion. Obviously, these have gone under development for some time. And so those projects are all in our minds justified by the demand in those markets regardless of whether or not there is sort of incremental demand associated with the IMD. So as I said, I mean in some way I think those are set of discrete kind of activity. I think we think what the overall demand for behavior has been strong, continues to be strong. We're going to add this to make that. And at the same time, the going to continue these conversations with acute care hospitals in our markets to get access to their behavioral patients and all their behavioral patients, not just an adult Medicaid patients, but their commercially and their Medicare and any other patients as well."

Obviously, we are in some markets that were hit fairly hard during the recession 3 or 4 years ago. Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida had disproportionately higher unemployment rates than national averages, et cetera. So as those markets have recovered, I think we have benefited economically, disproportionately perhaps than some of our peers. But I think at the same time and I think the strong start to 2016 really belies this idea that as the ACA benefit has really sort of largely anniversary-ed itself as the economic improvement has largely anniversary-ed itself, I think what you're seeing at the beginning of 2016 is the strengthening of our franchise is in those now very healthy markets, et cetera. We've been working a lot over the last few years to shore up our physician relationships and our physician integration arrangements, acquiring practices and integrating in other ways, focusing on service lines. And I think that's already starting to pay dividends. And again I'll highlight what I did earlier in an earlier response, which is when that growth is in Medicare, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we're probably gaining market share. Since that, that's not a patient population that is inherently growing or seeing more demand, et cetera.

So obviously, I think beyond the volume strength, which we've already commented on, we're seeing a lot of sort of high-quality revenue and high acuity revenue strength as well. On the behavioral side, I will say, I mean the one sort of issue between the acute and the residential business is, the residential business is not subject, I think, nearly as much to this whole psychiatry shortage issue.

And again, we're set of approaching this in kind of 2 phase process. I mean the one as I stress is we would like to reach collaborative agreements with many of the acute care hospitals in our markets that are providing inpatient behavioral services. We think, generally, and this is certainly not true of any single acute care hospital. But we think generally, acute care hospital are not very good providers. They're not efficient providers of behavioral services. They have so many other things that they're doing that it's just not a top priority of theirs. And we generally feel we can do it better, we can with higher quality conflict with better efficiency and we're trying to make that argument acute care colleagues and markets around the country. I think in our minds, that's sort of the first step in getting access to these adult Medicaid patients. The second is more I think along the lines of what you're suggesting which is as a freestanding industry and certainly UHS I think has the ability to be able to provide these services more efficiently, and at both high-quality and lower costs, then we're certainly prepared to make those arguments into our managed care payer. But quite frankly, I think as you are aware of that dynamic as we are with the rest of their patient population. So that is a secondary argument. We'd like to get the acute hospitals to sort of partner with us first and then we'll kind of make our pitch to the MCOs."

We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS for diluted share of $1.93 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.98 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
On the same facility basis in our acute division revenues increased 12% during the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a 7.8% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.
On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.1% during the first quarter of 2016, from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2015. 
On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.5% during the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.4% and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% over the prior-year our first quarter. 
Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.2% during the first quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 28.4% during the comparable prior year period.
Our cash provided by operating activities increased 71% to approximately $464 million during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $271 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 51 days during the first quarter of 2016, and our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 43.3% at March 31, 2016 as compared to 44.6% at March 31, 2015.
We spent $127 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter, we opened a total of 182 new behavioral health beds, including 57 [ph] beds opened at a new de novo hospital located in Oklahoma and 125 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. Many behavioral health construction projects are underway, including 6 new de novo hospitals totaling 562 beds. 
In February of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million. In conjunction with this program during the first quarter of 2016 we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $152 million or approximately $113 per share. 
Since the inception of the program through March 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $377 million or approximately $117 per share.
Alan and I will be pleased to answer questions at this time."

They met our expectations and our behavioral results in general were very much in line with our budget for the quarter. But we continue to face both psychiatrists, nursing and other clinician shortages in some of our markets. And in some cases, that is muting or depressing our -- what would otherwise we think be higher demand and higher volumes. We had a number of initiatives in place to try and rectify those dynamics in those situations. And we believe, as we said at the end of the year, that our behavioral revenue growth should increase as the year goes on as those comparisons become easier and some of those initiatives begin to get more traction."

But in terms of overall revenue, it's a little bit harder to do. Obviously however you slice it, the revenue growth in the acute care division for the quarter was extremely strong and well in excess of the 6% revenue growth that we anticipated in our guidance and in our budget for the year. Again, I think it's difficult to parse that growth out into individual pieces. We still continue to get some benefit from the ACA and expanded Medicaid enrollment and new commercial exchange enrollment, although certainly that benefit is diminishing. And now that we're into its third year, we continue to benefit as our markets improve economically and that certainly continues as well. But I think one of the most encouraging aspects of the quarter from our perspective is the single the biggest admission growth for us was in our Medicare payer class. And in theory, Medicare patients are probably largely unimpacted by both the ACA dynamics and by an improving economy. And so I think what that's reflective of is just general strength of the franchises that we're operating in our local markets and the initiatives that our operators have put in place for some time now to create more and more physician integration in our markets to focus on really important service lines to us, like orthopedics and cardiology, and to really just focus on business development. I think that we have had for 4 or 5 quarters among the industry-leading admissions from an acute care perspective. And while I know the other companies have yet to report, my guess is we'll certainly be in that position again this quarter."

You alluded to the fact that our Vegas market has been performing quite well and that continued into Q1. Our Southern California market has also performed very well. Our Temecula Hospital, which is now in its third year of operation is performing particularly well, and that's driving some very strong numbers out of Riverside County, California. Washington, DC has been a strong market for us and wasn't in Q1. We see some weakness in the South Texas markets which we remarked on previously.

And we, like the others in the freestanding behavioral industry, view the lifting of the IMD exclusion certainly as a positive development, albeit one that will show its impact or reflect its impact gradually over time. It will require some effort to get access to this patient population. And I think we've always said it's difficult to quantify what the potential benefits will be at the outset. But we, I think, share what is generally a consensus view that the benefit and what is the potential benefit is significant. I'll also make the point  and I know we talked about this a number of times previously that we view the lifting on the IMD exclusion and our ability to take these patients that have previously been seen in acute care hospitals in behavioral units in a broader context of trying to integrate with the behavioral units in acute care hospitals in our markets for all their patients.

And while the lifting of the IMD exclusion might help accelerate and expedite those conversations, because now we can treat adult Medicaid patients as well, most of those conversations are even broader than that and include Medicare patients, they include commercial patients. And frankly, we view that overall as one of the most significant business development opportunities for our behavioral hospitals over the course of the next few years. So it's an important development, but I think one that fits into a really kind of an overall strategy that we're extremely enthusiastic about."

So we can reach agreement with acute care hospitals in our markets to get access to those patients, whether we lease the beds or manage the units for joint venture to units where they close their units. But the presumption, I think, in our part and what has played out at least in our initial conversation is we will have access not only to those patients, but also that of the clinicians who are treating those patients. So it's not as if we will have an incremental need to higher staff to treat those patients. So can we move on to the next question?"

And then the second half of the year would become easier to achieve the 5% and probably exceed it as the comparisons became easier and those initiatives got traction.

And obviously the implication is we're filling those beds as quickly as we're adding them and maintaining our occupancy percentage. The reason we're adding beds with the 76% occupancy level is because in markets and in situations, we're clearly turning away patients because of volume constraints. And the economics of it are such that after you turned away more than just a handful of patients it almost always make sense to add beds. And so we continue to do that. I will say that in my remarks were talked about for instance the de novo development projects, those projects are undertaken really without regard to the IMD exclusion. Obviously, these have gone under development for some time. And so those projects are all in our minds justified by the demand in those markets regardless of whether or not there is sort of incremental demand associated with the IMD.

We've been working a lot over the last few years to shore up our physician relationships and our physician integration arrangements, acquiring practices and integrating in other ways, focusing on service lines. And I think that's already starting to pay dividends. And again I'll highlight what I did earlier in an earlier response, which is when that growth is in Medicare, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we're probably gaining market share. Since that, that's not a patient population that is inherently growing or seeing more demand, et cetera.

And so in a number of geographies and a number of instances, we already have existing managed care contracts for the adolescent Medicaid population. And we can either extend those contracts to the adult population or just modify them, et cetera It varies a little bit in every geography but I do not believe that contract increase of this whole line of exercise is the more difficult piece. I think and then is those conversations and hopefully those collaborative agreements with the acute care hospitals that are really at the crux of it."

What I was trying to allude to the board and maybe to [ph] nuance it, I think the idea that our Medicare population and admission is growing as quickly as it is, almost by definition that we're taking market share. Because while the overall Medicare population could be expanding somewhat, it is certainly not expanding at the pace our admissions are expanding. So I think almost by definition, the fact that our Medicare population is growing as much as it did is suggesting that in many of our markets, we are taking market share from our competitors.

I mean the one as I stress is we would like to reach collaborative agreements with many of the acute care hospitals in our markets that are providing inpatient behavioral services.

They're not efficient providers of behavioral services. They have so many other things that they're doing that it's just not a top priority of theirs. And we generally feel we can do it better, we can with higher quality conflict with better efficiency and we're trying to make that argument acute care colleagues and markets around the country. I think in our minds, that's sort of the first step in getting access to these adult Medicaid patients. The second is more I think along the lines of what you're suggesting which is as a freestanding industry and certainly UHS I think has the ability to be able to provide these services more efficiently, and at both high-quality and lower costs, then we're certainly prepared to make those arguments into our managed care payer. But quite frankly, I think as you are aware of that dynamic as we are with the rest of their patient population. So that is a secondary argument.

We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.93 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.98 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. On the same facility basis in our acute division revenues, increased 12% during the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a 7.8% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.1% during the first quarter of 2016 from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2015. On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.5% during the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.4%, and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% over the prior-year first quarter. 
Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.2% during the first quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.8% during the quarter, ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 28.4% during the comparable prior year period. Our cash provided by operating activities increased 71% to approximately $464 million during the first quarter of 2016, as compared to $271 million in the first quarter of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 51 days during the first quarter of 2016, and our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 43.3% at March 31, 2016 as compared to 44.6% at March 31, 2015. We spent $127 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter, we opened a total of 182 new behavioral health beds, including 57 beds opened at a new de novo hospital located in Oklahoma and 125 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. Many behavioral health construction projects are underway, including 6 new de novo hospitals totaling 562 beds. In February of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million. In conjunction with this program during the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $152 million or approximately $113 per share. 
Since the inception of the program through March 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $377 million or approximately $117 per share.
Alan and I will be pleased to answer questions at this time."

But in terms of overall revenue, it's a little bit harder to do. Obviously, however you slice it, the revenue growth in the acute care division for the quarter was extremely strong and well in excess of the 6% revenue growth that we anticipated in our guidance and in our budget for the year. Again, I think it's difficult to parse that growth out into individual pieces. We still continue to get some benefit from the ACA and expanded Medicaid enrollment and new commercial exchange enrollment, although, certainly, that benefit is diminishing. And now that we're into its third year, we continue to benefit, as our markets improve economically, and that certainly continues as well. But I think one of the most encouraging aspects of the quarter from our perspective is the single biggest admission growth for us was in our Medicare payer class. And in theory, Medicare patients are probably largely un-impacted by both the ACA dynamics and by an improving economy. And so I think what that's reflective of is just general strength of the franchises that we're operating in our local markets and the initiatives that our operators have put in place for some time now to create more and more physician integration in our markets to focus on really important service lines to us, like orthopedics and cardiology, and to really just focus on business development. I think that we have had for 4 or 5 quarters among the industry-leading admissions from an acute care perspective, and while I know the other companies have yet to report, my guess is we'll certainly be in that position again this quarter."

But we, I think, share what is generally a consensus view that the benefit and the potential benefit is significant. I'll also make the point and I know we've talked about this a number of times previously that we view the lifting of the IMD exclusion and our ability to take these patients that have previously been seen in acute care hospitals with behavioral units in a broader context of trying to integrate with the behavioral units in acute care hospitals in our markets for all their patients. We have opened, over the course of the last few years, a number of leased units that we are -- leased behavioral units that we are leasing from some big, not-for-profit acute care hospital systems around the country. We have a number of other similar conversations underway to accomplish the same thing. And while the lifting of the IMD exclusion might help accelerate and expedite those conversations, because now we can treat adult Medicaid patients as well, most of those conversations are even broader than that and include Medicare patients. They include commercial patients. And frankly, we view that overall as one of the most significant business development opportunities for our behavioral hospitals over the course of the next few years. So it's an important development, but I think one that fits into really kind of an overall strategy that we're extremely enthusiastic about."

And what that means is that during that period, we've been adding beds fairly aggressively, and obviously, the implication is we are filling those beds as quickly as we're adding them and maintaining our occupancy percentage. The reason we're adding beds with the 76% occupancy level is because in markets and in situations, we're clearly turning away patients because of volume constraints. And the economics of it are such that after you turned away more than just a handful of patients, it almost always make sense to add beds, and so we continue to do that. Now I will say that in my remarks where I talked about, for instance, the de novo development projects, those projects were undertaken really without regard to the IMD exclusion. Obviously, these been under development for some time. And so those projects are all in our minds justified by the demand in those markets, regardless of whether or not there is sort of incremental demand associated with the IMD.

So obviously, I think beyond the volume strength, which we've already commented on, we're seeing a lot of sort of high-quality revenue and high acuity revenue strength as well. On the behavioral side, I will say, I mean, the one sort of issue between the acute and the residential business is the residential business is not subject, I think, nearly as much to this whole psychiatry shortage issue. So the residential admissions have probably held in a little bit stronger than the acute admissions. And frankly, I think at least from a cosmetic perspective, that tends to hurt us because, at least, at the public companies, we tend to have a behavioral revenue sort of profile that is weighted more to the acute rather than to the residential business."

I mean, -- and again, I think we're sort of of approaching this in kind of a 2 phase sort of process. I mean the one, as I stressed, is we would like to reach collaborative agreements with many of the acute care hospitals in our markets that are providing inpatient behavioral services. We think, generally, and this is certainly not true of every single acute care hospital, but we think, generally, acute care hospitals are not very good providers. They're not efficient providers of behavioral services. They have so many other things that they're doing that it's just not a top priority of theirs, and we generally feel we can do it better. We can do it higher quality. We can do it with better efficiency, and we're trying to make that argument to our acute care colleagues, if you will, in our markets around the country. And I think, in our minds, that's sort of the first step in getting access to these adult Medicaid patients. The second is more, I think, along the lines of what you're suggesting which is as a freestanding industry, and certainly, UHS, I think, has a reputation of being able to provide these services more efficiently, and at both high-quality and lower cost, then we're certainly prepared to make those arguments into our managed care payers. But quite frankly, I think, are as aware of that dynamic as we are with the rest of their patient population. So that to us, I think, is more of a secondary argument. We'd like to get the acute hospitals sort of to partner with us first, and then we'll kind of make our pitch to the MCOs."

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.93 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.98 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. On the same facility basis in our acute division, revenues increased 12% during the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a 7.8% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.1% during the first quarter of 2016 from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2015. On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.5% during the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.4%, and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% over the prior-year first quarter. 
Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.2% during the first quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 28.4% during the comparable prior year period. Our cash provided by operating activities increased 71% to approximately $464 million during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $271 million in the first quarter of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 51 days during the first quarter of 2016, and our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 43.3% at March 31, 2016, as compared to 44.6% at March 31, 2015. We spent $127 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the first quarter, we opened a total of 182 new behavioral health beds, including 57 beds opened at a new de novo hospital located in Oklahoma and 125 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. Many behavioral health construction projects are under way, including 6 new de novo hospitals totaling 562 beds. In February of 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million. In conjunction with this program during the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $152 million or approximately $113 per share. 
Since the inception of the program through March 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $377 million or approximately $117 per share.
Alan and I will be pleased to answer questions at this time."

They met our expectations, and our behavioral results in general were very much in line with our budget for the quarter, but we continue to face both psychiatrist, nursing and other clinician shortages in some of our markets. And in some cases, that is muting or depressing our -- what would otherwise we think be higher demand and higher volumes. We had a number of initiatives in place to try and rectify those dynamics in those situations. And we believe, as we said at the end of the year, that our behavioral revenue growth should increase as the year goes on, as those comparisons become easier and as some of those initiatives begin to get more traction."

But in terms of overall revenue, it's a little bit harder to do. Obviously, however you slice it, the revenue growth in the acute care division for the quarter was extremely strong and well in excess of the 6% revenue growth that we anticipated in our guidance and in our budget for the year. Again, I think it's difficult to parse that growth out into individual pieces. We still continue to get some benefit from the ACA and expanded Medicaid enrollment and new commercial exchange enrollment, although, certainly, that benefit is diminishing. And now that we're into its third year, we continue to benefit, as our markets improve economically, and that certainly continues as well. But I think one of the most encouraging aspects of the quarter from our perspective is the single biggest admission growth for us was in our Medicare payer class. And in theory, Medicare patients are probably largely un-impacted by both the ACA dynamics and by an improving economy. And so I think what that's reflective of is just general strength of the franchises that we're operating in our local markets and the initiatives that our operators have put in place for some time now to create more and more physician integration in our markets to focus on really important service lines to us, like orthopedics and cardiology, and to really just focus on business development. I think that we have had for 4 or 5 quarters among the industry-leading admissions from an acute care perspective, and while I know the other companies have yet to report, my guess is we'll certainly be in that position again this quarter."

Generally, however, I would just sort of comment that many of the trends that we've remarked on in recent quarters have remained in place. You alluded to the fact that our Vegas market has been performing quite well, and that continued into Q1. Our Southern California market also performed very well. Our Temecula Hospital, which is now in its third year of operation, is performing particularly well, and that's driving some very strong numbers out of Riverside County, California. Washington, D.C. has been a strong market for us and wasn't in Q1. We see some weakness in the South Texas markets, which we remarked on previously, although even their volume numbers were certainly improved in Q1 as well."

And that is, we, I think like the others in the freestanding behavioral industry view the lifting of the IMD exclusion certainly as a positive development, albeit one that will show its impact or reflect its impact gradually over time. It will require some effort to get access to this patient population. And I think we've always said it's difficult to quantify what the potential benefit will be at the outset. But we, I think, share what is generally a consensus view that the benefit and the potential benefit is significant. I'll also make the point and I know we've talked about this a number of times previously that we view the lifting of the IMD exclusion and our ability to take these patients that have previously been seen in acute care hospitals with behavioral units in a broader context of trying to integrate with the behavioral units in acute care hospitals in our markets for all their patients. We have opened, over the course of the last few years, a number of leased units that we are -- leased behavioral units that we are leasing from some big not-for-profit acute care hospital systems around the country. We have a number of other similar conversations under way to accomplish the same thing. And while the lifting of the IMD exclusion might help accelerate and expedite those conversations, because now we can treat adult Medicaid patients as well, most of those conversations are even broader than that and include Medicare patients. They include commercial patients. And frankly, we view that overall as one of the most significant business development opportunities for our behavioral hospitals over the course of the next few years. So it's an important development, but I think one that fits into really kind of an overall strategy that we're extremely enthusiastic about."

So if we can reach agreement with acute care hospitals in our markets to get access to those patients, whether we lease the beds or manage the units or joint venture the units, or they close their units. The presumption, I think, on our part and what has played out at least in our initial conversation is we will have access not only to the patients, but also to the clinicians who are treating those patients.

If you go back and look, you will see that our occupancy percentage in the behavioral business in that sort of high 70, 76%, 77% range, has really been very consistent, I would say, for the last 7 or 8 years. And what that means is that during that period, we've been adding beds fairly aggressively, and obviously, the implication is we are filling those beds as quickly as we're adding them and maintaining our occupancy percentage. The reason we're adding beds with a 76% occupancy level is because in markets and in situations, we're clearly turning away patients because of volume constraints. And the economics of it are such that after you turn away more than just a handful of patients, it almost always make sense to add beds, and so we continue to do that. Now I will say that in my remarks where I talked about, for instance, the de novo development projects, those projects were undertaken really without regard to the IMD exclusion. Obviously, these been under development for some time. And so those projects are all in our minds justified by the demand in those markets, regardless of whether or not there is sort of incremental demand associated with the IMD. So as I said, I mean, in some ways, I think those are sort of discrete kind of activities. I think we think that the overall demand for behavioral has been strong, continues to be strong. We're going to add that to meet that. And at the same time, we're going to continue these conversations with acute care hospitals in our markets to get access to their behavioral patients and all their behavioral patients, not just their adult Medicaid patients, but their commercial and their Medicare and any other patients as well."

Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida had disproportionately higher unemployment rates in those markets than national averages, et cetera. So as those markets have recovered, I think we have benefited economically, disproportionately, perhaps, than some of our peers. But I think at the same time, and I think the strong start to 2016 really belies this idea, that as the ACA benefit has really sort of largely anniversary-ed itself, as the economic improvement has largely anniversary-ed itself, I think what you're seeing in the beginning of 2016 is the strengthening of our franchises is in those now very healthy markets, et cetera. We've been working a lot over the last few years to shore up our physician relationships and our physician integration arrangements, acquiring practices and integrating in other ways, focusing on certain service lines, and I think that's all really starting to pay dividends. And again, I'll highlight what I did earlier in an earlier response, which is when that growth is in Medicare, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we're probably gaining market share. Since that, that's not a patient population that is inherently growing or seeing more demand, et cetera. So we have not historically sort of really tried to parse out market by market, market share data, but I think we generally feel that in most of these markets that are performing well, not only are the markets doing well, but that we're gaining market share in those markets as well."

I think that inpatient surgeries were up something like 4% in the quarter. Outpatient surgeries were up like 7%, which is, again, some of the strongest surgical growth we've seen. Our Medicare case mix index was among the highest we've ever seen. I think that's reflective, obviously, of the surgical volume and continued a trend that we saw in Q4. So obviously, I think beyond the volume strength, which we've already commented on, we're seeing a lot of sort of high-quality revenue and high acuity revenue strength as well. On the behavioral side, I will say, I mean, the one sort of issue between the acute and the residential business is the residential business is not subject, I think, nearly as much to this whole psychiatry shortage issue. So the residential admissions have probably held in a little bit stronger than the acute admissions. And frankly, I think at least from a cosmetic perspective, that tends to hurt us because, at least, at the public companies, we tend to have a behavioral revenue sort of profile that is weighted more to the acute rather than to the residential business."

We think, generally, and this is certainly not true of every single acute care hospital, but we think, generally, acute care hospitals are not very good providers. They're not efficient providers of behavioral services. They have so many other things that they're doing that it's just not a top priority of theirs, and we generally feel we can do it better. We can do it higher quality. We can do it with better efficiency, and we're trying to make that argument to our acute care colleagues, if you will, in our markets around the country. And I think, in our minds, that's sort of the first step in getting access to these adult Medicaid patients. The second is more, I think, along the lines of what you're suggesting which is as a freestanding industry, and certainly, UHS, I think, has a reputation of being able to provide these services more efficiently, and at both high quality and lower cost, then we're certainly prepared to make those arguments into our managed care payers, who, quite frankly, I think, are as aware of that dynamic as we are with the rest of their patient population. So that to us, I think, is more of a secondary argument. We'd like to get the acute hospitals sort of to partner with us first, and then we'll kind of make our pitch to the MCOs."

During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.89 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications in our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $191.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased 7.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care division decreased to 17.7% during the second quarter of 2016 from 19.1% during the second quarter of 2015. 
On a same facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 2.0% during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 0.3% and adjusted patient days increased 0.2%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day rose 2.4% and 1.9% respectively during the second quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter.
On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division were 28.1% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
For the  6 months ended June 30, 2016, our cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately 50% to $801 million over the $532 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015. 
At June 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization increased to 45.5% as compared to 42.6% at June 30, 2015. 
We spent $120 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 and $248 million during the first 6 months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Also included were the construction costs related to a new four-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was recently completed and open. 
In addition, early in the second quarter we opened Skywood Recovery, a new 100-bed substance abuse treatment center located in August, Michigan. Skywood is part of our expanding foundations recovery network and provides integrated treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders.
Last month, we completed the refinancing of certain components of our debt, including: One, the issuance of $400 million of our 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022, which were issued at a yield of 4.35%; two, the issuance of $400 million or 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026; and three, a $200 million increase in borrowings pursuant to the term loan A facility of our credit agreement. These financings generated aggregate debt proceeds of approximately $1 billion of which $400 million was utilized to repay the 7 and a quarter -- 7 [ph] and 8 [ph] percent senior secured notes that matured in June 30, '16. $445 million was spent in connection with our previously disclosed may 2016 purchase of third-party minority ownership interest in our 6 acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada and the remainder was utilized to repay other floating rate debt. 
In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 235,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $59 [ph] million or approximately $123 million per share. Since inception, the program -- since inception of the program through June 30, '16, we purchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $406 million or approximately $117 per share. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think as you suggest, we really, I think, been talking about the pressures on our behavioral volumes for almost a year now. I think beginning in third quarter of last year, we began to clearly see the shortage of clinicians, psychiatrists and nurses and to a lesser degree, other mental health technicians as hampering our ability in certain facilities in a relatively small number of markets and a small number of facilities, hampering our ability in some cases to admit all the patients who were being presented to us for admission. I think those dynamics when we said this when we gave our guidance for 2016, we thought that those dynamics would persist through the second quarter of this year. We also suggested that they would improve in the back half of this year, in large part because: Number one, the comparisons would become easier as they will; and also because the number of initiatives that we've been working on and putting in place to mitigate this problem would also begin to gain some traction. So I think that the softer volumes in Q2 were somewhat disappointing to us as well, but largely expected. And I think our sense continues to be that they will improve in the back half of this year."

On the pricing side, I think we're absolutely where we expected to be. And so we're basically showing flattish volumes as compared to about 3% or 4% increase that we were anticipating. And I think we believe that, that entire GAAP and that entire difference can be attributed to the shortage of clinicians, in that if we're able to solve and resolve that problem, we should be able to get back to that sort of 5% overall revenue growth level and that 3% to 4% volume growth level that we anticipated originally."

Obviously, in a tight labor market, wage rates matter. And so in markets in which we are experiencing shortages, we conducted extensive compensation surveys and have modified our wage rates to make sure that we're competitive in the marketplace and every marketplace is different. We have also hired more people and dedicated more people to both the physician and nursing recruiting processes. And finally, I think we're very focused on the retention aspect and not just the recruiting aspect because for 2 reasons. I mean obviously because of the degree that we're able to retain our nurses, we don't have to by definition recruit for their replacements; and two, the degree that we recruit replacements, we want to make sure that they stay with us as long as they possibly can. And so our Chief Nursing Officer in the behavioral division has focus a lot of her attention on a new and sort of reinvigorated onboarding process, in which we're making sure that nurses are properly trained and have a clear career path and have the appropriate sort of mentoring resources dedicated to them, et cetera. So as I said, in every market, the approach is somewhat different. It's tailored to the market. But it is by far sort of the #1 focus of the operators in the behavioral division at this point."

We're still posting strong acute care volume numbers, obviously because we're the first to report this quarter. I don't know how we compare with others but my sense is these are still going to be fairly robust volumes. And I think what we said all along is I think we largely feel it's a function of the, just strong local franchises that we have in markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida.

Look, I think as a result of the improving U.S. economy and improving economy in our local market, we have seen a tightening of available labor force in all -- in all or most of our markets. That tightening, I think, is manifested somewhat differently in the 2 divisions that we have. We just talked about on the behavioral side. Quite frankly, we're just not able in some markets to find sufficient nurses and physicians, and as a consequence we are forced to turn patients away. On the acute side, I think it's manifested more prevalently in higher use of what we describe as premium pay, which would be over time or shift differential payments that we make to our current employees or the use of temporary or agency nurses, where current employees are not available. And certainly that use of premium pay on the acute side has contributed to the margin pressure in Q2 as it did back in Q3 of last year. But I think we continue to sort of focus on that, and it got better in Q4 and Q1 of this year. And I think our senses it we'll continue to focus on it and it is a solvable problem on the acute side. One other comment to  make on the acute side, vis-à-vis margins, is while I think the volumes on the acute side were well within our expectations, revenue per admission, growth of 1.3%, probably 50, 75 basis points short of where we thought we'd be. I think that's a bit of a weaker patient mix, and that's mostly maybe a growth in uncompensated patients in the quarter, not by a material amount. But I think mostly the big change from Q1 is in Q1 our other noncompensated volumes which were just so strong, particularly our Medicare volumes were so strong that they offset a bit of the uncompensated pickup in volumes in Q2 as Medicare and other commercial volumes moderated some of the uncompensated rise had a bit more of an effect. I think the staffing pressure or the premium pay pressure along with slight payer mix, the duration, probably explain the bulk of the pressure on acute care margins."

So our original guidance for the year was something like 6% acute care revenue from same-store revenue growth and we broke that into components, pretty evenly broke that into pricing and volume. So the 4% volume, same-store adjusted admission volume growth we saw in Q2 was well within and frankly ahead of our expectations while the pricing was slightly lower. But overall, acure care revenues were pretty close to what we expected. In terms of regional differences, I think most of the -- we clearly saw an overall moderation in acute care revenues in Q2 from the really extraordinary levels of Q1. We absolutely has said all along, that's what we expect would happen. And obviously, the Q2 performance is much closer to our original guidance. I think the regional commentary that we've given for probably a year now still holds in Q2 of this year, which is markets like Vegas and California and Florida have been sort of over performers.

Any commentary or any reaction we have at this point will be purely anecdotal. I think honestly, we've always have a view that probably the biggest impact doesn't start to occur even until the beginning of next year when managed-care plans have all their new plans in place and start to direct and redirect business in different ways. But I think finally, the other comment we've made on previous calls and I think we're still very much believers in is, we believe that the IMD or we view the IMD, the listing on the IMD exclusion in the broader context of our very pervasive and very aggressive program to try and collaborate with acute care hospitals around the country and to help gain access to their behavioral units.

I mean, one is in terms of the growth prospects of this business, the behavioral business that is, we remain fairly bullish, and that is because as I indicated in my earlier remarks, we believe that there's demonstrated demand for this business. And quite frankly, I think there are a number of dynamics that would suggest that, that demand does nothing but increase. We can have a whole long conversation about that. But things like the incidence of addiction illness and the need for addiction treatment and the opioid epidemic in the U.S., and the continued incidence of mental health issues in the elderly population, and then just a whole host of reasons to believe that, I think, the demand for mental health services is going to increase. And in fact, we believe we demonstrate that in our hospitals. We've been unable to demonstrate it in our financial results because of this clinician shortage. I think we have the view that in the short run, we will make inroads and significant inroads in that clinician shortage in the short run. And in the long-run, the market itself will correct for this as it has when the acute business has suffered through in nursing shortage some 10 years ago. And just nurse salaries went up and more people enrolled in nursing schools and the supply and demand balance sort of was restored. And I think the same thing will happen here, both with psychiatrists and nurses on the behavioral side. In terms of commenting on valuation of the 2 businesses, I think it's difficult for us to do. We clearly look at individual acquisition opportunities on a standalone discreet basis. And the growth potential in an individual behavioral facility or individual behavioral company versus an acute is really dependent on the markets they're in, what their specific market position is, what the strategies are for growth, et cetera. So we certainly don't go into any acquisition, either acute or behavioral with a notion of kind of there's a sort of evaluation to make sense. I do think UHS has a reputation for being fairly judicious in its acquisitions and its deployment of capital. I don't see that judicious changing but it's a market-by-market issue."

I think when that happens, when there's a growing demand for a particular service, the payers start to focus on it more. I think one way that we're seeing that manifest is I think the payers are more focused on this whole out-of-network segment of the addiction treatment business. I think a bunch of companies have grown up around that model. We were very targeted or we made a very targeted decision when we bought foundations that they were a company that had both out-of-network and in-network business put pretty evenly. And that they, in our minds, and I think we've seen them in the short time we've owned them, navigate very freely between sort of the two sides.

The real, the rationale for acquiring that business, which we have talked about on previous calls, more so at the time when we made the acquisition, is really to prepare for this risk shifting with several of the last questions we focused on. But it's more of the risk shift to the provider, we will have to shift our focus to more sort of an underwriting exercise.

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.89 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $191.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased 7.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care division decreased to 17.7% during the second quarter of 2016 from 19.1% during the second quarter of 2015. 
On a same-facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 2.0% during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 0.3% and adjusted patient days increased 0.2%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day rose 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter.
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division were 28.1% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, our cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately 50% to $801 million over the $532 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization increased to 45.5% as compared to 42.6% at June 30, 2015. 
We spent $120 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 and $248 million during the first 6 months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Also included were the construction costs related to a new 4-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was recently completed and opened. 
In addition, early in the second quarter, we opened Skywood Recovery, a new 100-bed substance abuse treatment center located in Augusta, Michigan. Skywood is part of our expanding Foundations Recovery Network and provides integrated treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders.
Last month, we completed the refinancing of certain components of our debt, including: one, the issuance of an additional $400 million of our 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022, which were issued at a yield of 4.35%; two, the issuance of $400 million or 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026; and three, a $200 million increase in borrowings pursuant to the term loan A facility of our credit agreement. These financings generated aggregate debt proceeds of approximately $1 billion of which $400 million was utilized to repay the 7.25 -- 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June 30, '16. $445 million was spent in connection with our previously disclosed May 2016 purchase of third-party minority ownership interest in our 6 acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the remainder was utilized to repay other floating rate debt. 
In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 235,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $59 million or approximately $123 million per share. Since inception, the program -- since inception of the program through June 30, '16, we purchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $406 million or approximately $117 per share. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think as you suggest, we really, I think, been talking about the pressures on our behavioral volumes for almost a year now. I think beginning in the third quarter of last year, we began to clearly see the shortage of clinicians, psychiatrists and nurses and to a lesser degree, other mental health technicians as hampering our ability -- in certain facilities in a relatively small number of markets and a small number of facilities, hampering our ability in some cases to admit all the patients who were being presented to us for admission. I think those dynamics, when we said this, when we gave our guidance for 2016, we thought that those dynamics would persist through the second quarter of this year. We also suggested that they would improve in the back half of this year, in large part because: number one, the comparisons would become easier as they will; and also because a number of the initiatives that we've been working on and putting in place to mitigate this problem would also begin to gain some traction. So I think that the softer volumes in Q2 were somewhat disappointing to us as well, but largely expected. And I think our sense continues to be that they will improve in the back half of this year."

On the pricing side, I think we're absolutely where we expected to be. And so we're basically showing flattish volumes as compared to that 3% or 4% increase that we were anticipating. And I think we believe that, that entire GAAP and that entire difference can be attributed to the shortage of clinicians, and that if we're able to solve and resolve that problem, we should be able to get back to that sort of 5% overall revenue growth level and that 3% to 4% volume growth level that we anticipated originally."

Obviously, in a tight labor market, wage rates matter. And so in markets in which we are experiencing shortages, we've conducted extensive compensation surveys and have modified our wage rates to make sure that we're competitive with the marketplace, and every marketplace is different. We have also hired more people and dedicated more people to both the physician and nursing recruiting processes. And finally, I think we're very focused on the retention aspect and not just the recruiting aspect because -- for 2 reasons: I mean, obviously, to the degree that we're able to retain our nurses, we don't have to, by definition, recruit for their replacements; and two, the degree that we recruit replacements, we want to make sure that they stay with us as long as they possibly can. And so our Chief Nursing Officer in the behavioral division has focused a lot of her attention on a new and sort of reinvigorated onboarding process, in which we're making sure that nurses are properly trained and have a clear career path and have the appropriate sort of mentoring resources dedicated to them, et cetera. So as I said, in every market, the approach is somewhat different. It's tailored to the market. But it is by far the sort of the #1 focus of the operators in the behavioral division at this point."

Obviously, a couple of years ago, the real focus was on parsing out the ACA impact versus the economy. And I think, clearly, the ACA impact has shown diminishing returns for the last few years. We're still posting strong acute care volume numbers, obviously, because we're the first to report this quarter. I don't know how we'll compare with others, but my sense is these are still going to be fairly robust volumes. And I think what we've said all along is I think that we largely feel it's a function of the -- just strong local franchises that we have in markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida, and the economic improvement in those markets but also our market position and our ability to take market share in those markets. I think it's very difficult to sort of parse the 4% improvement in same-store adjusted admissions among those various factors.

So I think, and we talked about this, certainly, last quarter and I think for several quarters, really, again, beginning in the second half of last year. Look, I think that as a result of the improving U.S. economy and the improving economy in our local markets, we have seen a tightening of the available labor force in all -- in most -- in all or most of our markets. That tightening, I think, is manifested somewhat differently in the 2 divisions that we have. We just talked about on the behavioral side, quite frankly, we're just not able, in some markets, to find sufficient nurses and physicians, and as a consequence, we're forced to turn patients away. On the acute side, I think it's manifested more prevalently in higher use of what we describe as premium pay, which would be over time or shift differential payments that we make to our current employees or the use of temporary or agency nurses, where current employees are not available. And certainly, that use of premium pay on the acute side has contributed to the margin pressure in Q2 as it did back in Q3 of last year. But I think we continue to sort of focus on that, and it got better in Q4 and Q1 of this year. And I think our sense is that we'll continue to focus on it, and it is a solvable problem on the acute side. The one other comment I'll make on the acute side vis-à-vis margins is while I think the volumes on the acute side were well within our expectations, the revenue per admission growth of 1.3%, probably 50, 75 basis points short of where we thought we'd be. I think that's a bit of a weaker patient mix, and that's mostly maybe a growth in uncompensated patients in the quarter, not by a material amount. But I think, mostly, the big change from Q1 is, in Q1, our other non-uncompensated volumes were just so strong, particularly our Medicare volumes were so strong that they offset a bit of the uncompensated tick-up in volumes. In Q2, as Medicare and other commercial volumes moderated some, the uncompensated rise had a bit more of an effect. So I think the staffing pressure or the premium pay pressure, along with a slight payer mix deterioration, probably explained the bulk of the pressure on acute care margins."

So the 4% volume -- same-store adjusted admission volume growth we saw in Q2 was, as I said, well within and frankly ahead of our expectations while the pricing was slightly lower. But overall, acute care revenues were pretty close to what we expected. In terms of regional differences, I think most of the -- we clearly saw an overall moderation in acute care revenues in Q2 from the really extraordinary levels of Q1. We absolutely have said all along, that's what we expect would happen. And obviously, the Q2 performance is much closer to our original guidance. I think the regional commentary that we've given for probably a year now still holds in Q2 of this year, which is that markets like Vegas and California and Florida have been sort of overperformers; and the Texas markets, namely the South Texas markets and Amarillo, probably had been the weaker performers."

We take that total number and compare it to our gross revenue, which I know is generally not a metric most people use very much. But I think from our perspective, it takes into account the pricing, the gross pricing impact that runs through those numbers. And while our second quarter uncompensated care experience was measurably higher than last year's second quarter, it's still lower than it was in the back half of last year. And so I think our general notion is that we're seeing a kind of slight uptick in uncompensated care. But it is -- it's reasonably steady over the last 3 or 4 quarters."

I think your first comment is absolutely right. I mean, we're sort of 2 or 3 weeks into the effective date of the new IMD-managed Medicaid rule. And I think any commentary or any reaction we'd have at this point would be purely anecdotal. I think, honestly, we've always had a view that, probably, the biggest impact doesn't start to occur even until the beginning of next year when managed care plans have all their new plans in place and start to direct and redirect business in different ways. But I think, finally, the other comment that we've made on previous calls, and I think we're still very much believers in, is that I think we believe that the IMD or we view the IMD, the listing of the IMD exclusion in the broader context of our very pervasive and very aggressive program to try and collaborate with acute care hospitals around the country and to help gain access to their behavioral units.

I mean, one is in terms of the growth prospects of this business, the behavioral business that is, we remain fairly bullish. And that is because, as I indicated in earlier remarks, we believe that there's demonstrated demand for this business. And quite frankly, I think there are a number of dynamics that would suggest that, that demand does nothing but increase. We can have a whole long conversation about that. But things like the incidence of addiction illness and the need for addiction treatment and the opioid epidemic in the U.S. and the continued incidence of mental health issues in the elderly population. And then just a whole host of reasons to believe that, I think, the demand for mental health services is going to increase. And in fact, we believe we demonstrate that in our hospitals. We've been unable to demonstrate it in our financial results because of this clinician shortage. I think we have the view that in the short run, we will make inroads and significant inroads in that clinician shortage in the short run. And in the long run, the market itself will correct for this as it has when the acute business has suffered through a nursing shortage 10 -- some 10 years ago. And just nurse salaries went up and more people enrolled in nursing schools, and the supply and demand balance sort of was restored. And I think the same thing will happen here, both with psychiatrists and with nurses on the behavioral side. In terms of commenting on valuations of the 2 businesses, I think it's difficult for us to do. We clearly look at individual acquisition opportunities on a standalone discreet basis. And the growth potential in an individual behavioral facility or individual behavioral company versus an acute is really dependent on the markets they're in, what their specific market position is, what the strategies are for growth, et cetera. So we certainly don't go into any acquisition, either acute or behavioral with a notion of kind of there's a fix sort of valuation that make sense. I do think UHS has a reputation for being fairly judicious in its acquisitions and its deployment of capital. I don't see that judiciousness changing, but I think it's a market-by-market issue."

I think when that happens, when there's a growing demand for a particular service, the payers start to focus on it more. I think one way that we're seeing that manifested is I think the payers are more focused on this whole out-of-network segment of the addiction treatment business. I think a bunch of companies have grown up around that model. We were very targeted or we made a very targeted decision when we bought Foundations that they were a company that had both out-of-network and in-network business put pretty evenly. And that they, in our minds, and I think we've seen them in the short time we've owned them, navigate very freely between sort of the 2 segments.

Obviously, Medicare announced, just within the last couple of days, an expansion of their bundled payment program. But the number of the details, I think, are still somewhat fuzzy.

And today, that number has probably dropped to 45%. That's been a gradual change. We've accounted for it. It has contributed to some degree to the rise in uncompensated care.

During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.89 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $191.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased 7.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care division decreased to 17.7% during the second quarter of 2016 from 19.1% during the second quarter of 2015. 
On a same-facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 2.0% during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 0.3% and adjusted patient days increased 0.2%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day rose 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter.
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division were 28.1% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, our cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately 50% to $801 million over the $532 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization increased to 45.5% as compared to 42.6% at June 30, 2015. 
We spent $120 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 and $248 million during the first 6 months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Also included were the construction costs related to a new 4-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was recently completed and opened. 
In addition, early in the second quarter, we opened Skywood Recovery, a new 100-bed substance abuse treatment center located in Augusta, Michigan. Skywood is part of our expanding Foundations Recovery Network and provides integrated treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders.
Last month, we completed the refinancing of certain components of our debt, including: one, the issuance of an additional $400 million of our 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022, which were issued at a yield of 4.35%; two, the issuance of $400 million or 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026; and three, a $200 million increase in borrowings pursuant to the term loan A facility of our credit agreement. These financings generated aggregate debt proceeds of approximately $1 billion of which $400 million was utilized to repay the 7.25 -- 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June 30, '16. $445 million was spent in connection with our previously disclosed May 2016 purchase of third-party minority ownership interest in our 6 acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the remainder was utilized to repay other floating rate debt. 
In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 235,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $59 million or approximately $123 million per share. Since inception, the program -- since inception of the program through June 30, '16, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $406 million or approximately $117 per share.

So I think as you suggest, we really, I think, been talking about the pressures on our behavioral volumes for almost a year now. I think beginning in the third quarter of last year, we began to clearly see the shortage of clinicians, psychiatrists and nurses and to a lesser degree, other mental health technicians as hampering our ability -- in certain facilities in a relatively small number of markets and a small number of facilities, hampering our ability in some cases to admit all the patients who were being presented to us for admission. I think those dynamics, when we said this, when we gave our guidance for 2016, we thought that those dynamics would persist through the second quarter of this year. We also suggested that they would improve in the back half of this year, in large part because: number one, the comparisons would become easier as they will; and also because a number of the initiatives that we've been working on and putting in place to mitigate this problem would also begin to gain some traction. So I think that the softer volumes in Q2 were somewhat disappointing to us as well, but largely expected. And I think our sense continues to be that they will improve in the back half of this year."

And I think we believe that, that entire GAAP and that entire difference can be attributed to the shortage of clinicians, and that if we're able to solve and resolve that problem, we should be able to get back to that sort of 5% overall revenue growth level and that 3% to 4% volume growth level that we anticipated originally."

Obviously, in a tight labor market, wage rates matter. And so in markets in which we are experiencing shortages, we've conducted extensive compensation surveys and have modified our wage rates to make sure that we're competitive with the marketplace, and every marketplace is different. We have also hired more people and dedicated more people to both the physician and nursing recruiting processes. And finally, I think we're very focused on the retention aspect and not just the recruiting aspect because -- for 2 reasons: I mean, obviously, to the degree that we're able to retain our nurses, we don't have to, by definition, recruit for their replacements; and two, the degree that we recruit replacements, we want to make sure that they stay with us as long as they possibly can. And so our Chief Nursing Officer in the behavioral division has focused a lot of her attention on a new and sort of reinvigorated on-boarding process, in which we're making sure that nurses are properly trained and have a clear career path and have the appropriate sort of mentoring resources dedicated to them, et cetera. So as I said, in every market, the approach is somewhat different. It's tailored to the market. But it is by far the sort of the #1 focus of the operators in the behavioral division at this point."

We're still posting strong acute care volume numbers, obviously, because we're the first to report this quarter. I don't know how we'll compare with others, but my sense is these are still going to be fairly robust volumes. And I think what we've said all along is I think that we largely feel it's a function of the -- just strong local franchises that we have in markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida, and the economic improvement in those markets but also our market position and our ability to take market share in those markets. I think it's very difficult to sort of parse the 4% improvement in same-store adjusted admissions among those various factors.

So I think, and we talked about this, certainly, last quarter and I think for several quarters, really, again, beginning in the second half of last year. Look, I think that as a result of the improving U.S. economy and the improving economy in our local markets, we have seen a tightening of the available labor force in all -- in most -- in all or most of our markets. That tightening, I think, is manifested somewhat differently in the 2 divisions that we have. We just talked about on the behavioral side, quite frankly, we're just not able, in some markets, to find sufficient nurses and physicians, and as a consequence, we're forced to turn patients away. On the acute side, I think it's manifested more prevalently in higher use of what we describe as premium pay, which would be over time or shift differential payments that we make to our current employees or the use of temporary or agency nurses, where current employees are not available. And certainly, that use of premium pay on the acute side has contributed to the margin pressure in Q2 as it did back in Q3 of last year. But I think we continue to sort of focus on that, and it got better in Q4 and Q1 of this year. And I think our sense is that we'll continue to focus on it, and it is a solvable problem on the acute side. The one other comment I'll make on the acute side vis-à-vis margins is while I think the volumes on the acute side were well within our expectations, the revenue per admission growth of 1.3%, probably 50, 75 basis points short of where we thought we'd be. I think that's a bit of a weaker patient mix, and that's mostly maybe a growth in uncompensated patients in the quarter, not by a material amount. But I think, mostly, the big change from Q1 is, in Q1, our other non-uncompensated volumes were just so strong, particularly our Medicare volumes were so strong that they offset a bit of the uncompensated tick-up in volumes. In Q2, as Medicare and other commercial volumes moderated some, the uncompensated rise had a bit more of an effect. So I think the staffing pressure or the premium pay pressure, along with a slight payer mix deterioration, probably explained the bulk of the pressure on acute care margins."

But overall, acute care revenues were pretty close to what we expected. In terms of regional differences, I think most of the -- we clearly saw an overall moderation in acute care revenues in Q2 from the really extraordinary levels of Q1. We absolutely have said all along, that's what we expect would happen. And obviously, the Q2 performance is much closer to our original guidance. I think the regional commentary that we've given for probably a year now still holds in Q2 of this year, which is that markets like Vegas and California and Florida have been sort of overperformers; and the Texas markets, namely the South Texas markets and Amarillo, probably had been the weaker performers."

Honestly, I think they were up by a similar amount in Q1 as, I think, I said earlier. I think the difference was in Q1. Other volumes were just so strong that they tended to really offset any impact of that increase. I think the other sort of commentary I'd make about uncompensated care in general is we take our total uncompensated care, all of which we disclose in the press release, the bad debt, the charity care, the uninsured discount. We take that total number and compare it to our gross revenue, which I know is generally not a metric most people use very much. But I think from our perspective, it takes into account the pricing, the gross pricing impact that runs through those numbers. And while our second quarter uncompensated care experience was measurably higher than last year's second quarter, it's still lower than it was in the back half of last year. And so I think our general notion is that we're seeing a kind of slight uptick in uncompensated care. But it is -- it's reasonably steady over the last 3 or 4 quarters."

I think your first comment is absolutely right. I mean, we're sort of 2 or 3 weeks into the effective date of the new IMD-managed Medicaid rule. And I think any commentary or any reaction we'd have at this point would be purely anecdotal. I think, honestly, we've always had a view that, probably, the biggest impact doesn't start to occur even until the beginning of next year when managed care plans have all their new plans in place and start to direct and redirect business in different ways. But I think, finally, the other comment that we've made on previous calls, and I think we're still very much believers in, is that I think we believe that the IMD or we view the IMD, the listing of the IMD exclusion in the broader context of our very pervasive and very aggressive program to try and collaborate with acute care hospitals around the country and to help gain access to their behavioral units. And obviously, the lifting of the IMD exclusion removes one of the hurdles that I think has always prevented that from happening in a pervasive way.

I mean, one is in terms of the growth prospects of this business, the behavioral business that is, we remain fairly bullish. And that is because, as I indicated in earlier remarks, we believe that there's demonstrated demand for this business. And quite frankly, I think there are a number of dynamics that would suggest that, that demand does nothing but increase. We can have a whole long conversation about that. But things like the incidence of addiction illness and the need for addiction treatment and the opioid epidemic in the U.S. and the continued incidence of mental health issues in the elderly population. And then just a whole host of reasons to believe that, I think, the demand for mental health services is going to increase. And in fact, we believe we demonstrate that in our hospitals. We've been unable to demonstrate it in our financial results because of this clinician shortage. I think we have the view that in the short run, we will make inroads and significant inroads in that clinician shortage in the short run. And in the long run, the market itself will correct for this as it has when the acute business has suffered through a nursing shortage 10 -- some 10 years ago. And just nurse salaries went up and more people enrolled in nursing schools, and the supply and demand balance sort of was restored. And I think the same thing will happen here, both with psychiatrists and with nurses on the behavioral side. In terms of commenting on valuations of the 2 businesses, I think it's difficult for us to do. We clearly look at individual acquisition opportunities on a standalone discreet basis. And the growth potential in an individual behavioral facility or individual behavioral company versus an acute is really dependent on the markets they're in, what their specific market position is, what the strategies are for growth, et cetera. So we certainly don't go into any acquisition, either acute or behavioral with a notion of kind of there's a fix sort of valuation that make sense. I do think UHS has a reputation for being fairly judicious in its acquisitions and its deployment of capital. I don't see that judiciousness changing, but I think it's a market-by-market issue."

I think when that happens, when there's a growing demand for a particular service, the payers start to focus on it more. I think one way that we're seeing that manifested is I think the payers are more focused on this whole out-of-network segment of the addiction treatment business. I think a bunch of companies have grown up around that model. We were very targeted or we made a very targeted decision when we bought Foundations that they were a company that had both out-of-network and in-network business put pretty evenly. And that they, in our minds, and I think we've seen them in the short time we've owned them, navigate very freely between sort of the 2 segments.

We were volunteers in some of the early Medicare demonstration programs. We can remain in some of those. We've exited some. I think it's a developing and a continually evolving area. But I think we have worked now for probably the last 2 or 3 years to make sure that we're prepared for it. And so I think we remain prepared. Obviously, Medicare announced, just within the last couple of days, an expansion of their bundled payment program. But the number of the details, I think, are still somewhat fuzzy. So it's difficult to, again, make any precise predictions. As far as managed care contracting, I think we're probably still 45, 60 days away from the real sort of the height of the 2017 renegotiation process. But I would suggest that we're not seeing huge changes, either in our rates or in the structure of those contracts from what we've been experiencing over the last few years."

And today, that number has probably dropped to 45%. That's been a gradual change. We've accounted for it. It has contributed to some degree to the rise in uncompensated care.

During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.89 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $191.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased 7.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care division decreased to 17.7% during the second quarter of 2016 from 19.1% during the second quarter of 2015. 
On a same-facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 2.0% during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 0.3% and adjusted patient days increased 0.2%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day rose 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior year quarter.
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division were 28.1% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, our cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately 50% to $801 million over the $532 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization increased to 45.5% as compared to 42.6% at June 30, 2015. 
We spent $120 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 and $248 million during the first 6 months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Also included were the construction costs related to a new 4-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was recently completed and opened. 
In addition, early in the second quarter, we opened Skywood Recovery, a new 100-bed substance abuse treatment center located in Augusta, Michigan. Skywood is part of our expanding Foundations Recovery Network and provides integrated treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders.
Last month, we completed the refinancing of certain components of our debt, including: one, the issuance of an additional $400 million of our 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022, which were issued at a yield of 4.35%; two, the issuance of $400 million or 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026; and three, a $200 million increase in borrowings pursuant to the term loan A facility of our credit agreement. These financings generated aggregate debt proceeds of approximately $1 billion of which $400 million was utilized to repay the 7.25 -- 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June 30, '16. $445 million was spent in connection with our previously disclosed May 2016 purchase of third-party minority ownership interest in our 6 acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the remainder was utilized to repay other floating rate debt. 
In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 235,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $59 million or approximately $123 million per share. Since inception, the program -- since inception of the program through June 30, '16, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $406 million or approximately $117 per share. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think as you suggest, we really, I think, been talking about the pressures on our behavioral volumes for almost a year now. I think beginning in the third quarter of last year, we began to clearly see the shortage of clinicians, psychiatrists and nurses and to a lesser degree, other mental health technicians as hampering our ability -- in certain facilities in a relatively small number of markets and a small number of facilities, hampering our ability in some cases to admit all the patients who were being presented to us for admission. I think those dynamics, when we said this, when we gave our guidance for 2016, we thought that those dynamics would persist through the second quarter of this year. We also suggested that they would improve in the back half of this year, in large part because: number one, the comparisons would become easier as they will; and also because a number of the initiatives that we've been working on and putting in place to mitigate this problem would also begin to gain some traction. So I think that the softer volumes in Q2 were somewhat disappointing to us as well, but largely expected. And I think our sense continues to be that they will improve in the back half of this year."

And I think we believe that, that entire GAAP and that entire difference can be attributed to the shortage of clinicians, and that if we're able to solve and resolve that problem, we should be able to get back to that sort of 5% overall revenue growth level and that 3% to 4% volume growth level that we anticipated originally."

Obviously, in a tight labor market, wage rates matter. And so in markets in which we are experiencing shortages, we've conducted extensive compensation surveys and have modified our wage rates to make sure that we're competitive with the marketplace, and every marketplace is different. We have also hired more people and dedicated more people to both the physician and nursing recruiting processes. And finally, I think we're very focused on the retention aspect and not just the recruiting aspect because -- for 2 reasons: I mean, obviously, to the degree that we're able to retain our nurses, we don't have to, by definition, recruit for their replacements; and two, the degree that we recruit replacements, we want to make sure that they stay with us as long as they possibly can. And so our Chief Nursing Officer in the behavioral division has focused a lot of her attention on a new and sort of reinvigorated on-boarding process, in which we're making sure that nurses are properly trained and have a clear career path and have the appropriate sort of mentoring resources dedicated to them, et cetera.

I mean, I think we have said, quite frankly, for the last few years that it's difficult to parse out acute care revenue improvement. Obviously, a couple of years ago, the real focus was on parsing out the ACA impact versus the economy. And I think, clearly, the ACA impact has shown diminishing returns for the last few years. We're still posting strong acute care volume numbers, obviously, because we're the first to report this quarter. I don't know how we'll compare with others, but my sense is these are still going to be fairly robust volumes. And I think what we've said all along is I think that we largely feel it's a function of the -- just strong local franchises that we have in markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida, and the economic improvement in those markets but also our market position and our ability to take market share in those markets. I think it's very difficult to sort of parse the 4% improvement in same-store adjusted admissions among those various factors. Suffice it to say that we still think that's a pretty good number and well within our expectations."

So I think, and we talked about this, certainly, last quarter and I think for several quarters, really, again, beginning in the second half of last year. Look, I think that as a result of the improving U.S. economy and the improving economy in our local markets, we have seen a tightening of the available labor force in all -- in most -- in all or most of our markets. That tightening, I think, is manifested somewhat differently in the 2 divisions that we have. We just talked about on the behavioral side, quite frankly, we're just not able, in some markets, to find sufficient nurses and physicians, and as a consequence, we're forced to turn patients away. On the acute side, I think it's manifested more prevalently in higher use of what we describe as premium pay, which would be over time or shift differential payments that we make to our current employees or the use of temporary or agency nurses, where current employees are not available. And certainly, that use of premium pay on the acute side has contributed to the margin pressure in Q2 as it did back in Q3 of last year. But I think we continue to sort of focus on that, and it got better in Q4 and Q1 of this year. And I think our sense is that we'll continue to focus on it, and it is a solvable problem on the acute side. The one other comment I'll make on the acute side vis-à-vis margins is while I think the volumes on the acute side were well within our expectations, the revenue per admission growth of 1.3%, probably 50, 75 basis points short of where we thought we'd be. I think that's a bit of a weaker patient mix, and that's mostly maybe a growth in uncompensated patients in the quarter, not by a material amount. But I think, mostly, the big change from Q1 is, in Q1, our other non-uncompensated volumes were just so strong, particularly our Medicare volumes were so strong that they offset a bit of the uncompensated tick-up in volumes. In Q2, as Medicare and other commercial volumes moderated some, the uncompensated rise had a bit more of an effect. So I think the staffing pressure or the premium pay pressure, along with a slight payer mix deterioration, probably explained the bulk of the pressure on acute care margins."

But overall, acute care revenues were pretty close to what we expected. In terms of regional differences, I think most of the -- we clearly saw an overall moderation in acute care revenues in Q2 from the really extraordinary levels of Q1. We absolutely have said all along, that's what we expect would happen. And obviously, the Q2 performance is much closer to our original guidance. I think the regional commentary that we've given for probably a year now still holds in Q2 of this year, which is that markets like Vegas and California and Florida have been sort of overperformers; and the Texas markets, namely the South Texas markets and Amarillo, probably had been the weaker performers."

And I think any commentary or any reaction we'd have at this point would be purely anecdotal.

I mean, one is in terms of the growth prospects of this business, the behavioral business that is, we remain fairly bullish. And that is because, as I indicated in earlier remarks, we believe that there's demonstrated demand for this business. And quite frankly, I think there are a number of dynamics that would suggest that, that demand does nothing but increase. We can have a whole long conversation about that. But things like the incidence of addiction illness and the need for addiction treatment and the opioid epidemic in the U.S. and the continued incidence of mental health issues in the elderly population. And then just a whole host of reasons to believe that, I think, the demand for mental health services is going to increase. And in fact, we believe we demonstrate that in our hospitals. We've been unable to demonstrate it in our financial results because of this clinician shortage. I think we have the view that in the short run, we will make inroads and significant inroads in that clinician shortage in the short run. And in the long run, the market itself will correct for this as it has when the acute business has suffered through a nursing shortage 10 -- some 10 years ago. And just nurse salaries went up and more people enrolled in nursing schools, and the supply and demand balance sort of was restored. And I think the same thing will happen here, both with psychiatrists and with nurses on the behavioral side. In terms of commenting on valuations of the 2 businesses, I think it's difficult for us to do. We clearly look at individual acquisition opportunities on a standalone discreet basis. And the growth potential in an individual behavioral facility or individual behavioral company versus an acute is really dependent on the markets they're in, what their specific market position is, what the strategies are for growth, et cetera. So we certainly don't go into any acquisition, either acute or behavioral with a notion of kind of there's a fix sort of valuation that make sense. I do think UHS has a reputation for being fairly judicious in its acquisitions and its deployment of capital. I don't see that judiciousness changing, but I think it's a market-by-market issue."

I think when that happens, when there's a growing demand for a particular service, the payers start to focus on it more. I think one way that we're seeing that manifested is I think the payers are more focused on this whole out-of-network segment of the addiction treatment business. I think a bunch of companies have grown up around that model. We were very targeted or we made a very targeted decision when we bought Foundations that they were a company that had both out-of-network and in-network business put pretty evenly. And that they, in our minds, and I think we've seen them in the short time we've owned them, navigate very freely between sort of the 2 segments. So if this business shifts to more of an in-network model, we think we'll be prepared to make that transition more easily than a number of these other companies that are focused almost exclusively on that out-of-network model."

And again, I think this is a trend, I think, that has now been underway for a while now. There's no question that over the last few years, the amount of the hospital bill that is due from the patient, because of co-pays and deductibles, has grown. And as a consequence, the amount we collect on that portion of the bill has declined. So 10 years ago, we collected 55% to 60% of the patient portion of the bill. And today, that number has probably dropped to 45%. That's been a gradual change. We've accounted for it. It has contributed to some degree to the rise in uncompensated care. But I think we've also always said that 2/3 of our overall uncompensated care numbers are the result of those who purely have no insurance. And I think that remains largely the case."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter 2016. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represents forecasts projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $157.2 million or $1.60 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015. 
  
On the same facility basis in our acute care division, net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 increased 9.0% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On the same facility basis, operating margins for our acute-care hospitals decreased to 14.7% during the third quarter of 2016 from 15.3% during the third quarter of 2015. 
On the same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.7% during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter 2015. During this year's third quarter, adjusted patient days our behavioral health facilities increased 1.1%, and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5% as compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 26.0% and 27.4% during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 38% to $1.1 billion over the $796 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2015. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45.3%. We spent $148 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2016 and $396 million during the first 9 months of 2016. 
Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the newly built Henderson Hospital, a 142-bed acute care facility located in Henderson, Nevada, which has been completed and is scheduled to open next week. We have also completed construction on a new 55-bed four-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was opened during the third quarter of this year. 
As previously announced in August of this year, we purchased Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed facility located in Perap [ph] Nevada. Together with our 5 existing acute-care facilities in the market, Anderson Hospital and Desert View Hospital further complement our ability to provide a wide array of comprehensive medical services to patients in the Las Vegas, Nevada area.
Within our Behavioral Health division, we have opened a total of 373 new beds at some of our busiest facilities during the first 9 months of 2016. In addition, we have been working on joint venture Behavioral Health integration projects with industry leaders throughout the country. We're excited about these partnerships that help address the growing demand for inpatient and outpatient mental health services. We are proud to be partnering with Lancaster General Health and Medicine to build and operate a 126-bed Behavioral Health Hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Groundbreaking of this facility is slated for the spring of 2017, and the hospital is projected to open during the summer of 2018. 
In addition, we have formed a joint venture with Providence Health Care to build a 100-bed freestanding Behavioral Health Hospital in Spokane, Washington. 
In connection to our $800 million stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 458,000 shares at an average cost of approximately $58 million during the third quarter this year. Since the inception of the program through September 30, 2016, we had repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $462 million, and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $338 million as of the end of the third quarter. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2016, we're now narrowing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.16 to $7.43 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This narrowed guidance which excludes the reported electronic -- the expected electronic health records impact for the year increases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 1%, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 2%. We'll be please to answer your questions at this time."

So I think from the beginning, Justin, and the beginning and I think in my mind it was just the third quarter of last year, so we've been talking about muted volumes in the behavioral business for about a year now, largely driven by staffing shortages, shortages of psychiatrists and nurses. I think it started out as more of a psychiatrist kind of centered problem, and it has evolved into a more of a nursing shortage problem. But I think what we have highlighted, and there's no perfect way to kind of parse this issue, but we identified 4, 5 or 6 markets that were most problematic in terms of having vacancies for these clinical positions and having to turn away patients, and as a consequence, have significantly and measurably muted volumes in those markets because we simply didn't have enough qualified clinical professionals to treat those patients. Over the course of the year, I think the market that largely remained the same. We think those markets probably encompass depending on how you count them, some 20-odd facilities, again during the 12 months, maybe a facility sort of entered the list or came off the list. But I think for the most part, the list remains the same. I think we've seen some improvement in those markets. Sort of by definition, I think our overall volumes are increasing a little bit. I think we see pockets of weakness in some of the other markets, but I think for the most part, we continue to believe that if we focus on the 4 or 5 most problematic markets as we have been, that we'll continue to make progress. I think and I alluded to this a little bit I think in your question, I think the third quarter was a little bit of a kind of a with soft for us in a sense that as we are hiring new nurses, as we're paying sign-on bonuses, as we're investing in sort of recruitment and retention of nurses, our labor costs are going up. We clearly saw that in Q3 and honestly, our volumes are going up a little bit, but they're not responding as quickly. A part of this is just a mechanical sort of a process as we hire nurses. They had to get noticed of their old jobs, if they're coming from another employer, then they join us and they go through an orientation or training, and so we're paying them and we're incurring costs but we're not necessarily able to increase volumes immediately. And I think what you saw in Q3 was a little bit of that sort of dynamic of increased cost without the complete benefit of the commensurate increase in volumes. We think that's a relatively temporary situation that should continue to improve pretty measurably over the next quarter or 2."

Can you talk about the pace of improvement and how you think it gets back -- when you think it gets back to that target 5% -- 4% to 5%, 6% same-store revenue growth range? And then given the level of spending, can you walk us through what you would think would be a reasonable equation, let's just say for 2017, in terms of if the same-store growth is 4%, 5%, what does that equate to in terms of EBITDA growth when you get there?"

I think for the most part, we've been hitting tho",336,"So our original guidance for 2016 for our behavioral business, same-store behavioral business was 5% revenue growth, which was sort of implied metrics for that was 3% to 4% volume growth and 1% 2% pricing. I think for the most part, we've been hitting those pricing targets, and so this really is a volume issue. And so when you parse those numbers, we are somewhere 200, 250 basis points short of volumes from where we thought we would be. We also thought that if we could get to that 5% volume growth, we would get to something like a 6% or 7% expansion of EBITDA, or growth in EBITDA. And I think that those, that assumption and that EBITDA growth already presumed because when we gave our guidance for the year, we were certainly well aware of the labor shortage already at that time. And so I think we presume that we will be raising salaries, we would be spending and investing more money in recruitment and retention, and so that EBITDA growth in comparison to the revenue growth was already sort of factoring in some amount of labor pressure. So really, I think the question you're asking, which is perfectly reasonable one is when do get this additional 200, 250 basis points in volume. I think we feel like we're doing most of the right things. I think we feel like we're making progress. I think we feel like at some point next year, in 2017, we will get there. Exactly how quickly we get there, exactly when that improvement comes and how quickly that improvement comes, it's difficult to say. Obviously, the next time we speak to this group will be in late February when we give our 2017 guidance. I think we'll up in a much better position to be more precise at that time, but I think we certainly feel that the metrics that we laid out for this year are well within reach and certainly achievable at some point during 2017."

I think on the acute side, I think the challenge has mostly been the use of what we describe as premium pay. And that is paying either our own nurses overtime or shift differentials or whatever to work additional or incremental shifts or paying temporary or registry nurses generally a fairly significant premium over what would be our normal rate of pay. And that's really what's driving up our average wage rates. I don't think our underlying sort of, I'll call them, normalized wage rates, I would say, on the acute division are going up much more than sort of 3%, 3.5%. Maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we might have thought a year ago but not a huge needle mover. Just I think as sort of to put it in context, I think in normal -- in sort of a normal environment, we would expect the use of temporary nurses to represent something in any given quarter around 2% of our overall labor force. I think in this quarter, that number was between 2 and 3x that. And even that doesn't seem -- it seems like it's relatively small numbers. Because you're paying those temporary nurses, in many cases, twice what you're paying a regular nurse, the impact starts to add up relatively quickly. Same thing I think is true on the behavioral side. The real issue -- and if you've looked at our segment data for the last 4 quarters or so, you don't see a lot of pressure on our wage line in behavioral. And that's because quite frankly, we've just been unable to find sufficient number of nurses. It's really not been a question of willingness to pay them or to use temporary nurses or whatever. It's just been an absolute inability to find them at all, especially in these markets that I alluded to before. So I'm going to say the same thing, I mean, I think wage rates in the -- underlying wage rates in the behavioral division are maybe going up at this point, 2.5% or 3%. And maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we thought. But I don't think it's driving the numbers measurably, other than what I said before. I think already our EBITDA growth targets that we already had talked about for 2016 for both divisions, I think, already incorporated some amount of this labor pressure that we've been talking about."

Our adjusted admissions in the quarter were up about 4.5%. I think our government admissions were up in that neighborhood. Commercial admissions, while up, were up slightly less than that, maybe 1%, 1.5%. And then I think on insured admissions, we're up a little bit more than the average, probably in the 6%, 7% range. And again, these are all trends that, I think, we've talked about for, I would say, since the middle of last year. As the benefits of the ACA have started to anniversary, we're not continuing to get that benefit of increased Medicaid -- from increased Medicaid expansion. Continued commercial enrollment, as a matter of fact, I think we're seeing some level of disenrollment as premiums rise and other factors occur. So I think all that payer mix sort of trending has been ongoing for about a year now. We see some volatility between quarters. But if you look at the 4- or 5-month trend, I think you'll see that we've been hitting that sort of 3% revenue per admission growth rate pretty consistently over that period of time."

And a number of these arrangements have already been entered into and some of them are already in operation. I think that the first few of the arrangements that we entered into were just these sort of lease arrangements, where we would joint venture with large not-for-profit health care systems. I mentioned in my opening remarks a deal to build a new hospital with Providence in the Washington state market. But we already have 2 other arrangements, where we just occupied existing units, which we lease from Providence and run behavioral units there. And both of them are ongoing for some time and have been incorporated in our results for some time. Overall, it is a significant focus, probably from a business development perspective, the single biggest focus in the behavioral division. This is what we describe as acute care integration efforts. And so I think that they will continue and will continue to enter into new ones. Exactly how significant they'll be, I think, remains to be seen. And some of them will take some time to develop. I mentioned the Lancaster General joint venture in my remarks. But that hospital, new hospital, will not open until 2018. I think when we give our guidance for 2017, we will probably sort of frame it as here's our same-store expectations in terms of volume and revenue growth, and then we will probably separately spike out what the impact of these new ventures will be. And I think we'll probably do that frankly on a continuing basis after that."

I mean, when we identify those 4, 5, 6 markets and the 20-or-so hospitals, the way that we identify them or the criteria we use was that in those hospitals, we had actually closed a unit or closed a number of beds or we capped our census so that in an 80-bed hospital, we were capping or limiting our census to, let's say, 40 patients or whatever the amount of sort of qualified nurses we had would limit us to. Certainly, elsewhere in the portfolio, we were facing some pressures of turning away a patient on this day or not having enough nurses on a particular day. But these were hospitals where again we had closed a unit or we had capped our census for an extended period of time. And that's how we were categorizing them. I think at those hospitals -- and I don't have the occupancy data in front of me, Paula. But I will say that at those hospitals on average, I think their patient days or their volumes were down during this period, I would say, 10% to 15%. And again, I think that the bulk of the effort to get the division back to the 200, 250 basis point shortage in volumes that we're really facing from our original guidance is getting those hospitals back to kind of the 3% or 4% volume growth that we think most of the rest of the portfolio is posting. Obviously, if we can't get those hospitals back to that level and we can get the remaining 180 hospitals or whatever the exact number is to increase their volumes by 25 or 50 basis points, I mean, that will get us to the same place. But I think we just try to frame it that way because I think frankly it helped us as we tried to focus on addressing this problem and we thought it would help people understand that. As with many things, this was really kind of an 80-20 issue. And the bulk of our focus was on a relatively small number of markets and facilities that were facing the most dramatic shortages."

And I think we have said again for the last year that this is not a problem of diminishing demand in the sort of the underlying fundamentals of this business. As a matter of fact, I think if anything, we believe that again the underlying demand has done nothing but increase and continues to increase. And our view of both the intermediate- and long-term prospects from a demand perspective in this business remain extremely robust and we're very enthusiastic about it. And instead, we're focused on what we believe is a much more near-term issue of making sure that we have again enough qualified staff in all of our facilities to satisfy that demand. I think that obviously, and as you pointed out, I mean, the fact that we're adding beds -- and obviously, we're adding beds in markets where we do have enough qualified staff and we can accommodate those patients. And we're not necessarily adding beds in those markets where we don't have enough staff. Now at some point, we may add beds in those markets as we resolve the problem. But I mean, our continued investment in capacity in the business, I think, is a reflection of the fact that we expect it to grow at fairly robust rates. I mean, I'm not going to tell you we're not prepared to give 2017 guidance today. But I think when we give our guidance in 2017, it will reflect the fact that we believe: a, the business is going to continue to grow; and b, that we'll continue to find new ways to enter markets, particularly acute care hospital market, and help to penetrate their behavioral services, which will also help the business grow."

So the IMD, the lifting of the IMD exclusion for the managed Medicaid population could occur as early as July of '16 [ph], if the states approved that. And I think some of our states have done so. I think we always had the view that the immediate impact of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, particularly in sort of a midyear cycle, was going to be fairly minimal because networks were already established, a benefit plan design was already established. And to have effectively new hospitals join the network midyear and to really redirect a substantial number of patients was not a terribly practical matter in the middle of the year. So I think in that sense, we always had the view that beginning with a new plan year in January of '17, we would get more of a measurable impact. And the reality is some states will not approve the lifting until July of '17, so some of this may be delayed even until '18. I think, however, our view of this has also evolved to, and this really encompasses my previous remarks, to believe that really the greatest opportunity we have here to take advantage of that adult Medicaid population are these arrangements that we will reach collaboratively with acute care hospitals to joint venture with them, to lease beds from them, to help them manage units because that -- those opportunities will give us access, not only to their adult Medicaid patient population but also to their commercial population, to their Medicare population. And so in some respects, the opportunity that we're pursuing through that avenue is even greater than the IMD opportunity. Although in fairness, it will take some time to realize as we have to negotiate these arrangements and implement them and in some cases, build new capacity or in some cases, renovate existing capacity. So there's some time lags in all this. But ultimately, given the fact that half of all the behavioral beds in the U.S. reside in acute care hospitals, we think that this opportunity to penetrate those beds is a tremendous and, as I remarked before, probably the single biggest business development opportunity we have domestically over the next 5 years or so."

So look, I think the reality is I don't know that we have kind of a terribly sort of insightful view of how this is all going to play out. I will make just some preliminary comments that we have said from the very beginning of the Affordable Care Act that the bulk of the benefit that we've realized from the Affordable Care Act tended to be on the Medicaid expansion side of the ACA. I think on a percentage basis, we had more hospital beds in expansion states than any of our peers, mostly because of our significant oversized presence in Nevada. But obviously, we benefited in California, we benefited in the District of Columbia. The amount of benefit that we got from commercial exchange enrollment was always more limited. And so to the degree that there is some level of disenrollment, which I think there is and probably will continue to be, I think, will impact us but will not impact us in a terribly material and measurable way. And I think it's also worth noting that we've said from the outset that I think the ACA has had a relatively minor impact on the behavioral business. And so again, I think to the degree that there is disruption in the markets, that there is disenrollment, that there's a limiting number of payers remaining, I don't think that's going to have a measurable impact on us. I will say that in most of our markets, there still are multiple exchange providers in business. And a Blue Cross plan almost inevitably is one of them. But even though we've seen some players leave the market, I think in most of our markets, there remains some level of choice and competition. So I think that is helpful."

Our 2016 acute care guidance presumed 6% revenue growth and 7% or 8% EBITDA growth. And again, I think those projections and that EBITDA growth already presume that there would be some level of labor inflation because of pressure on wage rates and pressure on increased use of premium pay, et cetera. The acute results have been choppier and a little bit more volatile than the behavioral results, I think. And I've encouraged people not to look at a particular quarter as sort of reflective or emblematic of the trajectory but to look at the last 4 or 5 quarters combined. And I think if you look at the business that way, we have been pretty routinely hitting at least that 6% revenue growth target. And I think during that period, we do also have margin expansion. Again, I don't think we're going to have it every single quarter. I think there will be some quarters that will be tighter than others.

Everyone is different. I described a number of arrangements we have, where we simply lease beds from an acute care hospital and run a behavioral unit effectively in their building or on their campus. And in those cases, we take on all the economics, other than paying them a lease payment. In the deals that I've described in my remarks, we're building new facilities. And in each of those cases, I think the acute care partner will contribute their percentage of the capital investment. And the partnership percentages vary. Some of these are 50-50 deals. Some of them are 80-20 deals, where we're the 80% partner. Again, I think one of the things that were willing to do is to provide these acute care hospitals with a lot of optionality as to how we can proceed. And we'd love to have all the economics where -- but if we have an acute care partner who wants to retain a significant amount of economics, we can reach an agreement on that. I think we're happy to do that. So I think you're going to see these deals take a lot of different forms.

And look, this is not exclusive to the behavioral business but certainly, in the behavioral business on the part of payers to move patients to lower cost settings of care. And so we've been under pressure and none of this is new to discharge patients as soon as clinically appropriate, and I think we would argue in some cases even before it's clinically appropriate to move patients into outpatient settings or group homes or whatever it may be. But again, when I say that the underlying demand remains strong, Josh, I think we measure it by -- we've talked a little bit about this concept I think on previous calls. We measure something we call deflections, which is when a patient is presented to us and they meet clinical criteria and they have some appropriate level of payment and effectively, are eligible for admissions and we're unable to admit them, either because historically the main reason we couldn't admit them is we didn't have a bed available in certain markets and certain hospital and more recently, in the last year or so because we didn't have sufficient number of staff. But the number of deflections remain high. The number of patients who are being presented to us and meet the criteria to be admitted remains quite high. And those patients are being, again, deflected or turned away. And I think in a lot of these markets where our labor shortage is the issue, we think they're being turned away from multiple facilities. In other words, they're not finding treatment anywhere. And so, and again, I think of a scenario that you presented is perfectly legitimate and it's been occurring and frankly, it's been occurring for a long time. I don't think it's necessarily accelerated or terribly new in its form but I think that the underlying -- my view would be the underlying demand remains quite strong despite those efforts."

I mean if you look at our acute care revenue growth in those 4 or 5 quarters subsequent to that, we've been pretty consistently posting again at least at sort of 6% revenue growth which is kind of have split pretty evenly between volume and price. And in fact in many quarters, including this most recent quarter, we've been exceeding that. So yes, I mean I think our confidence level that we can continue that, that level of growth for our facilities in our markets is sustainable, is a reasonable one. It's not sort of pie in the sky. We've been posting those numbers and we don't see anything on the horizon that really threatens that. Yes, the comments I was making about payer mix, was that the government payer mix team to be moving in sort of lockstep with our overall growth. Commercial growth has slowed some, uninsured growth has increased some, I think that's a reflection of some of the premium increases and exchange, disenrollment that others have mentioned that we -- that people have been talking about. I think that's been factored into our numbers and again, I think that's already reflected in the growth that we've been able to achieve.

The upside of that business is somewhat limited because basically for the most part, they're just earning a management fee and they're really not able to generally share in the economics of the units that they're running. But we certainly are using that Horizon sort of foundation, if you will, as a base to talk to both their existing clients as well as their prospects. They certainly have had a robust business development sort of function for years that is very helpful because they really -- what they are focused on our these acute care hospital behavioral units.

We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $157.2 million or $1.60 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015. 
  
On a same facility basis in our acute care division, net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 increased 9.0% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On the same facility basis, operating margins for our acute-care hospitals decreased to 14.7% during the third quarter of 2016 from 15.3% during the third quarter of 2015. 
On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.7% during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. During this year's third quarter, adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities increased 1.1%, and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5% as compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 26.0% and 27.4% during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 38% to $1.1 billion over the $796 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2015. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45.3%. We spent $148 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2016 and $396 million during the first 9 months of 2016. 
Included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to the newly built Henderson Hospital, a 142-bed acute care facility located in Henderson, Nevada, which has been completed and is scheduled to open next week. We have also completed construction on a new 55-bed 4-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was opened during the third quarter of this year. 
As previously announced in August of this year, we purchased Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed facility located in Pahrump, Nevada. Together with our 5 existing acute-care facilities in the market, Henderson Hospital and Desert View Hospital further complement our ability to provide a wide array of comprehensive medical services to patients in the Las Vegas, Nevada area.
Within our Behavioral Health division, we have opened a total of 373 new beds at some of our busiest facilities during the first 9 months of 2016. In addition, we have been working on joint venture behavioral health integration projects with industry leaders throughout the country. We're excited about these partnerships that help address the growing demand for inpatient and outpatient mental health services. We are proud to be partnering with Lancaster General Health and Penn Medicine to build and operate a 126-bed behavioral health hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Groundbreaking of this facility is slated for the spring of 2017, and the hospital is projected to open during the summer of 2018. 
In addition, we have formed a joint venture with Providence Health Care to build a 100-bed freestanding behavioral health hospital in Spokane, Washington. In connection with our previously announced $800 million stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 458,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $58 million during the third quarter of this year. Since the inception of the program through September 30, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $462 million, and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $338 million as of the end of the third quarter. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months in 2016, we're narrowing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.16 to $7.43 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This narrowed guidance, which excludes the reported electronic -- the expected electronic health records impact for the year increases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 1%, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 2%. We'll be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I think from the beginning, Justin, and the beginning, and I think in my mind was just the third quarter of last year. So we've been talking about muted volumes in the behavioral business for about a year now, largely driven by staffing shortages, shortages of psychiatrists and nurses. I think it started out as more of a psychiatrist kind of centered problem, and has evolved into a more of a nursing shortage problem. But I think what we have highlighted, and there's no sort of perfect way to kind of parse this issue, but we identified 4 or 5 or 6 markets that were most problematic in terms of having vacancies for these clinical positions and having to turn away patients, and as a consequence, have significantly and measurably muted volumes in those markets because we simply didn't have enough qualified clinical professionals to treat those patients. Over the course of the year, I think the markets have largely remained the same. We think those markets probably encompass, depending on how you count them, some 20-odd facilities. And again, during the 12 months, maybe a facility sort of entered the list or came off the list, but I think for the most part, the list remains the same. I think we've seen some improvement in those markets. Sort of by definition, I think our overall volumes are increasing a little bit. I think we see pockets of weakness in some of the other markets. But I think, for the most part, we continue to believe that if we focus on the 4 or 5 most problematic markets, as we have been, that we'll continue to make progress. I think -- and you alluded to this a little bit, I think in your question, I think the third quarter was a bit of a -- kind of a whipsaw for us in the sense that as we are hiring new nurses, as we're paying sign-on bonuses, as we're investing in the sort of recruitment and retention of nurses, our labor costs are going up. We clearly saw that in Q3, and honestly, our volumes are going up a little bit, but they're not responding as quickly. Part of this is just a mechanical sort of a process as we hire nurses. They have to get notice at their old jobs if they're coming from another employer, then they join us, and they go through an orientation or training, and so we're paying them, and we're incurring costs, but we're not necessarily able to increase volumes immediately. And I think what you saw in Q3 was a little bit of that sort of dynamic of increased cost without the complete benefit of the commensurate increase in volumes. We think that's a relatively temporary situation that should continue to improve pretty measurably over the next quarter or 2."

Can you talk about the pace of improvement, and how you think it gets -- when you think it gets back to that target 5% -- 4% to 5%, 6% same-store revenue growth range? And then given the level of spending, can you walk us through what you would think would be a reasonable equation, let's just say, for 2017, in terms of the -- if same-store growth is 4%, 5%, what does that equate to in terms of EBITDA growth when you get there?"

I think, for the most part, we've been hitting those pricing targets, so this really is a volume issue. And so when you parse those numbers, we are somewhere 200, 250 basis points short of volumes from where we thought we would be. We also thought that if we could get to that 5% volume growth, we would get to something like a 6% or 7% expansion of EBITDA or growth in EBITDA. And I think that those -- that assumption and that EBITDA growth already presumed because when we gave our guidance for the year, we were certainly well aware of the labor shortage already at that time. So I think it presume that we would be raising salaries. We would be spending and investing more money in recruitment and retention, and so that EBITDA growth, in comparison to the revenue growth, was already sort of factoring in some amount of labor pressure. So really, I think the question you're asking, which is a perfectly reasonable one, is when do we get this additional 200, 250 basis points in volume. I think we feel like we're doing most of the right things. I think we feel like we're making progress. I think we feel like, at some point next year, in 2017, we will get there. Exactly how quickly we get there, exactly when that improvement comes, and how quickly that improvement comes, is difficult to say. Obviously, the next time we speak to this group will be in late February when we give our 2017 guidance. I think we'll be in a much better position to be more precise at that time, but I think we certainly feel that the metrics that we laid out for this year are well within reach, and certainly achievable at some point during 2017."

I think on the acute side, I think the challenge has mostly been the use of what we describe as premium pay. And that is paying either our own nurses overtime or shift differentials or whatever to work additional or incremental shifts or paying temporary or registry nurses generally a fairly significant premium over what would be our normal rate of pay. And that's really what's driving up our average wage rates. I don't think our underlying sort of, I'll call them, normalized wage rates, I would say, on the acute division are going up much more than sort of 3%, 3.5%. Maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we might have thought a year ago but not a huge needle mover. Just I think as sort of to put it in context, I think in normal -- in sort of a normal environment, we would expect the use of temporary nurses to represent something in any given quarter around 2% of our overall labor force. I think in this quarter, that number was between 2 and 3x that. And even that doesn't seem -- it seems like it's relatively small numbers. Because you're paying those temporary nurses, in many cases, twice what you're paying a regular nurse, the impact starts to add up relatively quickly. Same thing I think is true on the behavioral side. The real issue -- and if you've looked at our segment data for the last 4 quarters or so, you don't see a lot of pressure on our wage line in behavioral. And that's because quite frankly, we've just been unable to find sufficient number of nurses. It's really not been a question of willingness to pay them or to use temporary nurses or whatever. It's just been an absolute inability to find them at all, especially in these markets that I alluded to before. So I'm going to say the same thing, I mean, I think wage rates in the -- underlying wage rates in the behavioral division are maybe going up at this point, 2.5% or 3%. And maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we thought. But I don't think it's driving the numbers measurably, other than what I said before. I think already our EBITDA growth targets that we already had talked about for 2016 for both divisions, I think, already incorporated some amount of this labor pressure that we've been talking about."

Our adjusted admissions in the quarter were up about 4.5%. I think our government admissions were up in that neighborhood. Commercial admissions, while up, were up slightly less than that, maybe 1%, 1.5%. And then I think on insured admissions, we're up a little bit more than the average, probably in the 6%, 7% range. And again, these are all trends that, I think, we've talked about for, I would say, since the middle of last year. As the benefits of the ACA have started to anniversary, we're not continuing to get that benefit of increased Medicaid -- from increased Medicaid expansion. Continued commercial enrollment, as a matter of fact, I think we're seeing some level of disenrollment as premiums rise and other factors occur. So I think all that payer mix sort of trending has been ongoing for about a year now. We see some volatility between quarters. But if you look at the 4- or 5-month trend, I think you'll see that we've been hitting that sort of 3% revenue per admission growth rate pretty consistently over that period of time."

And a number of these arrangements have already been entered into and some of them are already in operation. I think that the first few of the arrangements that we entered into were just these sort of lease arrangements, where we would joint venture with large not-for-profit health care systems. I mentioned in my opening remarks a deal to build a new hospital with Providence in the Washington state market. But we already have 2 other arrangements, where we just occupied existing units, which we lease from Providence and run behavioral units there. And both of them are ongoing for some time and have been incorporated in our results for some time. Overall, it is a significant focus, probably from a business development perspective, the single biggest focus in the behavioral division. This is what we describe as acute care integration efforts. And so I think that they will continue and will continue to enter into new ones. Exactly how significant they'll be, I think, remains to be seen. And some of them will take some time to develop. I mentioned the Lancaster General joint venture in my remarks. But that hospital, new hospital, will not open until 2018. I think when we give our guidance for 2017, we will probably sort of frame it as here's our same-store expectations in terms of volume and revenue growth, and then we will probably separately spike out what the impact of these new ventures will be.

I mean, when we identify those 4, 5, 6 markets and the 20-or-so hospitals, the way that we identify them or the criteria we use was that in those hospitals, we had actually closed a unit or closed a number of beds or we capped our census so that in an 80-bed hospital, we were capping or limiting our census to, let's say, 40 patients or whatever the amount of sort of qualified nurses we had would limit us to. Certainly, elsewhere in the portfolio, we were facing some pressures of turning away a patient on this day or not having enough nurses on a particular day. But these were hospitals where again we had closed a unit or we had capped our census for an extended period of time. And that's how we were categorizing them. I think at those hospitals -- and I don't have the occupancy data in front of me, Paula. But I will say that at those hospitals on average, I think their patient days or their volumes were down during this period, I would say, 10% to 15%. And again, I think that the bulk of the effort to get the division back to the 200, 250 basis point shortage in volumes that we're really facing from our original guidance is getting those hospitals back to kind of the 3% or 4% volume growth that we think most of the rest of the portfolio is posting. Obviously, if we can't get those hospitals back to that level and we can get the remaining 180 hospitals or whatever the exact number is to increase their volumes by 25 or 50 basis points, I mean, that will get us to the same place. But I think we just try to frame it that way because I think frankly it helped us as we tried to focus on addressing this problem and we thought it would help people understand that. As with many things, this was really kind of an 80-20 issue. And the bulk of our focus was on a relatively small number of markets and facilities that were facing the most dramatic shortages."

But I think when we give our guidance in 2017, it will reflect the fact that we believe: a, the business is going to continue to grow; and b, that we'll continue to find new ways to enter markets, particularly acute care hospital market, and help to penetrate their behavioral services, which will also help the business grow."

So the IMD, the lifting of the IMD exclusion for the managed Medicaid population could occur as early as July of '16 [ph], if the states approved that. And I think some of our states have done so. I think we always had the view that the immediate impact of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, particularly in sort of a midyear cycle, was going to be fairly minimal because networks were already established, a benefit plan design was already established. And to have effectively new hospitals join the network midyear and to really redirect a substantial number of patients was not a terribly practical matter in the middle of the year. So I think in that sense, we always had the view that beginning with a new plan year in January of '17, we would get more of a measurable impact. And the reality is some states will not approve the lifting until July of '17, so some of this may be delayed even until '18. I think, however, our view of this has also evolved to, and this really encompasses my previous remarks, to believe that really the greatest opportunity we have here to take advantage of that adult Medicaid population are these arrangements that we will reach collaboratively with acute care hospitals to joint venture with them, to lease beds from them, to help them manage units because that -- those opportunities will give us access, not only to their adult Medicaid patient population but also to their commercial population, to their Medicare population. And so in some respects, the opportunity that we're pursuing through that avenue is even greater than the IMD opportunity. Although in fairness, it will take some time to realize as we have to negotiate these arrangements and implement them and in some cases, build new capacity or in some cases, renovate existing capacity. So there's some time lags in all this. But ultimately, given the fact that half of all the behavioral beds in the U.S. reside in acute care hospitals, we think that this opportunity to penetrate those beds is a tremendous and, as I remarked before, probably the single biggest business development opportunity we have domestically over the next 5 years or so."

So look, I think the reality is I don't know that we have kind of a terribly sort of insightful view of how this is all going to play out. I will make just some preliminary comments that we have said from the very beginning of the Affordable Care Act that the bulk of the benefit that we've realized from the Affordable Care Act tended to be on the Medicaid expansion side of the ACA. I think on a percentage basis, we had more hospital beds in expansion states than any of our peers, mostly because of our significant oversized presence in Nevada. But obviously, we benefited in California, we benefited in the District of Columbia. The amount of benefit that we got from commercial exchange enrollment was always more limited. And so to the degree that there is some level of disenrollment, which I think there is and probably will continue to be, I think, will impact us but will not impact us in a terribly material and measurable way. And I think it's also worth noting that we've said from the outset that I think the ACA has had a relatively minor impact on the behavioral business. And so again, I think to the degree that there is disruption in the markets, that there is disenrollment, that there's a limiting number of payers remaining, I don't think that's going to have a measurable impact on us. I will say that in most of our markets, there still are multiple exchange providers in business. And a Blue Cross plan almost inevitably is one of them. But even though we've seen some players leave the market, I think in most of our markets, there remains some level of choice and competition. So I think that is helpful."

The acute results have been choppier and a little bit more volatile than the behavioral results, I think. And I've encouraged people not to look at a particular quarter as sort of reflective or emblematic of the trajectory but to look at the last 4 or 5 quarters combined. And I think if you look at the business that way, we have been pretty routinely hitting at least that 6% revenue growth target. And I think during that period, we do also have margin expansion.

Some of them are 80-20 deals, where we're the 80% partner. Again, I think one of the things that were willing to do is to provide these acute care hospitals with a lot of optionality as to how we can proceed. And we'd love to have all the economics where -- but if we have an acute care partner who wants to retain a significant amount of economics, we can reach an agreement on that.

And look, this is not exclusive to the behavioral business, but certainly in the behavioral business, on the part of payers to move patients to lower-cost settings of care.

And none of this is new to discharge patients as soon as clinically appropriate, and I think we would argue in some cases, even before it's clinically appropriate to move patients into outpatient settings or group homes or whatever it may be. But again, when I say that the underlying demand remains strong, Josh, I think we measure it by -- we've talked a little bit about this concept, I think, on previous calls. We measure something we call deflections, which is when a patient is presented to us and they meet clinical criteria and they have some appropriate level of payment and effectively are eligible for admissions and we're unable to admit them, either because historically the main reason we couldn't admit them is we didn't have a bed available in certain markets and certain hospital and more recently, in the last year or so, because we didn't have sufficient number of staff. But the number of deflections remain high. The number of patients who are being presented to us and meet the criteria to be admitted remains quite high. And those patients are being again deflected or turned away. And I think in a lot of these markets where a labor shortage is the issue, we think they're being turned away from multiple facilities. In other words, they're not finding treatment anywhere. And so again, I think that the scenario that you present is perfectly legitimate and it's been occurring and frankly it's been occurring for a long time. I don't think it's necessarily accelerated or is terribly new in its form. But I think that the underlying -- my view would be the underlying demand remains quite strong despite those efforts."

And then obviously, we acquired Horizon as part of the PSI acquisition. And we continue to run that Horizon business and they continue to have -- I'm doing this off the top of my head, but something like 100 of these contracts around the country, where they're managing behavioral units for acute care hospitals. The upside of that business is somewhat limited because basically for the most part, they're just earning a management fee and they're really not able to generally share in the economics of the units that they're running. But we certainly are using that Horizon sort of foundation, if you will, as a base to talk to both their existing clients as well as their prospects. They certainly have had a robust business development sort of function for years that is very helpful because they really -- what they are focused on are these acute care hospital, behavioral units. And so as we can -- our focus expands to those businesses, the Horizon knowledge and database is quite useful. So yes, I mean, we're leveraging that platform to effectively, I think, create a newer business model that allows us to participate in more of the economics of those acute care, behavioral businesses. But yes, having Horizon is certainly a helpful dynamic."

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $157.2 million or $1.60 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015. 
  
On a same facility basis in our acute care division, net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 increased 9.0% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 14.7% during the third quarter of 2016 from 15.3% during the third quarter of 2015. 
On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.7% during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. During this year's third quarter, adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities increased 1.1%, and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5% as compared to last year's third quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 26.0% and 27.4% during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 38% to $1.1 billion over the $796 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2015. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45.3%. 
We spent $148 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2016 and $396 million during the first 9 months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the newly built Henderson Hospital, a 142-bed acute care facility located in Henderson, Nevada, which has been completed and is scheduled to open next week. We have also completed construction on a new 55-bed, 4-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was opened during the third quarter of this year. 
As previously announced in August of this year, we purchased Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed facility located in Pahrump, Nevada. Together with our 5 existing acute care facilities in the market, Henderson Hospital and Desert View Hospital further complement our ability to provide a wide array of comprehensive medical services to patients in the Las Vegas, Nevada area.
Within our Behavioral Health division, we have opened a total of 373 new beds at some of our busiest facilities during the first 9 months of 2016. In addition, we have been working on joint venture behavioral health integration projects with industry leaders throughout the country. We're excited about these partnerships that help address the growing demand for inpatient and outpatient mental health services. We are proud to be partnering with Lancaster General Health and Penn Medicine to build and operate a 126-bed behavioral health hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Groundbreaking of this facility is slated for the spring of 2017, and the hospital is projected to open during the summer of 2018. 
In addition, we have formed a joint venture with Providence Health Care to build a 100-bed freestanding behavioral health hospital in Spokane, Washington. 
In connection with our previously announced $800 million stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 458,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $58 million during the third quarter of this year. Since the inception of the program through September 30, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $462 million, and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $338 million as of the end of the third quarter. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2016, we're narrowing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.16 to $7.43 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This narrowed guidance, which excludes the reported electronic -- the expected electronic health records impact for the year increases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 1%, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 2%. We'll be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

But I think what we have highlighted, and there's no sort of perfect way to kind of parse this issue, but we identified 4 or 5 or 6 markets that were most problematic in terms of having vacancies for these clinical positions and having to turn away patients and as a consequence have significantly and measurably muted volumes in those markets because we simply didn't have enough qualified clinical professionals to treat those patients. 
Over the course of the year, I think the markets have largely remained the same. We think those markets probably encompass, depending on how you count them, some 20-odd facilities. And again, during the 12 months, maybe a facility sort of entered the list or came off the list, but I think for the most part the list remained the same. 
I think we've seen some improvement in those markets. Sort of by definition, I think our overall volumes are increasing a little bit. I think we see pockets of weakness in some of the other markets. But I think, for the most part, we continue to believe that if we focus on the 4 or 5 most problematic markets, as we have been, that we'll continue to make progress. 
I think, and you alluded to this a little bit, I think, in your question, I think the third quarter was a bit of a -- kind of a whipsaw for us in the sense that as we are hiring new nurses, as we're paying sign-on bonuses, as we're investing in the sort of recruitment and retention of nurses, our labor costs are going up. We clearly saw that in Q3. And honestly, our volumes are going up a little bit but they're not responding as quickly. Part of this is just a mechanical sort of a process. As we hire nurses, they have to give notice at their old jobs if they're coming from another employer. Then they join us, and they go through an orientation or a training, and so we're paying them and we're incurring costs, but we're not necessarily able to increase volumes immediately. And I think what you saw in Q3 was a little bit of that sort of dynamic of increased cost without the complete benefit of the commensurate increase in volumes. We think that's a relatively temporary situation that should continue to improve pretty measurably over the next quarter or 2."

I think, for the most part, we've been hitting those pricing targets, so this really is a volume issue. And so when you parse those numbers, we are somewhere 200, 250 basis points short of volumes from where we thought we would be. 
We also thought that if we could get to that 5% volume growth we would get to something like a 6% or 7% expansion of EBITDA, or growth in EBITDA. And I think that those -- that assumption and that EBITDA growth already presumed, because when we gave our guidance for the year we were certainly well aware of the labor shortage already at that time, so I think it presumed that we would be raising salaries, we would be spending and investing more money in recruitment and retention. And so that EBITDA growth, in comparison to the revenue growth, was already sort of factoring in some amount of labor pressure. 
So really, I think the question you're asking, which is a perfectly reasonable one, is when do we get this additional 200, 250 basis points in volume. I think we feel like we're doing most of the right things. I think we feel like we're making progress. I think we feel like at some point next year, in 2017, we will get there. Exactly how quickly we get there, exactly when that improvement comes and how quickly that improvement comes is difficult to say. Obviously, the next time we speak to this group will be in late February when we give our 2017 guidance. I think we'll be in a much better position to be more precise at that time. But I think we certainly feel that the metrics that we laid out for this year are well within reach and certainly achievable at some point during 2017."

I think on the acute side, I think the challenge has mostly been the use of what we describe as premium pay. And that is paying either our own nurses overtime or shift differentials or whatever to work additional or incremental shifts or paying temporary or registry nurses generally a fairly significant premium over what would be our normal rate of pay. And that's really what's driving up our average wage rates. I don't think our underlying, sort of, I'll call them normalized wage rates, I would say, in the acute division are going up much more than sort of 3%, 3.5%. Maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we might have thought a year ago but not a huge needle mover. 
Just I think as sort of to put it in context, I think in normal -- in sort of a normal environment, we would expect the use of temporary nurses to represent something in any given quarter around 2% of our overall labor force. I think in this quarter, that number was between 2 and 3x that. And even though that doesn't seem -- it seems like it's relatively small numbers, but because you're paying those temporary nurses in many cases twice what you're paying a regular nurse, the impact starts to add up relatively quickly. 
Same thing I think is true on the behavioral side. The real issue -- and if you've looked at our segment data for the last 4 quarters or so, you don't see a lot of pressure on our wage line in behavioral. And that's because, quite frankly, we've just been unable to find sufficient number of nurses. It's really not been a question of willingness to pay them or to use temporary nurses or whatever. It's just been an absolute inability to find them at all, especially in these markets that I alluded to before. 
So I'm going to say the same thing. I mean, I think wage rates in the -- underlying wage rates in the behavioral division are maybe going up at this point 2.5% or 3%. And maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we thought. But I don't think it's driving the numbers measurably, other than what I said before. I think already our EBITDA growth targets that we already had talked about for 2016 for both divisions I think already incorporated some amount of this labor pressure that we've been talking about."

Our adjusted admissions for the quarter were up about 4.5%. I think our government admissions were up in that neighborhood. Commercial admissions, while up, were up slightly less than that, maybe 1%, 1.5%. And then I think on insured admissions were up a little bit more than the average, probably in the 6%, 7% range. And again, these are all trends that I think we've talked about for, I would say, since the middle of last year. As the benefits of the ACA have started to anniversary, we're not continuing to get that benefit of increased Medicaid -- from increased Medicaid expansion. Continued commercial enrollment, as a matter of fact, I think we're seeing some level of disenrollment as premiums rise and other factors occur. 
So I think all that payer mix sort of trending has been ongoing for about a year now. We see some volatility between quarters. But if you look at the 4- or 5-month trend, I think you'll see that we've been hitting that sort of 3% revenue per admission growth rate pretty consistently over that period of time."

And a number of these arrangements have already been entered into and some of them are already in operation. I think that the first few of the arrangements that we entered into were just these sort of lease arrangements, where we would joint venture with large not-for-profit health care systems. I mentioned in my opening remarks a deal to build a new hospital with Providence in the Washington state market. But we already have 2 other arrangements where we just occupied existing units which we lease from Providence and run behavioral units there. And both of them are ongoing for some time and have been incorporated in our results for some time. 
Overall, it is a significant focus, probably from a business development perspective the single biggest focus in the behavioral division. This is what we describe as acute care integration efforts. And so I think that they will continue and will continue to enter into new ones. Exactly how significant they'll be I think remains to be seen. And some of them will take some time to develop. I mentioned the Lancaster General joint venture in my remarks. But that hospital, new hospital will not open until 2018. 
I think when we give our guidance for 2017, we will probably sort of frame it as here's our same-store expectations in terms of volume and revenue growth, and then we will probably separately spike out what the impact of these new ventures will be.

I mean, when we identified those 4, 5, 6 markets and the 20-or-so hospitals, the way that we identified them or the criteria we used was that in those hospitals we had actually closed a unit or closed a number of beds or we capped our census so that in an 80-bed hospital we were capping or limiting our census to, let's say, 40 patients, or whatever the amount of sort of qualified nurses we had would limit us to. 
Certainly, elsewhere in the portfolio we were facing some pressures of turning away a patient on this day or not having enough nurses on a particular day. But these were hospitals where, again, we had closed a unit or we had capped our census for an extended period of time. And that's how we were categorizing them. I think at those hospitals -- and I don't have the occupancy data in front of me, Paula, but I will say that at those hospitals on average, I think their patient days or their volumes were down during this period, I would say 10% to 15%. And again, I think that the bulk of the effort to get the division back to the 200, 250 basis point shortage in volumes that we're really facing from our original guidance is getting those hospitals back to kind of the 3% or 4% volume growth that we think most of the rest of the portfolio is posting. 
Obviously, if we can't get those hospitals back to that level and we can get the remaining 180 hospitals or whatever the exact number is to increase their volumes by 25 or 50 basis points, I mean, that will get us to the same place. But I think we just tried to frame it that way because I think, frankly, it helped us as we tried to focus on addressing this problem and we thought it would help people understand that, as with many things, this was really kind of an 80-20 issue and the bulk of our focus was on a relatively small number of markets and facilities that were facing the most dramatic shortages."

And instead, we're focused on what we believe is a much more near-term issue of making sure that we have, again, enough qualified staff in all of our facilities to satisfy that demand. 
I think that obviously, and as you pointed out, I mean, the fact that we're adding beds -- and obviously, we're adding beds in markets where we do have enough qualified staff and we can accommodate those patients. And we're not necessarily adding beds in those markets where we don't have enough staff. Now at some point, we may add beds in those markets as we resolve the problem.

So the IMD, the lifting of the IMD exclusion for the managed Medicaid population could occur as early as July of '16 (sic) [ '17 ] if the states approved that. And I think some of our states have done so. I think we always had the view that the immediate impact of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, particularly in sort of a midyear cycle, was going to be fairly minimal because networks were already established, a benefit plan design was already established, and to have effectively new hospitals join the network midyear and to really redirect a substantial number of patients was not a terribly practical matter in the middle of the year. So I think in that sense, we always had the view that beginning with a new plan year in January of '17 we would get more of a measurable impact. 
And the reality is some states will not approve the lifting until July of '17, so some of this may be delayed even until '18. 
I think, however, our view of this has also evolved to, and this really encompasses my previous remarks, to believe that really the greatest opportunity we have here to take advantage of that adult Medicaid population are these arrangements that we will reach collaboratively with acute care hospitals to joint venture with them, to lease beds from them, to help them manage units because that -- those opportunities will give us access, not only to their adult Medicaid patient population but also to their commercial population, to their Medicare population. And so in some respects, the opportunity that we're pursuing through that avenue is even greater than the IMD opportunity. Although in fairness, it will take some time to realize as we have to negotiate these arrangements and implement them and in some cases build new capacity or in some cases renovate existing capacity. So there's some time lags in all this. But ultimately, given the fact that half of all the behavioral beds in the U.S. reside in acute care hospitals, we think that this opportunity to penetrate those beds is a tremendous and, as I remarked before, probably the single biggest business development opportunity we have domestically over the next 5 years or so."

So look, I think the reality is I don't know that we have kind of a terribly sort of insightful view of how this is all going to play out. I will make just some preliminary comments that we have said from the very beginning of the Affordable Care Act that the bulk of the benefit that we've realized from the Affordable Care Act tended to be on the Medicaid expansion side of the ACA. I think on a percentage basis, we had more hospital beds in expansion states than any of our peers, mostly because of our significant oversized presence in Nevada. But obviously, we benefited in California, we benefited in the District of Columbia. The amount of benefit that we got from commercial exchange enrollment was always more limited. And so to the degree that there is some level of disenrollment, which I think there is and probably will continue to be, I think will impact us but will not impact us in a terribly material and measurable way. 
And I think it's also worth noting that we've said from the outset that I think the ACA has had a relatively minor impact on the behavioral business. And so again, I think to the degree that there is disruption in the markets, that there is disenrollment, that there's a limiting number of payers remaining, I don't think that's going to have a measurable impact on us. I will say that in most of our markets there still are multiple exchange providers in business. And a Blue Cross plan almost inevitably is one of them. But even though we've seen some players leave the market, I think in most of our markets there remains some level of choice and competition. So I think that is helpful."

And I've encouraged people not to look at a particular quarter as sort of reflective or emblematic of the trajectory but to look at the last 4 or 5 quarters combined. And I think if you look at the business that way, we have been pretty routinely hitting at least that 6% revenue growth target. And I think during that period we do also have margin expansion. Again, I don't think we're going to have it every single quarter. I think there will be some quarters that will be tighter than others. But I think over time, those metrics that I laid out are still very sustainable from our point of view."

Everyone is different. I described a number of arrangements we have where we simply lease beds from an acute care hospital and run a behavioral unit effectively in their building or on their campus. And in those cases, we take on all the economics other than paying them a lease payment. In the deals that I described in my remarks, we're building new facilities. And in each of those cases, I think the acute care partner will contribute their percentage of the capital investment. And the partnership percentages vary. Some of these are 50-50 deals. Some of them are 80-20 deals where we're the 80% partner. Again, I think one of the things that we're willing to do is to provide these acute care hospitals with a lot of optionality as to how we can proceed. And we'd love to have all the economics where -- but if we have an acute care partner who wants to retain a significant amount of economics and we can reach an agreement on that, I think we're happy to do that. 
So I think you're going to see these deals take a lot of different forms. In the end, I think they all provide us an opportunity to broach a patient population that we've just never been able to really penetrate before in a meaningful way."

And in fact, I think we said at our September conferences that July and August volumes combined looked kind of where we expected they'd be. So I think other than that sort of dynamic, there was nothing about the sort of progression or trajectory of the quarter that was terribly noteworthy. 
Look, I think the take on our guidance from my perspective was we were a little bit short of our own internal projections for the quarter. I think the midpoint of the revised guidance presumes that the trends for Q3 sort of just continue into Q4 and we'd probably be a little bit short again in Q4. If things improve and we're able to make some improvements, some more immediate improvements in both of the businesses, we should be able to gravitate towards the higher end of the range.

And look, this is not exclusive to the behavioral business, but certainly in the behavioral business, on the part of payers to move patients to lower-cost settings of care. And so we've been under pressure, and none of this is new, to discharge patients as soon as is clinically appropriate, and I think we would argue in some cases even before it's clinically appropriate, to move patients into outpatient settings or group homes or whatever it may be. 
But again, when I say that the underlying demand remains strong, Josh, I think we measure it by -- we've talked a little bit about this concept, I think, on previous calls. We measure something we call deflections, which is when a patient is presented to us and they meet clinical criteria and they have some appropriate level of payment and effectively are eligible for admissions and we're unable to admit them, either because -- historically the main reason we couldn't admit them is we didn't have a bed available in certain markets and certain hospitals and more recently, in the last year or so, because we didn't have sufficient number of staff. But the number of deflections remain high. The number of patients who are being presented to us and meet the criteria to be admitted remains quite high. And those patients are being, again, deflected or turned away. And I think in a lot of these markets where a labor shortage is the issue, we think they're being turned away from multiple facilities. In other words, they're not finding treatment anywhere. 
And so again, I think that the scenario that you present is perfectly legitimate and it's been occurring and, frankly, it's been occurring for a long time. I don't think it's necessarily accelerated or is terribly new in its form. But I think that the underlying -- my view would be the underlying demand remains quite strong despite those efforts."

The comments I was making about payer mix was that the government payer mix seems to be sort of moving in sort of lockstep with our overall growth. Commercial growth has slowed some.

And I think if you go back and you look not just at this quarter but at the last 4 or 5 quarters, you will see that we're doing both of those things. We're growing revenue by at least 6% and we are expanding margins. It is, and I can see this, it is somewhat choppy, it's somewhat volatile. There are some quarters where there's margin contraction, et cetera. But I think over that period of time we've been able to achieve those metrics. And I think our point of view is that going forward we'll continue to be able to achieve those metrics."

Well, I guess, when you talk about JVs, are you talking about doing a JV with 1 of the 1,200 hospitals that has a unit already and moving it out? Or are you talking to the 3,800 hospitals that don't even have a capability and building something from scratch? Because it seems like the 3,800 is the bigger opportunity of trying to collect that volume. How do you think about that?"

We may be getting some of their other patients. And so I think, yes, I think our point of view is that the way to penetrate that adult Medicaid business is to go where those patients are being treated today, and that is in the 1,200 or so acute hospitals that have a behavioral unit. We certainly are having conversations with those other hospitals. And honestly, I think we've been having conversations with them all along about referring patients from their EDs to our behavioral units, where we live in a market with them."
