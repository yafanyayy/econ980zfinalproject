I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial performance then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year  results. 2015 was a record for EBITDA in earnings for Tesoro. This performance demonstrates the value of our highly integrated business model and successful execution of our annual improvement plans. Fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $54 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $172 million or $1.34 per diluted share last year. Reported results for the quarter included inventory charge due to lower cost to market valuation adjustment of $167 million after-tax or $1.38 per diluted share. This adjustment is a result of the decline in crude oil and product prices relative to our LIFO carrying values. Excluding this item, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $221 million or $1.83 per diluted share. Reported results in the quarter included the following 3 items: $30 million or $0.15 a share from the impact of additional rent cost gross following the recently announced EPA requirements under the renewable fuel standard program; $24 million or $0.07 a share representing an increase in expected remediation costs associated with the 2013 crude oil pipeline release in North Dakota; and $15 million or $0.07 per diluted share of asset impairments due to the current crude oil price environment. Total corporate and unallocated costs for the fourth quarter were $97 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 million. The increase was primarily due to higher-than-expected accruals for some corporate expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $665 million, an increase of 29% from $570 million a year ago. For the full year 2015, net income's -- net earnings from continuing operations was $1.5 billion or $12.39 per diluted share versus $872 million or $6.67 per share a year ago. Excluding special items, net earnings for 2015 was $1.7 billion or $13.91 per diluted share compared to $911 million or $6.97 per diluted share for 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $3.9 billion, up 71% from $2.3 billion a year ago. 
Turning to our business segment results. Refining adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $414 million, an increase of 190% from $189 million a year ago. they are ago. Total refinery throughput for the fourth quarter was 807,000 barrels a day or 95% utilization. The Tesoro Index for the fourth quarter was $15.60 per barrel with the realized gross refining margin of $12.76 per barrel or 82% for the Tesoro Index. This quarter's capture rate was primarily impacted by narrowing crude oil differentials. For instance, Bakken differences in the quarter arrowed over $2 relative to WTI and almost $6 relative to ANS. Manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter increased $0.08 per barrel over last year to $5.62 due to unclaimed repairs and maintenance during the quarter. For full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for refining was $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 68%. Total refinery throughput for 2015 was 787,000 barrels a day or 93% utilization. The realized gross refining margin for 2015 was $16.22 a barrel or a capture of 84% of the Tesoro Index. 2015 capture rates were impacted by the labor disruptions in the first quarter, narrowed crude oil differentials, refinery downtime, inventory impacts related to falling crude oil prices and running more intermediate feedstock in refineries during turnarounds and maintenance. 
Moving to logistics. This segment's adjusted EBITDA was $155 million in the fourth quarter compared to $94 million a year ago. These results included charge of approximately $24 million were expected future remediation costs for the 2013 target North Dakota crude oil pipeline release. The substantial year-over-year increase in EBITDA was primarily driven by contributions from Rockies natural gas business, which delivered $285 million of EBITDA in 2015 and increased volumes through all -- business segments. Total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $42 million during the fourth quarter and $148 million for the year. This is an increase of $61 million or 70% versus full year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $636 million, up from $318 million last year. From our marketing segment, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $187 million compared to $273 million last year. The decline is largely attributed to lower marketing margins. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was a record $945 million, a year-over-year increase of 59% and was driven by strong growth in consumer demand that led to higher fuel volumes. Marketing integration increased to 94% for the year versus 86% a year ago. As a result of strong operational performance, annual improvement and favorable market conditions, Tesoro generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2015. 
Turning to uses of this free cash flow for 2015. We invested $550 million in high-return capital projects, repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares for $664 million, paid dividends of $228 million and repaid $398 million of secured debt at Tesoro. We remain committed to delivering strong free cash flow and allocating capital to create long-term value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing costs and other elements related to our first quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We achieved record EBIT",1010,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. 2015 was a strong year for the company with several accomplishments and significant progress on our growth plans despite the challenges that we experienced during the year -- in the year. We achieved record EBITDA in all business segment supported by strong consumer demand, favorable market conditions and our annual improvement program. In 2015, the Tesoro Index was $19.31 per barrel as a result of some of the unplanned operating issues in the industry on the West Coast. For 2016, we expected Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, which is an improvement of $1.50 to $2 per barrel versus 2014. The lower crude oil price environment is support -- product demand. For 2015, U.S. clean product demand was up approximately 2% year-over-year and PADD V product demand was up 2.5%. Vehicle miles traveled in PADD V has continued to outpace the U.S. average. In November, California miles traveled had a robust year-over-year growth rate of 6.7% comparing to the U.S. growth rate of 3.4%. 
Turning to our operations for the fourth quarter. Overall, we had a challenging December in our refining segment due to some unplanned downtime. In our West Coast region, the Los Angeles refinery experienced problems with both of the fluid catalytic crackers and this impacted our clean product yield. Our operations in the Mid-Continent in the Pacific Northwest had high utilization in the quarter. However, capture rates were impacted primarily by narrowing crude oil differentials. We were able to optimize our operations and achieve 90% -- 95% utilization, which was in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we completed the project to install -- recovery systems in our Salt Lake City and -- refinery. The $217 million in combined projects were delivered underbudget and on time, and these recovery systems allow us to reduce the amount of emissions and potential of current events at these refineries. 
Moving to our logistics segment. During 2015, we continue to execute our strategy to grow TLLP's integrated full-service statistics business. Volumes in all of our business segments continue to grow in the phase of a challenging and difficult commodity price environment. During 2015, our crude oil gathering volumes were up 37% year-over-year. Natural gas gathering volumes increased approximately 5% year-over-year, fee-based processing and NGL processing throughput increased approximately 8% and 20%, respectively; and terminaling volumes were up 4%, transportation pipeline volumes were up 3% year-over-year. We are very pleased with the performance of our Rockies natural gas business in 2015. For the full year, the Rockies natural gas business contributed $285 million of adjusted EBITDA, exceeding its target of $275 million. Based on the combined value of the acquisition of the Rockies natural gas business for $2.5 billion and the approximately $400 million value for the QEPM merger, TLLP realized an implied multiple of approximately 10x EBITDA in our first full calendar year of ownership. This was basically 1 year ahead of our original goal. Because of the successful integration, we were able to capture approximately $30 million of synergies in the full year 2015, exceeding our $25 million target. TLLP also announced several new organic growth projects that should position on TLLP for future growth. Additionally, TLLP continued to grow our portfolio of logistics assets through the acquisition of Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets acquisition from Tesoro in November of 2015. We remain committed to growing a full-service statistics business to our focus on 4 things: Growing and optimizing our stable fee-based business; expanding our backlog of high-return organic growth projects; pursuing strategic third-party acquisitions; and finally, providing future drop-down opportunities. 
Now turning to marketing. This segment contributed significantly to our performance for 2015. EBITDA was a record $945 million and the fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. In the fourth quarter, we improved our integration to 94% from 86% a year ago, increasing -- sales by about 1% and signed a strategic supply agreement with a key customer to sell fuel at 55 high-volume retail stations in the greater Los Vegas, Nevada area. 
Shifting to our annual improvements, we successfully executed our plans and estimate improvements of approximately $670 million versus our $550 million to $670 million goal. We delivered approximately $350 million in West Coast improvements in capturing margin improvements. These include pipeline connections between the Los Angeles refinery; new cargo sharing between our California refineries; the completion of the second phase expansion of the west crude project at our Salt Lake City refinery; improved crude planning processing at our Mandan refinery; and operating expense reductions. We also delivered approximately $320 million of logistics growth in 2015 against our target of $325 million to $375 million. Tesoro expects to deliver between $400 million and $500 million of annual improvement in 2016 through refining improvements of $200 million to $250 million from better flexibility and yields, optimization and cost management; logistics improvements of $175 million to $200 million through acquisition and organic growth projects; and marketing improvements of $25 million to $50 million through small acquisitions and organic growth. 
Additionally, we are making strategic investments that should add long-term value and are currently progressing well in the permitting process. This include the Los Angeles integration and compliance project, the Clean Product Upgrade Project on the West Coast and the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State Energy Valuation Council or EFSEC released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in November of 2015 and the public comment period closed January 22. Once EFSEC completes its final environmental impact statement and completes adjudicative phase, we expect EFSEC to submit its recommendations to the governor of Washington. We are very committed to the proposed 360,000-barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington and the West Coast. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on strong operating performance for 2016 and executing our annual improvements. And with that, we'll now take your questions. Operator?"

When you look at Q3 and we have a capture rate of about 90%, and in Q4, as we reported today, we came in about 82% and that's really driven primarily by what's happened with differentials. In particular, Mid-Continent, Bakken, Canadian crudes differentials came down substantially. As we look forward to the first quarter and into next year, as we said at Investor Day, we use a planning basis of transportation economics setting the differentials across the crude. So depending on your longer-term view, we still think that's fundamentally which offset our capture rate. And when they return to those levels, we think capture rate in the high 90s, 100% makes sense as we said in Investor Day. But clearly, right now, the markets, not pricing, the crude oil differentials at transportation. So we are seeing that headwind as we saw in the fourth quarter."

And we -- so we're always looking forward to -- we're not worried about just the day, but we're looking what our plans are for the next 12 to 24 months. And our priorities, they really haven't changed actually. The first priority is that we have very valuable strategic projects that we want to be able to drive a fundamental improvement in the overall profitability of the company. We've talked about those in the past. So we have a portfolio of those projects. Today, we have some larger projects that we've already mentioned. And then we always have a number of small ones that we kind of balance the amount of cash that we want to return the business, but we're very disciplined about putting a certain amount of cash back into the business that helps drive fundamental improvement over time so that we get that value from there. And then secondly, to be able to go in and maintain a very competitive dividend and then use the free cash flow to be able to then purchase stock back in that. So that's the drivers for us is we always look at what we have going on over the next 12 to sometimes as long as 24 months because the timing of major projects take a very balanced approach to managing the cash flow from the company."

So let me provide some clarity around how we're thinking about that. One, we truly, truly believe that there is incredible value in our integrated business model because of where we operate as a company. So that's very important. Two, marketing is a critical part of how we're able to drive high utilization in our refineries and that connection there. So then you look at our portfolio of marketing channels and you can call them whether they be company-owned and operated or a wholesale or a dealer channel that. So that's kind of always been -- our push has been to be able to grow that integration in marketing. So that's very important. Then the second thing is over time, we optimize that channel mix and part of that has been like take what's company-operated and go to this multisite operator, which basically allows someone else just to operate the stations but the financial drivers in that aren't significantly different as if we would to operate them ourselves. I think that's an important point. And then being able to go out and strengthen our portfolio of marketing channels by 1, the acquisition of the ARCO been was a significant enhancement to our marketing portfolio so it gives us that dealer channel in there. We did acquire some ARCO stations last year that fits in with our portfolio but that's an important part of it. Our company-owned but multisite operator model is a part of that, and then growing the wholesale channel is a part of that. So I don't think that we're continuing to strengthen the portfolio, and our plan that we laid out going forward is that by each region we want to be at least fully integrated with refining in some regions more integrated and being net buyers in the market and have a very good portfolio, which would be different by regions that allows the portfolio around each region to be driven by both return on invested capital on the profitability of the channel and then on the kind of the readability as it impacts refining. So long-winded answer to your question but that's how we look at it."

I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial performance, then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results. 2015 was a record for EBITDA and earnings for Tesoro. This performance demonstrates the value of our highly integrated business model and successful execution of our annual improvement plans. Fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $54 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $172 million or $1.34 per diluted share last year. Reported results for the quarter include an inventory charge due to a lower cost to market valuation adjustment of $167 million after-tax or $1.38 per diluted share. This adjustment is a result of the decline in crude oil and product prices relative to our LIFO carrying values. Excluding this item, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $221 million or $1.83 per diluted share. Reported results in the quarter include the following 3 items: $30 million or $0.15 a share from the impact of additional RIN cost accruals following the recently announced EPA requirements under the renewable fuel standard program; $24 million or $0.07 a share representing an increase in the expected remediation costs associated with the 2013 crude oil pipeline release at Tioga, North Dakota; and $15 million or $0.07 per diluted share of asset impairments due to the current crude oil price environment. Total corporate and unallocated costs for the fourth quarter were $97 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 million. The increase was primarily due to higher-than-expected accruals for some corporate expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $665 million, an increase of 29% from $570 million a year ago. For the full year 2015, net income's -- net earnings from continuing operations was $1.5 billion or $12.39 per diluted share versus $872 million or $6.67 per share a year ago. Excluding special items, net earnings for 2015 was $1.7 billion or $13.91 per diluted share compared to $911 million or $6.97 per diluted share for 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $3.9 billion, up 71% from $2.3 billion a year ago. 
Turning to our business segment results. Refining adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $414 million, an increase of 119% from $189 million a year ago. Total refinery throughput for the fourth quarter was 807,000 barrels a day or 95% utilization. The Tesoro Index for the fourth quarter was $15.60 per barrel with the realized gross refining margin of $12.76 per barrel or 82% for the Tesoro Index. This quarter's capture rate was primarily impacted by narrowing crude oil differentials. For instance, Bakken differences in the quarter narrowed over $2 relative to WTI and almost $6 relative to ANS. Manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter increased $0.08 per barrel over last year to $5.62 due to unclaimed repairs and maintenance during the quarter. For full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for refining was $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 68%. Total refinery throughput for 2015 was 787,000 barrels a day or 93% utilization. The realized gross refining margin for 2015 was $16.22 a barrel or a capture of 84% of the Tesoro Index. 2015 capture rates were impacted by the labor disruptions in the first quarter, narrowed crude oil differentials, refinery downtime, inventory impacts related to falling crude oil prices and running more intermediate feedstock in refineries during turnarounds and maintenance. 
Moving to logistics. This segment's adjusted EBITDA was $155 million in the fourth quarter compared to $94 million a year ago. These results include a charge of approximately $24 million for expected future remediation costs for the 2013 Tioga, North Dakota crude oil pipeline release. The substantial year-over-year increase in EBITDA was primarily driven by contributions from our Rockies natural gas business, which delivered $285 million of EBITDA in 2015, and increased volumes through all TLLP's business segments. Total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $42 million during the fourth quarter and $148 million for the year. This is an increase of $61 million or 70% versus full year 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $636 million, up from $318 million last year.
For our marketing segment, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $187 million compared to $273 million last year. The decline is largely attributed to lower marketing margins. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was a record $945 million, a year-over-year increase of 59% and was driven by strong growth in consumer demand that led to higher fuel volumes. Marketing integration increased to 94% for the year versus 86% a year ago. As a result of strong operational performance, annual improvements and favorable market conditions, Tesoro generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2015. 
Turning to uses of this free cash flow for 2015. We invested $550 million in high-return capital projects, repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares for $644 million, paid dividends of $228 million and repaid $398 million of secured debt at Tesoro. We remain committed to delivering strong free cash flow and allocating capital to create long-term value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, you could find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing costs and other elements related to our first quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We achieved record EBIT",1019,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. 2015 was a strong year for the company with several accomplishments and significant progress on our growth plans despite the challenges that we experienced during the year -- in the year. We achieved record EBITDA in all business segments, supported by strong consumer demand, favorable market conditions and our annual improvement program. In 2015, the Tesoro Index was $19.31 per barrel as a result of some of the unplanned operating issues in the industry on the West Coast. For 2016, we expect a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, which is an improvement of $1.50 to $2 per barrel versus 2014. The lower crude oil price environment is supportive to product demand. For 2015, U.S. clean product demand was up approximately 2% year-over-year, and PADD V clean product demand was up 2.5%. Vehicle miles traveled in PADD V has continued to outpace the U.S. average. In November, California miles traveled had a robust year-over-year growth rate of 6.7% compared to the U.S. growth rate of 3.4%. 
Turning to our operations for the fourth quarter. Overall, we had a challenging December in our refining segment due to some unplanned downtime. In our West Coast region, the Los Angeles refinery experienced problems with both of the fluid catalytic crackers and this impacted our clean product yield. Our operations in the Mid-Con and the Pacific Northwest had high utilization in the quarter. However, capture rates were impacted primarily by narrowing crude oil differentials. We were able to optimize our operations and achieved 90% -- 95% utilization, which was in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we completed the projects to install flare gas recovery systems at our Salt Lake City, Mandan and Anacortes refineries. The $217 million in combined projects were delivered under budget and on time, and these recovery systems allow us to reduce the amount of emissions and potential of flaring events at these refineries. 
Moving to our logistics segment. During 2015, we continued to execute our strategy to grow TLLP's integrated full-service logistics business. Volumes in all of our business segments continued to grow in the face of a challenging and difficult commodity price environment. During 2015, our crude oil gathering volumes were up 37% year-over-year; natural gas gathering volumes increased approximately 5% year-over-year; fee-based processing and NGL processing throughput increased approximately 8% and 20%, respectively; and terminaling volumes were up 4%; transportation pipeline volumes were up 3% year-over-year. We are very pleased with the performance of our Rockies natural gas business in 2015. For the full year, the Rockies natural gas business contributed $285 million of adjusted EBITDA, exceeding its target of $275 million. Based on the combined value of the acquisition of the Rockies natural gas business for $2.5 billion and the approximately $400 million value for the QEPM merger, TLLP realized an implied multiple of approximately 10x EBITDA in our first full calendar year of ownership. This was basically 1 year ahead of our original goal. Because of the successful integration, we were able to capture approximately $30 million of synergies in the full year 2015, exceeding our $25 million target. TLLP also announced several new organic growth projects that should position TLLP for future growth. Additionally, TLLP continued to grow our portfolio of logistics assets through the acquisition of a Los Angeles storage and pipeline asset acquisition from Tesoro in November of 2015. We remain committed to growing a full-service logistics business to our focus on 4 things: growing and optimizing our stable fee-based business; expanding our backlog of high-return organic growth projects; pursuing strategic third-party acquisitions; and finally, providing future drop-down opportunities. 
Now turning to marketing. This segment contributed significantly to our performance for 2015. EBITDA was a record $945 million, and the fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. In the fourth quarter, we improved our integration to 94% from 86% a year ago, increased same-store sales by about 1% and signed a strategic supply agreement with a key customer to sell fuel at 55 high-volume retail stations in the greater Los Vegas, Nevada area.
Shifting to our annual improvements. We successfully executed our plans and estimate improvements of approximately $670 million versus our $550 million to $670 million goal. We delivered approximately $350 million in West Coast improvements in capturing margin improvements. These include pipeline connections between the Los Angeles refinery; new cargo sharing between our California refineries; the completion of a second phase expansion of the waxy crude project at our Salt Lake City refinery; improved crude blending processing at our Mandan refinery; and operating expense reductions. We also delivered approximately $320 million of logistics growth in 2015 against our target of $325 million to $375 million. Tesoro expects to deliver between $400 million and $500 million of annual improvements in 2016 through refining improvements of $200 million to $250 million from better flexibility and yields, optimization and cost management; logistics improvements of $175 million to $200 million through acquisitions and organic growth projects; and marketing improvements of $25 million to $50 million through small acquisitions and organic growth. 
Additionally, we are making strategic investments that should add long-term value and are currently progressing well in the permitting process. These include the Los Angeles integration and compliance project, the Clean Product Upgrade Project on the West Coast and the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in November of 2015 and the public comment period closed January 22. Once EFSEC completes its final environmental impact statement and completes an adjudicative phase, we expect EFSEC to submit its recommendation to the governor of Washington. We are very committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington and the West Coast. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on strong operating performance for 2016 and executing our annual improvements. And with that, we'll now take your questions. Operator?"

In particular, Mid-Continent, Bakken, Canadian crudes, differentials came down substantially. As we look forward to the first quarter into next year, as we said at Investor Day, we use a planning basis of transportation economics setting the differentials across the crude. So depending on your longer-term view of those, we still think that's fundamentally which offset our capture rate. And when they return to those levels, we think capture rate in the high 90s, 100% makes sense, as we said at Investor Day. But clearly, right now, the market's not pricing the crude oil differentials at transportation. So we are seeing that headwind as we saw in the fourth quarter."

But longer term -- or in the intermediate term, the debt and equity markets and MLP space are very unstable right now. A lot of volatility, very, very poor fund flows going into the space. And so as we said at Investor Day, we've really got 2 portfolios of investments in there, the organic growth projects, which were about $400 million in our plan for '16, which we feel we could fund very, very easily through our ATM program/equity from unitholders as well as a small amount of debt. The drop-downs, we continue to have in our plan 2 drop-downs for 2016.

We've talked about those in the past. So we have a portfolio of those projects. Today, we have some larger projects that we've already mentioned. And then we always have a number of small ones that we kind of balance the amount of cash that we want to return in the business, but we're very disciplined about putting a certain amount of cash back into the business that helps drive fundamental improvement over time so that we get that value from there. And then secondly, to be able to go in and maintain a very competitive dividend and then use the free cash flow to be able to then purchase stock back in that.

So let me provide some clarity around how we're thinking about that. One, we truly, truly believe that there is incredible value in our integrated business model because of where we operate as a company. So that's very important. Two, marketing is a critical part of how we're able to drive high utilization in our refineries and that connection there. So then you look at our portfolio of marketing channels, then you can call them whether they be company owned and operated or a wholesale or a dealer channel in that. So that's kind of always been -- our push has been to be able to grow that integration in marketing. So that's very important. Then the second thing is over time, we optimize that channel mix and part of that has been like take what was company operated and go to this multisite operator, which basically allows someone else just to operate the stations but the financial drivers in that aren't significantly different as if we would have operated them ourselves. I think that's an important point. And then being able to go out and strengthen our portfolio of marketing channels by, one, the acquisition of the ARCO brand was a significant enhancement to our marketing portfolio, so it gives us that dealer channel in there. We did acquire some ARCO stations last year that fits in with our portfolio, but that's an important part of it. Our company owned but multisite operator model is a part of that, and then growing the wholesale channel is a part of that. So I don't think that we're continuing to strengthen the portfolio. And our plan that we laid out going forward is that by each region, we want to be at least fully integrated with refining, and in some regions, more integrated in being net buyers in the market and have a very good portfolio, which would be different by regions, that allows the portfolio around each region to be driven by both return on invested capital on the profitability of the channel and then on the kind of the readability as it impacts refining. So long-winded answer to your question, but that's how we look at it."

I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial performance, then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter and full year results. 2015 was a record for EBITDA and earnings for Tesoro. This performance demonstrates the value of our highly integrated business model and successful execution of our annual improvement plans. Fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $54 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $172 million or $1.34 per diluted share last year. Reported results for the quarter include an inventory charge due to a lower cost to market valuation adjustment of $167 million after-tax or $1.38 per diluted share. This adjustment is a result of the decline in crude oil and product prices relative to our LIFO carrying values. 
Excluding this item, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $221 million or $1.83 per diluted share. Reported results in the quarter include the following 3 items: $30 million or $0.15 a share from the impact of additional RIN cost accruals following the recently announced EPA requirements under the renewable fuel standard program; $24 million or $0.07 a share representing an increase in the expected remediation costs associated with the 2013 crude oil pipeline release at Tioga, North Dakota; and $15 million or $0.07 per diluted share of asset impairments due to the current crude oil price environment. Total corporate and unallocated costs for the fourth quarter were $97 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 million. The increase was primarily due to higher-than-expected accruals for some corporate expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $665 million, an increase of 29% from $517 million a year ago. For the full year 2015, net income -- net earnings from continuing operations was $1.5 billion or $12.39 per diluted share versus $872 million or $6.67 per share a year ago. Excluding special items, net earnings for 2015 was $1.7 billion or $13.91 per diluted share compared to $911 million or $6.97 per diluted share for 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $3.9 billion, up 71% from $2.3 billion a year ago. 
Turning to our business segment results. Refining adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $414 million, an increase of 119% from $189 million a year ago. Total refinery throughput for the fourth quarter was 807,000 barrels a day or 95% utilization. The Tesoro Index for the fourth quarter was $15.60 per barrel with a realized gross refining margin of $12.76 per barrel or 82% of the Tesoro Index. This quarter's capture rate was primarily impacted by narrowing crude oil differentials. For instance, Bakken differentials in the quarter narrowed over $2 relative to WTI and almost $6 relative to ANS. Manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter increased $0.08 per barrel over last year to $5.62 due to unclaimed repairs and maintenance during the quarter. 
For full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for refining was $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 68%. Total refinery throughput for 2015 was 787,000 barrels a day or 93% utilization. The realized gross refining margin for 2015 was $16.22 a barrel or a capture of 84% of the Tesoro Index. 2015 capture rates were impacted by the labor disruptions in the first quarter, narrowed crude oil differentials, refinery downtime, inventory impacts related to falling crude oil prices and running more intermediate feedstock in refineries during turnarounds and maintenance. 
Moving to logistics. This segment's adjusted EBITDA was $155 million in the fourth quarter compared to $94 million a year ago. These results include a charge of approximately $24 million for expected future remediation costs for the 2013 Tioga, North Dakota crude oil pipeline release. The substantial year-over-year increase in EBITDA was primarily driven by contributions from our Rockies natural gas business, which delivered $285 million of EBITDA in 2015, and increased volumes through all TLLP's business segments. Total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $42 million during the fourth quarter and $148 million for the year. This is an increase of $61 million or 70% versus full year 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $636 million, up from $318 million last year.
For our marketing segment, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $187 million compared to $273 million last year. The decline is largely attributed to lower marketing margins. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was a record $945 million, a year-over-year increase of 59% and was driven by strong growth in consumer demand that led to higher fuel volumes. Marketing integration increased to 94% for the year versus 86% a year ago. As a result of strong operational performance, annual improvements and favorable market conditions, Tesoro generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2015. 
Turning to uses of this free cash flow for 2015. We invested $550 million in high-return capital projects, repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares for $644 million, paid dividends of $228 million and repaid $398 million of secured debt at Tesoro. We remain committed to delivering strong free cash flow and allocating capital to create long-term value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, you could find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing costs and other elements related to our first quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We achieved record EBITDA in all business segments, supported by strong consumer demand, favorable market conditions and our annual improvement program. In 2015, the Tesoro Index was $19.31 per barrel as a result of some of the unplanned operating issues in the industry on the West Coast. For 2016, we expect a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, which is an improvement of $1.50 to $2 per barrel versus 2014. The lower crude oil price environment is supportive to product demand. For 2015, U.S. clean product demand was up approximately 2% year-over-year, and PADD V clean product demand was up 2.5%. Vehicle miles traveled in PADD V has continued to outpace the U.S. average. In November, California miles traveled had a robust year-over-year growth rate of 6.7% compared to the U.S. growth rate of 3.4%. 
Turning to our operations for the fourth quarter. Overall, we had a challenging December in our refining segment due to some unplanned downtime. In our West Coast region, the Los Angeles refinery experienced problems with both of the fluid catalytic crackers and this impacted our clean product yield. Our operations in the Mid-Con and the Pacific Northwest had high utilization in the quarter. However, capture rates were impacted primarily by narrowing crude oil differentials. We were able to optimize our operations and achieved 90% -- 95% utilization, which was in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we completed the projects to install flare gas recovery systems at our Salt Lake City, Mandan and Anacortes refineries. The $217 million in combined projects were delivered under budget and on time, and these recovery systems allow us to reduce the amount of emissions and potential of flaring events at these refineries. 
Moving to our logistics segment. During 2015, we continued to execute our strategy to grow TLLP's integrated full-service logistics business. Volumes in all of our business segments continued to grow in the face of a challenging and difficult commodity price environment. During 2015, our crude oil gathering volumes were up 37% year-over-year; natural gas gathering volumes increased approximately 5% year-over-year; fee-based processing and NGL processing throughput increased approximately 8% and 20%, respectively; and terminaling volumes were up 4%; transportation pipeline volumes were up 3% year-over-year. We are very pleased with the performance of our Rockies natural gas business in 2015. For the full year, the Rockies natural gas business contributed $285 million of adjusted EBITDA, exceeding its target of $275 million. 
Based on the combined value of the acquisition of the Rockies natural gas business for $2.5 billion and the approximately $400 million value for the QEPM merger, TLLP realized an implied multiple of approximately 10x EBITDA in our first full calendar year of ownership. This was basically 1 year ahead of our original goal. Because of the successful integration, we were able to capture approximately $30 million of synergies in the full year 2015, exceeding our $25 million target. TLLP also announced several new organic growth projects that should position TLLP for future growth. Additionally, TLLP continued to grow our portfolio of logistics assets through the acquisition of a Los Angeles storage and pipeline asset acquisition from Tesoro in November of 2015. We remain committed to growing a full-service logistics business to our focus on 4 things: growing and optimizing our stable fee-based business; expanding our backlog of high-return organic growth projects; pursuing strategic third-party acquisitions; and finally, providing future drop-down opportunities. 
Now turning to marketing. This segment contributed significantly to our performance for 2015. EBITDA was a record $945 million, and the fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. In the fourth quarter, we improved our integration to 94% from 86% a year ago, increased same-store sales by about 1% and signed a strategic supply agreement with a key customer to sell fuel at 55 high-volume retail stations in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada area.
Shifting to our annual improvements. We successfully executed our plans and estimate improvements of approximately $670 million versus our $550 million to $670 million goal. We delivered approximately $350 million in West Coast improvements in capturing margin improvements. These include pipeline connections between the Los Angeles refinery; new cargo sharing between our California refineries; the completion of a second phase expansion of the waxy crude project at our Salt Lake City refinery; improved crude blending processing at our Mandan refinery; and operating expense reductions. We also delivered approximately $320 million of logistics growth in 2015 against our target of $325 million to $375 million. Tesoro expects to deliver between $400 million and $500 million of annual improvements in 2016 through refining improvements of $200 million to $250 million from better flexibility and yields, optimization and cost management; logistics improvements of $175 million to $200 million through acquisitions and organic growth projects; and marketing improvements of $25 million to $50 million through small acquisitions and organic growth. 
Additionally, we are making strategic investments that should add long-term value and are currently progressing well in the permitting process. These include the Los Angeles integration and compliance project, the Clean Product Upgrade Project on the West Coast and the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in November of 2015 and the public comment period closed January 22. Once EFSEC completes its final environmental impact statement and completes the adjudicating phase, we expect EFSEC to submit its recommendation to the governor of Washington. We are very committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington and the West Coast. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on strong operating performance for 2016 and executing our annual improvements. And with that, we'll now take your questions. Operator?"

You look at Q3 and we had a capture rate of about 90%. And in Q4, as we reported today, we came in about 82% and that's really driven primarily by what's happened with differentials. In particular, Mid-Continent, Bakken, Canadian crudes, differentials came down substantially. So as we look forward to the first quarter into next year, as we said at Investor Day, we use a planning basis of transportation economics setting the differentials across the crude. So depending on your longer-term view of those, we still think that that's fundamentally which offset our capture rate. And when they return to those levels, we think capture rate in the high 90s, 100% makes sense, as we said at Investor Day. But clearly, right now, the market's not pricing the crude oil differentials at transportation. So we are seeing that headwind as we saw in the fourth quarter."

So in terms of that part of the balance sheet, we feel very good about having the capacity to manage short-term liquidity needs. But longer term -- or in the intermediate term, the debt and equity markets and MLP space are very unstable right now. Lot of volatility, very, very poor fund flows going into the space. And so as we said at Investor Day, we've really got 2 portfolios of investments in there, the organic growth projects, which were about $400 million in our plan for '16, which we feel we could fund very, very easily through our ATM program, so that's equity from unitholders as well as a small amount of debt. The drop-downs, we continue to have in our plan 2 drop-downs for 2016. That's what we talked about at Investor Day, the Great Northern acquisition that we just completed as well as the Alaska assets, once we complete closure of that transaction.

The -- as Steven talked about, the crude diffs, particularly the Bakken diffs, now that they've been under a lot of pressure in that, we are starting to see lowering of the supply chain costs to get the crude over there. It's starting to happen and in different parts of the supply chain. And we believe that over time here in the next short period of time, we'll be able to make that cost very competitive, especially with, for example, the pipeline cost to get to the Gulf Coast of the United States, and we still get the yield advantage that we've talked about for some time relative to like, say, running ANS on the West Coast."

So let me provide some clarity around how we're thinking about that. One, we truly, truly believe that there is incredible value in our integrated business model because of where we operate as a company. So that's very important. Two, marketing is a critical part of how we're able to drive high utilization in our refineries and that connection there. So then you look at our portfolio of marketing channels, then you can call them whether they be company owned and operated or a wholesale or a dealer channel in that. So that's kind of always been -- our push has been to be able to grow that integration in marketing. So that's very important. Then the second thing is over time, we optimize that channel mix and part of that has been like take what was company operated and go to this multisite operator, which basically allows someone else just to operate the stations but the financial drivers in that aren't significantly different as if we would have operated them ourselves. I think that's an important point. And then being able to go out and strengthen our portfolio of marketing channels by, one, the acquisition of the ARCO brand was a significant enhancement to our marketing portfolio, so it gives us that dealer channel in there. We did acquire some ARCO stations last year that fits in with our portfolio, but that's an important part of it. Our company owned but multisite operator model is a part of that, and then growing the wholesale channel is a part of that. So I don't think that -- we're continuing to strengthen the portfolio. And our plan that we laid out going forward is that by each region, we want to be at least fully integrated with refining, and in some regions, more integrated in being net buyers in the market and have a very good portfolio, which would be different by regions, that allows the portfolio around each region to be driven by both return on invested capital on the profitability of the channel and then on the kind of the readability as it impacts refining. So long-winded answer to your question, but that's how we look at it."

Greg, and second question, maybe a little bit more strategic and longer term. You guys have done phenomenally over the last several years. And with the increasing concern from the market on the macro outlook, not so much as in the U.S. but also in the overseas weaknesses in the economy and all that, does it make sense at this point, given the still very strong cash flow, to allocate part of your free cash flow, maybe 20% or so, to put it into your balance sheet to further strengthen your already strong balance sheet? I mean, for 2 for 1 as the acting insurance policy in case if the uncertainty turned out to be real.

So the answer is that we look at that all of the time and are very focused on how we spend the money of the company. And I mean, we've worked hard actually, like you said, to create the balance sheet that we have today. I mean, we've worked really hard to get debt to a pretty low level. We typically -- on a Tesoro on a nonconsolidated basis, at the end of the year, we were kind of almost debt-free when you look at our cash of $1 billion and debt of $1.2 billion. And then Tesoro Logistics, we believe, can stand on its own and has -- because of a good customer base and all that, we'll be able to meet all of its requirements.

I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $0.",908,"Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $145 million of $1.15 per diluted share a year ago. 
Reported results for the quarter included a pretax inventory charge due to lower cost to market valuation adjustments of $147 million. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 included a pretax benefit of $42 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Additionally, in this quarter, we recognized a pretax benefit of $6 million for a legal settlement in the logistics business. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 were $144 million or $1.19 per diluted share and $124 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased to $541 million  from $489 million in the same quarter last year. These results demonstrate the value of our highly integrated business model with solid results in our marketing business, growth in logistics and improved refining utilization as well as other operational and cost improvements.
Today's improvements were partially offset by lower crack spreads and [indiscernible] crude oil differentials. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%, primarily due to a benefit of $13 million or $0.11 per share from a change in tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation as well as the continued growth of TLLP's income in proportionate to Tesoro's income. 
Turning to our business segments. Adjusted EBITDA for Refining was $196 million for the first quarter 2016 compared to $256 million a year ago. This decrease primary reflected lower Refining crack spreads and much narrower crude oil differentials. 
The Tesoro Index was $12.15 per barrel in the first quarter with a realized gross refining margin of $9.66 a barrel or 80% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $11.62 per barrel or 70% of the Tesoro Index last year. 
The Tesoro Index for California average $13.59 in the quarter, a decline of $4.45 from $18.04 a year ago. Additionally, Bakken differentials in the quarter narrowed over $4 a barrel relative to WTI and over $7 a barrel relative to ANS. Total throughput for the quarter was in line with expectations at 782,000 barrels a day or 89% utilization. 
Manufacturing costs in the first quarter decreased $0.78 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.55. This year-over-year [Audio Gap] the higher throughput basis in '16 compared to '15 attributable to the work stoppage in the first quarter last year.
Moving to logistics. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $174 million in the first quarter from $168 million a year ago, benefiting from growth in the gathering of processing segments as well as the acquisition by Tesoro Logistics of the Los Angeles Refinery Storage and Handing Assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
The total general partner and limited partner distribution received by Tesoro were $50 million during the first quarter. This is an increase of $15 million or 43% versus 2015.
In our marketing business, EBITDA for the first quarter was $239 million, an increase of 65% from a year ago. Results benefited from continued high consumer demand in our regions and growth in our branded station network. In fact, we have 178 more stations in our network than we had last year at this time. Also, marketing integration increased to 96% at the end of the quarter from 94% at the end of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Tesoro generated $184 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter. As far as uses of cash, we invested $96 million in income and growth projects at Tesoro and TLLP, paid quarterly dividends of $60 million, distributed $48 million to noncontrolling interests and additionally, we closed on the acquisition of Great Northern during the quarter. As a result, cash at the end of the quarter was $439 million.  
We do not repurchase shares in the quarter largely due to the funding of the acquisition. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our business with strong financial discipline which includes investing in high return capital projects and growing returns on invested capital, strengthening the balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to make strategic investments and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Tesoro has $1.4 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. In addition, our board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 2.6%. 
We've revised our expectations for 2016 capital expenditures and reduced our spending outlook by $500 million to approximately $1 billion. For Tesoro, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $300 million. This is primarily due to permit timing changes for the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project in the Clean Product Upgrade Project. 
For TLLP, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $200 billion primarily in growth capital. Several projects in the Rockies and the Bakken have been delayed beyond 2016 due to current low commodity price environment. Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook and our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."
307816,330267712,974226,"Tesoro Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Andeavor","Executives","Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Our results were driven by a strong",1018,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Our results were driven by a strong performance in our marketing and logistics businesses and demonstrate our ability to leverage our highly integrated business model.
For the quarter, Los Angeles crack spread averaged $16.32 per barrel but declined significantly in February to below $2 per barrel due to inventory builds particularly of winter-grade gasoline. 
Reflecting this trend, the Tesoro Index began the quarter at over $21 per barrel then declined to below $4 per barrel in February. The index then recovered to $15 per barrel by the end of March due to the shift towards summer-grade gasoline and continued growth in demand. 
While crude oil differentials remain narrow, we have seen an improvement in market fundamentals. For instance, [indiscernible] gasoline demand remains strong at 1.6 million barrels per day. U.S. gasoline demand was up 3.4% in the first quarter of 2016 and following a 3.5% growth rate in 2015, U.S. vehicle miles traveled grew 5.6% for February, representing the largest increase since March of 2004. 
Additionally, sales of larger [indiscernible] vehicles in the U.S. have continued to grow and this has lead to increase demand for gasoline. 
Turning into Refining operations. In California, utilization was 85% and the capture rate was also 85% in the quarter, which was impacted by crude oil differentials and refining downtime. 
In Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent, capture rates were impacted by primarily a lower margin environment, narrower crude oil differentials and weak diesel margins, particularly in the Mid-Continent. 
For the second quarter, we expect overall utilization and refining to be between 91% and 96% primarily due to the planned maintenance at our Kenai Alaska refinery. 
Moving to logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered record EBITDA and strong distributable cash flow in the quarter despite the continued challenging commodity price environment. 
TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by contributions from the Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets acquisition completed in November of 2015, continued volume growth in our crude oil gathering business and strong natural gas gathering and natural gas liquids processing volumes. Tesoro expects to offer TLLP an opportunity to acquire assets from the recently announced Alaska logistics and wholesale marketing distribution acquisition and from the recently closed acquisition of Great Northern Midstream. 
This drop-downs could add an additional $70 million to $100 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its long-term goal of $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017 to organic growth, strategic opportunities and drop-down from Tesoro. 
Shifting to our marketing business. Earnings were solid in the quarter, demonstrating the value of our integrated system to our overall performance. EBITDA was $239 million and fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. 
Our performance continues to be driven by strong consumer demand and growth in our branded network of retail stations. We are excited about the growth process in this segment as we continue to focus on business improvement initiatives and organic growth opportunities that include investing in our brands, implementing store improvements, adding new retail locations and increasing our focus on our branded retail network. 
I would like to give you an update on our expectations for 2016. At our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out the company's expectations for 2016 through 2018, which were based on the following: 1, a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; 2, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and 3, crude oil differentials that reflect transportation costs. 
For 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of improvements, including growth in the logistics business and an additional $500 million to $600 million of year-over-year improvements, primarily from higher utilization and operational efficiencies. 
Through the end of the first quarter, the Tesoro Index Refining throughput operational improvements and logistics growth are all in line with our expectations for 2016. Margins in marketing are at the high end as fuel volumes continue to grow, however, crude oil differentials are significantly narrower versus our expectations and this has resulted in lower capture rates and refining profitability. 
For instance, in the quarter, Bakken differentials narrowed over $4 per barrel relative to WTI and over $7 per barrel relative to ANS. 
Now turning to strategic acquisitions and project update. We closed the acquisition of Great Northern Midstream in January and expect to offer to TLLP for acquisition in the second half of this year. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC closed the public comment period in January. EFSEC is set to begin its adjudicative phase with hearings to be held from June 27, 2016, to July 29, 2016. We expect the final environmental impact statement to be issued this fall followed by a recommendation to the Governor of Washington. 
We are very committed to the proposed 360,000-barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington and the entire West Coast. 
On the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project, we are continuing with the permitting process, and we are now in the public comment period. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of the year and will begin construction thereafter. 
We continue to be excited about this project as it enhances our position on the West Coast and offer several benefits, including the full physical integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of between 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to drive improvements in the business and deliver on the plan we presented in December of 2015. We look forward to updating you as we progress.

But those opportunities, they absolutely need to meet our criteria to be accretive to the growth of the company. So not only do they need to be strategic fit as we described in the past but they also -- we need to be able to create value or we just want to pursue those opportunities. So we do not see a lot of opportunities that are available either through an auction process that are out there right now. And so we continue to look at opportunities -- look at the things that we've seen good for our business, evaluate it and see if there are ways to make them, those opportunities be accretive to our growth proposition right now.

But based upon that range of margins and what we're doing in the business, we are very comfortable that the sustainability is very sound but more importantly, that we can build upon that by the improvements that were driving in the business. For example, Steven cited some pretty successful growth that we have in our branded retail network on a year-over-year basis. We're working on the images of our stations and see good increases on same-store sales. We're working on the inside sales of the stations. So I think the bottom line is that if you look at the bridge of margins that we see from our network and in the part of the country where we do business and you build upon that, the steps that we're actively taking to enhance that, we feel very, very confident about the business performance today and what it holds for the future."

You have to go back to last summer, the summer 2015 when we developed our plans for 2016 and beyond. And an important part of those are our capital plans and at the time we were putting our plans together, we kind of make our best assessment of the permitting process. And we kind of assume that we arrive at a about P 50 [ph] estimate on when we expect to receive the permits with the naturally we would then commence construction. And as you know, you cited not only do we have the 3 projects from a Tesoro standpoint that we're working on, but we also have some projects from Tesoro Logistics that are relatively large for that company. So I think it's best to just talk very briefly about each project. First project is the Los Angeles integration and compliance project. So all the design, engineering, all the evaluation of that project is complete. And we are in the permitting process and it is now -- that is out for public comment. And the public comment, if they stick to the schedule, will we'll actually shortly here in the next 2 or 3 weeks. And then we'll go into the final phase before they issue the permit. When we look at that last summer, that has been extended out so we lost some valuable time, which extended that project out into '17 from when we expected to spend money in 2016. The second project is our Vancouver Energy that everyone has heard us talk about now for 3 years. That project, you can now se more light at the end of the tunnel than we had for some time. The hearings are formally set for the end of June through about 30 days, so the latter part of July. All the work that we've done, the feedback that we've received and everything looks very encouraging but it has taken considerably lower than the average also can that's kind of move that project out a little. And then finally, what we call our Clean Product Upgrade Project or most of you may be familiar with this our mixed xylene and isomerization project up in the Pacific Northwest are and part of our Anacortes refinery. Along the way, we're require to do some additional work on permitting that was unexpected last summer when we developed our plans and that's what that project out. So all 3 projects, the delays are attributable to increase time in the permitting process. We do not see anything in that permitting process that gives us any concern about being successful in the permitting process. It's just taking more time. So when you factor that into our capital plans, as Steven said, that has resulted in moving our expenditures, which were to begin in 2016 out into 2017, '18 and move it out a little bit. The impact from EBITDA standpoint, as you recall, Neil, when we presented this in December, we had very little impact EBITDA impact in our 3-year time horizon. That '16, '17, '18 period. The majority of it came on after that. I think you can recall that the total of the 3 projects added about $350 million of EBITDA but very, very little part of that was in that plan. So that will just move out by about 6 to 12 months, but the underlying value is unchanged at this point in time."

And we've clearly stated in there how -- what comprises that EBITDA, which includes drop-downs, some organic capital growth and improvements in the business in that and then when we look out to the end of 2016, for us to get to the end of 2017, we're very confident we'll hit the end of '16. But it's also important that the organic capital plays an important part of that, that we are able to see some of the projects come back online in '17 that have been moved out from '16 into '17. And that is a function of prices. They are -- it's a part of our achievement of the $1 billion. It's not a significant part of it. But if we do have flexibility to do other things because of our drop-downs, and so we'll stay focused on how we allocate capital to the growth of TLLP that creates the most value, whether it be through organic capital, potentially some small acquisitions and then the ability to drop-down. In the greater scheme for Tesoro like you stated, when we laid out our target for 2018, which was a EBITDA between $3.5 billion to $4 billion, based upon the market environment that I reiterated in my comments, we see that to be very, very achievable. The only sensitivity to that is how Steven described the crude oil differentials that -- but we see them trend towards transportation costs. Someone has to pay to move that oil to get into that refineries. I mean, it doesn't get there for no cost and so the market is that how to that, that settled because it's a fundamental view was that the cost of transportation will set the differential over time for crude to clear in the refining centers. So we're very comfortable about getting it and the timing will manage around it with the projects and organic capital."

So when we look forward and start and assume that the industry has all available capacity and is running at pretty strong utilization rates, and we factor in the demand in the marketplace, which continues to improve, which is I'll answer your question, about how we see the retail sales. But the demand continues to improve. So not only did we get the growth and demand in '14, we have growth in demand in '15. We're seeing growth and demand in '16. And so the fundamental -- our fundamental outlook is for a very favorable market environment. The demand looks very, very good. Oil Refining capacity in the PAD will be up and running and running at relatively high utilization rates that you experienced out in PADD V. And we still see a net of need to import gasoline in that environment. So will go through this transition of changes as the additional Refining comes operations come back on and you will lead us to settle very. But we our outlook is very favorable from a fundamental analysis standpoint. So if you go back and say you had $16, $17 crack, LA cracker spreads in 2014, you move forward to use a stronger demand.

I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $",916,"Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $145 million of $1.15 per diluted share a year ago. Reported results for the quarter included a pretax inventory charge due to lower of cost or market valuation adjustments of $147 million. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 included a pretax benefit of $42 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Additionally, in this quarter, we recognized a pretax benefit of $6 million for a legal settlement in the logistics business. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 were $144 million or $1.19 per diluted share and $124 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased to $541 million  from $489 million in the same quarter last year. These results demonstrate the value of our highly integrated business model, with solid results in our marketing business, growth in logistics and improved refining utilization as well as other operational and cost improvements. These improvements were partially offset by lower crack spreads and narrower crude oil differentials. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% primarily due to a benefit of $13 million or $0.11 per share from a change in tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation as well as the continued growth of TLLP's income in proportion to Tesoro's income. 
Turning to our business segments. Adjusted EBITDA for refining was $196 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $256 million a year ago. This decrease primarily reflected lower refining crack spreads and much narrower crude oil differentials. 
The Tesoro Index was $12.15 per barrel in the first quarter, with a realized gross refining margin of $9.66 a barrel or 80% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $11.62 per barrel or 70% of the Tesoro Index last year. The Tesoro Index for California averaged $13.59 in the quarter, a decline of $4.45 from $18.04 a year ago. Additionally, Bakken differentials in the quarter narrowed over $4 a barrel relative to WTI and over $7 a barrel relative to ANS.  
Total throughput for the quarter was in line with expectations at 782,000 barrels a day or 89% utilization. 
Manufacturing costs in the first quarter decreased $0.78 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.55. This year-over-year decrease was due to the higher throughput basis in '16 compared to '15 attributable to the work stoppage in the first quarter of last year.
Moving to Logistics. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $174 million in the first quarter from $168 million a year ago, benefiting from growth in the gathering and processing segments as well as the acquisition by Tesoro Logistics of the Los Angeles Refinery storage and handling assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $50 million during the first quarter. This is an increase of $15 million or 43% versus 2015.
In our marketing business, EBITDA for the first quarter was $239 million, an increase of 65% from a year ago. Results benefited from continued high consumer demand in our regions and growth on our branded station network. In fact, we have 178 more stations in our network than we had last year at this time. Also, marketing integration increased to 96% at the end of the quarter from 94% at the end of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Tesoro generated $184 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter. As far as uses of cash, we invested $96 million in income and growth projects at Tesoro and TLLP; paid quarterly dividends of $60 million; distributed $48 million to noncontrolling interests; and additionally, we closed on the acquisition of Great Northern during the quarter. As a result, cash at the end of the quarter was $439 million. 
We did not repurchase shares in the quarter largely due to the funding of the acquisition. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our business with strong financial discipline, which includes investing in high-return capital projects and growing returns on invested capital; strengthening the balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to make strategic investments; and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Tesoro has $1.4 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. In addition, our board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 2.6%. 
We've revised our expectations for 2016 capital expenditures and reduced our spending outlook by $500 million to approximately $1 billion. For Tesoro, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $300 million. This is primarily due to permit timing changes for the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project in the Clean Product Upgrade Project.  
For TLLP, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $200 billion (sic) [$200 million] primarily in growth capital. Several projects in the Rockies and the Bakken have been delayed beyond 2016 due to the current low commodity price environment. Looking ahead, you could find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."
307816,330267712,974620,"Tesoro Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Andeavor","Executives","Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Results were driven by strong perfor",1018,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Results were driven by strong performance in our marketing and Logistics businesses and demonstrate our ability to leverage our highly integrated business model.
For the quarter, Los Angeles crack spread averaged $16.32 per barrel but declined significantly in February to below $2 per barrel due to inventory builds particularly of winter-grade gasoline. Reflecting this trend, the Tesoro Index began the quarter at over $21 per barrel then declined to below $4 per barrel in February. The index then recovered to $15 per barrel by the end of March due to the shift towards summer-grade gasoline and continued growth in demand. 
While crude oil differentials remain narrow, we have seen an improvement in market fundamentals. For instance, PADD 5  gasoline demand remained strong at 1.6 million barrels per day. U.S. gasoline demand was up 3.4% in the first quarter of 2016. And following a 3.5% growth rate in 2015, U.S. vehicle miles traveled grew 5.6% for February, representing the largest increase since March of 2004. 
Additionally, sales of larger sports utility vehicles in the U.S. have continued to grow, and this has lead to increased demand for gasoline. 
Turning to Refining operations. In California, utilization was 85%, and the capture rate was also 85% in the quarter, which was impacted by crude oil differentials and refining downtime. In Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent, capture rates were impacted by primarily a lower-margin environment, narrower crude oil differentials and weak diesel margins, particularly in the Mid-Continent. For the second quarter, we expect overall utilization in Refining to be between 91% and 96%, primarily due to the planned maintenance at our Kenai Alaska refinery. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered record EBITDA and strong distributable cash flow in the quarter despite the continued challenging commodity price environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by contributions from the Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets acquisition completed in November of 2015, continued volume growth in our crude oil gathering business and strong natural gas gathering and natural gas liquids processing volumes. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP an opportunity to acquire assets from the recently announced Alaska logistics and wholesale marketing distribution acquisition and from the recently closed acquisition of Great Northern Midstream. 
This drop-down could add an additional $70 million to $100 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its long-term goal of $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017 through organic growth, strategic opportunities and drop-down from Tesoro. 
Shifting to our marketing business. Earnings were solid in the quarter, demonstrating the value of our integrated system to our overall performance. EBITDA was $239 million, and fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. Our performance continues to be driven by strong consumer demand and growth in our branded network of retail stations. We are excited about the growth prospects in this segment as we continue to focus on business improvement initiatives and organic growth opportunities that include investing in our brands, implementing store improvements, adding new retail locations and increasing our focus on our branded retail network. 
I would like to give you an update on our expectations for 2016. At our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out the company's expectations for 2016 through 2018, which were based on the following: one, a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; two, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and three, crude oil differentials that reflect transportation costs. For 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of improvements, including growth in the Logistics business and an additional $500 million to $600 million of year-over-year improvements, primarily from higher utilization and operational efficiencies. 
Through the end of the first quarter, the Tesoro Index, refining throughput, operational improvements and logistics growth are all in line with our expectations for 2016. Margins in marketing are at the high end as fuel volumes continue to grow. However, crude oil differentials are significantly narrower versus our expectations, and this has resulted in lower capture rates and refining profitability. For instance, in the quarter, Bakken differentials narrowed over $4 per barrel relative to WTI and over $7 per barrel relative to ANS. 
Now turning to strategic acquisitions and project update. We closed the acquisition of Great Northern Midstream in January and expect to offer it to TLLP for acquisition in the second half of this year. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC closed the public comment period in January. EFSEC is set to begin its adjudicative phase with hearings to be held from June 27, 2016 to July 29, 2016. We expect the final environmental impact statement to be issued this fall, followed by a recommendation to the governor of Washington. We are very committed to the proposed 360,000-barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the entire West Coast. 
On the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project, we are continuing with the permitting process, and we are now in the public comment period. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of the year and will begin construction thereafter. We continue to be excited about this project as it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full physical integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of between 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to drive improvements in the business and deliver on the plan we presented in December of 2015. We look forward to updating you as we progress.

So not only do they need to be a strategic fit, as we've described in the past, but they also -- we need to be able to create value or we just won't pursue those opportunities. So we do not see a lot of opportunities that are available, either through an auction process or out there right now. And so we continue to look at the things that we think would fit our business, evaluate it and see if there are ways to make them -- those opportunities be accretive to our growth proposition.

And as I mentioned, we'll run the high end of that range in the first 3 months of the quarter. But based upon that range of margins and what we're doing in the business, we are very comfortable that the sustainability is very sound but, more importantly, that we can then build upon that by the improvements that we're driving in the business. For example, Steven cited some pretty successful growth that we had in our branded retail network on a year-over-year basis. We're working on the images of our stations and see good increases on same-store sales. We're working on the inside sales of the stations in there. So I think the bottom line is, is that if you look at the range of margins that we see from our network in the part of the country where we do business and you build upon that the steps that we're actively taking to enhance that, we feel very, very confident about the business performance today and what it holds for the future."

You have to go back to last summer, so the summer of 2015, when we developed our plans for 2016 and beyond, and an important part of those are our capital plans. And at the time we were putting our plans together, we kind of make our best assessment of the permitting process, and we kind of assume that we arrive at about a P50 estimate of when we expect to receive the permits. We then -- naturally, we would then commence construction. And as you know, you cited, not only do we have the 3 projects from a Tesoro standpoint that we're working on, but we also have some projects from Tesoro Logistics that are relatively large for that company. So I think it's best to just talk very briefly about each project. First project is the Los Angeles integration and compliance project. So all the design, engineering, all the evaluation of that project is complete, and we are in the permitting process. And it is now -- that is out for public comment, and the public comment, if they stick to the schedule, will conclude actually shortly here within the next 2 or 3 weeks. And then they'll go into the final phase before they issue the permit. When we looked at that last summer, that has been extended out so we lost some valuable time, which extended that project out into '17 from when we expected to spend money in 2016. The second project is our Vancouver Energy that everyone has heard us talk about now for 3 years. That project, you can now see more the light at the end of the tunnel than we have for some time. The hearings are formally set for the end of June through about 30 days, so the latter part of July. All the work that we've done, the feedback that we've received and everything looks very encouraging, but it has taken considerably longer than we ever thought. So that's kind of moved that project out a little. And then finally, what we call our Clean Product Upgrade Project or what most of you may be familiar with is our mixed xylene and isomerization project up in the Pacific Northwest area in support of our Anacortes refinery. Along the way, we're required to do some additional work on permitting that was unexpected last summer when we developed our plans, and that's moved that project out. So all 3 projects, the delays are attributable to increased time in the permitting process. We do not see anything in that permitting process that gives us any concern about being successful in the permitting process. It's just taking more time. So when you factor that into our capital plans, as Steven said, that has resulted in moving our expenditures, which were to begin in 2016 out into 2017, '18 and moved it out a little bit. The impact from EBITDA standpoint, as you recall, Neil, when we presented this in December, we had very little impact -- EBITDA impact in our 3-year time horizon, that '16, '17, '18 period. The majority of it came on after that. I think you can recall that the total of the 3 projects added about $350 million of EBITDA but very, very little part of that was in that plan. So that will just move out by about 6 to 12 months, but the underlying value is unchanged at this point in time."

As we look kind of across the quarter, capture and taking into account all the moving pieces, including the hedge loss from the fourth quarter, it was probably more towards the lower end of the range. But there's other moving parts as well. Capture came in about where we expected to. So now as we move forward to the second quarter and beyond, we don't have -- we don't see any of that timing impact moving from the first quarter to the second quarter. So as we look to the second quarter, we do expect capture to be modestly higher than the first quarter, so it'll probably be in the low 80s instead right at 80. So that should give you a better indicator of -- based upon differentials, kind of where they were in the first quarter, what the earnings power is in this environment where you've got very, very narrow crude differentials."

And like Jeff's question just about the opportunities to acquire any assets for our business, we kind of scour the market for things that make sense for us, and that takes time, just like we said in December. And it's probably unlikely that anything would happen in 2016 from an acquisition standpoint. It's just -- until we find the right opportunities and go through the process of trying to capture those opportunities, it's just going to take time. So I think the bottom line answer is that what we said and what we see today is unchanged. We are in the early stages of implementing it, and we're very confident that we will be able to deliver the expectation of a pretty significant growth in the contribution of marketing by 2018."

Ideally, we do want more cash. And as we look at the market today, for these drops, the key is to execute the drops when the market is strong, the debt market. That's really -- the key issue is to build or raise capital for TLLP in the debt market when conditions have improved. But we control the timing on that, and we'll go when we're opportunistic. But at a high level, as I said, we'll expect at least 50%, and over time, as the MLP market continues to stabilize and strengthen, you could see more than that. But that's our plan right now."

And we've clearly stated in there how -- what comprises that EBITDA, which includes drop-downs, some organic capital growth and improvements in the business in that. And when we look out to the end of 2016, for us to get to the end of 2017, we're very confident we'll hit the end of '16. But it's also important that -- the organic capital plays an important part of that, that we are able to see some of the projects come back online in '17 that have been moved out from '16 into '17. And that is a function of prices. They are -- it's a part of our achievement of the $1 billion. It's not a significant part of it. But if we do have flexibility to do other things because of our drop-downs, and so we'll stay focused on how we allocate capital to the growth of TLLP that creates the most value, whether it be through organic capital, potentially some small acquisitions and then the ability to drop down. In the greater scheme for Tesoro, like you stated, when we laid out our target for 2018, which was an EBITDA between $3.5 billion to $4 billion, based upon the market environment that I reiterated in my comments, we see that to be very, very achievable. The only sensitivity to that is how Steven described the crude oil differentials, and -- but we see them trending towards transportation costs. Someone has to pay to move that oil to get it to the refineries. I mean it doesn't get there for no cost, and so the market's going to have to let that settle. Because it's our fundamental view is, is that the cost of transportation will set the differential in -- over time for crude to clear to the refining centers. So we're very comfortable about getting it and the timing. We'll manage around it with projects and organic capital."

So when we look forward and start -- and assume that the industry has all available capacity and is running at pretty strong utilization rates and we factor in the demand in the marketplace, which continues to improve, which is, I'll answer your question, about how we see the retail sales. But the demand continues to improve. So not only did we get the growth in demand in '14, we have growth in demand in '15. We're seeing growth in demand in '16. And so the fundamental -- our fundamental outlook is for a very favorable market environment. The demand looks very, very good. The oil refining capacity in the PADD will be up and running and running at relatively high utilization rates that you experienced out in PADD 5. And we still see a net need to import gasoline in that environment. So we'll go through this transition of changes as the additional refining comes -- operations come back on, and we'll -- the dust will settle there. But we -- our outlook is very favorable from a fundamental analysis standpoint. So if you go back and you say you had $16, $17 crack -- LA crack spreads in 2014, you move forward to use a stronger demand. That's kind of our view of -- you can take that for what it's worth.

I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $",917,"Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $145 million of $1.15 per diluted share a year ago. Reported results for the quarter included a pretax inventory charge due to lower of cost or market valuation adjustments of $147 million. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 included a pretax benefit of $42 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Additionally, in this quarter, we recognized a pretax benefit of $6 million for a legal settlement in the logistics business. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 were $144 million or $1.19 per diluted share and $124 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased to $541 million  from $489 million in the same quarter last year. These results demonstrate the value of our highly integrated business model, with solid results in our marketing business, growth in logistics and improved refining utilization as well as other operational and cost improvements. These improvements were partially offset by lower crack spreads and narrower crude oil differentials. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% primarily due to a benefit of $13 million or $0.11 per share from a change in tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation as well as the continued growth of TLLP's income in proportion to Tesoro's income. 
Turning to our business segments. Adjusted EBITDA for refining was $196 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $256 million a year ago. This decrease primarily reflected lower refining crack spreads and much narrower crude oil differentials. 
The Tesoro Index was $12.15 per barrel in the first quarter, with a realized gross refining margin of $9.66 a barrel or 80% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $11.62 per barrel or 70% of the Tesoro Index last year. The Tesoro Index for California averaged $13.59 in the quarter, a decline of $4.45 from $18.04 a year ago. Additionally, Bakken differentials in the quarter narrowed over $4 a barrel relative to WTI and over $7 a barrel relative to ANS.  
Total throughput for the quarter was in line with expectations at 782,000 barrels a day or 89% utilization. 
Manufacturing costs in the first quarter decreased $0.78 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.55. This year-over-year [Audio Gap]decrease was due to the higher throughput basis in '16 compared to '15 attributable to the work stoppage in the first quarter of last year.
Moving to Logistics. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $174 million in the first quarter from $168 million a year ago, benefiting from growth in the gathering and processing segments as well as the acquisition by Tesoro Logistics of the Los Angeles Refinery storage and handling assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $50 million during the first quarter. This is an increase of $15 million or 43% versus 2015.
In our marketing business, EBITDA for the first quarter was $239 million, an increase of 65% from a year ago. Results benefited from continued high consumer demand in our regions and growth on our branded station network. In fact, we have 178 more stations in our network than we had last year at this time. Also, marketing integration increased to 96% at the end of the quarter from 94% at the end of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Tesoro generated $184 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter. As far as uses of cash, we invested $96 million in income and growth projects at Tesoro and TLLP; paid quarterly dividends of $60 million; distributed $48 million to noncontrolling interests; and additionally, we closed on the acquisition of Great Northern during the quarter. As a result, cash at the end of the quarter was $439 million. 
We did not repurchase shares in the quarter largely due to the funding of the acquisition. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our business with strong financial discipline, which includes investing in high-return capital projects and growing returns on invested capital; strengthening the balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to make strategic investments; and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Tesoro has $1.4 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. In addition, our board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 2.6%. 
We've revised our expectations for 2016 capital expenditures and reduced our spending outlook by $500 million to approximately $1 billion. For Tesoro, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $300 million. This is primarily due to permit timing changes for the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project in the Clean Product Upgrade Project.  
For TLLP, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $200 billion (sic) [$200 million] primarily in growth capital. Several projects in the Rockies and the Bakken have been delayed beyond 2016 due to the current low commodity price environment. Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."
307816,330267712,974842,"Tesoro Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Andeavor","Executives","Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Our results were driven by strong pe",1019,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Our results were driven by strong performance in our marketing and Logistics businesses and demonstrate our ability to leverage our highly integrated business model.
For the quarter, Los Angeles crack spread averaged $16.32 per barrel but declined significantly in February to below $2 per barrel due to inventory builds particularly of winter-grade gasoline. Reflecting this trend, the Tesoro Index began the quarter at over $21 per barrel then declined to below $4 per barrel in February. The index then recovered to $15 per barrel by the end of March due to the shift towards summer-grade gasoline and continued growth in demand. 
While crude oil differentials remain narrow, we have seen an improvement in market fundamentals. For instance, PADD 5  gasoline demand remained strong at 1.6 million barrels per day. U.S. gasoline demand was up 3.4% in the first quarter of 2016. And following a 3.5% growth rate in 2015, U.S. vehicle miles traveled grew 5.6% for February, representing the largest increase since March of 2004. 
Additionally, sales of larger sports utility vehicles in the U.S. have continued to grow, and this has lead to increased demand for gasoline. 
Turning to Refining operations. In California, utilization was 85%, and the capture rate was also 85% in the quarter, which was impacted by crude oil differentials and refining downtime. In Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent, capture rates were impacted by primarily a lower-margin environment, narrower crude oil differentials and weak diesel margins, particularly in the Mid-Continent. For the second quarter, we expect overall utilization in Refining to be between 91% and 96%, primarily due to the planned maintenance at our Kenai Alaska refinery. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered record EBITDA and strong distributable cash flow in the quarter despite the continued challenging commodity price environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by contributions from the Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets acquisition completed in November of 2015, continued volume growth in our crude oil gathering business and strong natural gas gathering and natural gas liquids processing volumes. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP an opportunity to acquire assets from the recently announced Alaska logistics and wholesale marketing distribution acquisition and from the recently closed acquisition of Great Northern Midstream. 
These drop-downs could add an additional $70 million to $100 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its long-term goal of $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017 through organic growth, strategic opportunities and drop-down from Tesoro. 
Shifting to our marketing business. Earnings were solid in the quarter, demonstrating the value of our integrated system to our overall performance. EBITDA was $239 million, and fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. Our performance continues to be driven by strong consumer demand and growth in our branded network of retail stations. We are excited about the growth prospects in this segment as we continue to focus on business improvement initiatives and organic growth opportunities that include investing in our brands, implementing store improvements, adding new retail locations and increasing our focus on our branded retail network. 
I would like to give you an update on our expectations for 2016. At our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out the company's expectations for 2016 through 2018, which were based on the following: one, a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; two, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and three, crude oil differentials that reflect transportation costs. For 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of improvements, including growth in the Logistics business and an additional $500 million to $600 million of year-over-year improvements, primarily from higher utilization and operational efficiencies. 
Through the end of the first quarter, the Tesoro Index, refining throughput, operational improvements and logistics growth are all in line with our expectations for 2016. Margins in marketing are at the high end as fuel volumes continue to grow. However, crude oil differentials are significantly narrower versus our expectations, and this has resulted in lower capture rates and refining profitability. For instance, in the quarter, Bakken differentials narrowed over $4 per barrel relative to WTI and over $7 per barrel relative to ANS. 
Now turning to strategic acquisitions and project update. We closed the acquisition of Great Northern Midstream in January and expect to offer it to TLLP for acquisition in the second half of this year. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC closed the public comment period in January. EFSEC is set to begin its adjudicative phase with hearings to be held from June 27, 2016 to July 29, 2016. We expect the final environmental impact statement to be issued this fall, followed by a recommendation to the governor of Washington. We are very committed to the proposed 360,000-barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the entire West Coast. 
On the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project, we are continuing with the permitting process, and we are now in the public comment period. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of the year and will begin construction thereafter. We continue to be excited about this project as it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full physical integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of between 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to drive improvements in the business and deliver on the plan we presented in December of 2015. We look forward to updating you as we progress.

So not only do they need to be a strategic fit, as we've described in the past, but they also -- we need to be able to create value or we just won't pursue those opportunities. So we do not see a lot of opportunities that are available, either through an auction process that are out there right now. And so we continue to look at the things that we think would fit our business, evaluate it and see if there are ways to make them -- those opportunities be accretive to our growth proposition.

And as I mentioned, we're on the high end of that range in the first 3 months of the quarter. But based upon that range of margins and what we're doing in the business, we are very comfortable that the sustainability is very sound but, more importantly, that we can then build upon that by the improvements that we're driving in the business. For example, Steven cited some pretty successful growth that we had in our branded retail network on a year-over-year basis. We're working on the images of our stations and see good increases on same-store sales. We're working on the inside sales of the stations in there. So I think the bottom line is, is that if you look at the range of margins that we see for our network in the part of the country where we do business and you build upon that the steps that we're actively taking to enhance that, we feel very, very confident about the business performance today and what it holds for the future."

You have to go back to last summer, so the summer of 2015, when we developed our plans for 2016 and beyond, and an important part of those are our capital plans. And at the time we were putting our plans together, we kind of make our best assessment of the permitting process, and we kind of assume that we arrive at about a P50 estimate of when we expect to receive the permits. We then -- naturally, we would then commence construction. And as you know, you cited, not only do we have the 3 projects from a Tesoro standpoint that we're working on, but we also have some projects from Tesoro Logistics that are relatively large for that company. So I think it's best to just talk very briefly about each project. First project is the Los Angeles integration and compliance project. So all the design, engineering, all the evaluation of that project is complete, and we are in the permitting process. And it is now -- that is out for public comment, and the public comment, if they stick to the schedule, will conclude actually shortly here within the next 2 or 3 weeks. And then they'll go into the final phase before they issue the permit. When we looked at that last summer, that has been extended out so we lost some valuable time, which extended that project out into '17 from when we expected to spend money in 2016. The second project is our Vancouver Energy that everyone has heard us talk about now for 3 years. That project, you can now see more of the light at the end of the tunnel than we have for some time. The hearings are formally set for the end of June through about 30 days, so the latter part of July. All the work that we've done, the feedback that we've received and everything looks very encouraging, but it has taken considerably longer than we ever thought. So that's kind of moved that project out a little. And then finally, what we call our Clean Product Upgrade Project or what most of you may be familiar with is our mixed xylene and isomerization project up in the Pacific Northwest area in support of our Anacortes refinery. Along the way, we're required to do some additional work on permitting that was unexpected last summer when we developed our plans, and that's moved that project out. So all 3 projects, the delays are attributable to increased time in the permitting process. We do not see anything in that permitting process that gives us any concern about being successful in the permitting process. It's just taking more time. So when you factor that into our capital plans, as Steven said, that has resulted in moving our expenditures, which were to begin in 2016 out into 2017, '18 and moved it out a little bit. The impact from a EBITDA standpoint, as you recall, Neil, when we presented this in December, we had very little impact -- EBITDA impact in our 3-year time horizon, that '16, '17, '18 period. The majority of it came on after that. I think you can recall that the total of the 3 projects added about $350 million of EBITDA but very, very little part of that was in that plan.

As we look kind of across the quarter, capture and taking into account all the moving pieces, including the hedge loss from the fourth quarter, it was probably more towards the lower end of the range. But there's other moving parts as well. Capture came in about where we expected to. So now as we move forward to the second quarter and beyond, we don't have -- we don't see any of that timing impact moving from the first quarter to the second quarter. So as we look to the second quarter, we do expect capture to be modestly higher than the first quarter, so it'll probably be in the low 80s instead right at 80. So that should give you a better indicator of -- based upon differentials, kind of where they were in the first quarter, what the earnings power is in this environment where you've got very, very narrow crude differentials."

And like Jeff's question just about the opportunities to acquire any assets for our business, we kind of scour the market for things that make sense for us, and that takes time, just like we said in December. And it's probably unlikely that anything would happen in 2016 from an acquisition standpoint. It's just -- until we find the right opportunities and go through the process of trying to capture those opportunities, it's just going to take time. So I think the bottom line answer is that what we said and what we see today is unchanged. We are in the early stages of implementing it, and we're very confident that we will be able to deliver the expectation of a pretty significant growth in the contribution of marketing by 2018."

Ideally, we do want more cash. And as we look at the market today, for these drops, the key is to execute the drops when the market is strong, the debt market. That's really -- the key issue is to be able to raise capital for TLLP in the debt market when conditions have improved. But we control the timing on that, and we'll go when we're opportunistic. But at a high level, as I said, we'll expect at least 50%, and over time, as the MLP market continues to stabilize and strengthen, you could see more than that. But that's our plan right now."

And we've clearly stated in there how -- what comprises that EBITDA, which includes drop-downs, some organic capital growth and improvements in the business in that. And when we look out to the end of 2016, for us to get to the end of 2017, we're very confident we'll hit the end of '16. But it's also important that -- the organic capital plays an important part of that, that we are able to see some of the projects come back online in '17 that have been moved out from '16 into '17. And that is a function of prices. They are -- it's a part of our achievement of the $1 billion. It's not a significant part of it. But we do have flexibility to do other things because of our drop-downs, and so we'll stay focused on how we allocate capital to the growth of TLLP that creates the most value, whether it be through organic capital, potentially some small acquisitions and then the ability to drop down. In the greater scheme for Tesoro, like you stated, when we laid out our target for 2018, which was a EBITDA between $3.5 billion to $4 billion, based upon the market environment that I reiterated in my comments, we see that to be very, very achievable. The only sensitivity to that is how Steven described the crude oil differentials, and -- but we see them trending towards transportation costs. Someone has to pay to move that oil to get it to the refineries. I mean it doesn't get there for no cost, and so the market's going to have to let that settle. Because it's our fundamental view is, is that the cost of transportation will set the differential in -- over time for crude to clear to the refining centers. So we're very comfortable about getting it and the timing. We'll manage around it with projects and organic capital."

So when we look forward and start -- and assume that the industry has all available capacity and is running at pretty strong utilization rates and we factor in the demand in the marketplace, which continues to improve, which is, I'll answer your question, about how we see the retail sales. But the demand continues to improve. So not only did we get the growth in demand in '14, we have growth in demand in '15. We're seeing growth in demand in '16. And so the fundamental -- our fundamental outlook is for a very favorable market environment. The demand looks very, very good. The oil refining capacity in the PADD will be up and running and running at relatively high utilization rates that you experienced out in PADD 5. And we still see a net need to import gasoline in that environment. So we'll go through this transition of changes as the additional refining comes -- operations come back on, and we'll -- the dust will settle there. But we -- our outlook is very favorable from a fundamental analysis standpoint. So if you go back and you say you had $16, $17 crack -- LA crack spreads in 2014, you move forward to use a stronger demand. That's kind of our view of -- you can take that for what it's worth.

I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $",918,"Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our first quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported first quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $58 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $145 million of $1.15 per diluted share a year ago. Reported results for the quarter included a pretax inventory charge due to lower of cost or market valuation adjustments of $147 million. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 included a pretax benefit of $42 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Additionally, in this quarter, we recognized a pretax benefit of $6 million for a legal settlement in the logistics business. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 were $144 million or $1.19 per diluted share and $124 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased to $541 million from $489 million in the same quarter last year. These results demonstrate the value of our highly integrated business model, with solid results in our marketing business, growth in logistics and improved refining utilization as well as other operational and cost improvements. These improvements were partially offset by lower crack spreads and narrower crude oil differentials. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% primarily due to a benefit of $13 million or $0.11 per share from a change in tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation as well as the continued growth of TLLP's income in proportion to Tesoro's income. 
Turning to our business segments. Adjusted EBITDA for refining was $196 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $256 million a year ago. This decrease primarily reflected lower refining crack spreads and much narrower crude oil differentials. 
The Tesoro Index was $12.15 per barrel in the first quarter, with a realized gross refining margin of $9.66 a barrel or 80% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $11.62 per barrel or 70% of the Tesoro Index last year. The Tesoro Index for California averaged $13.59 in the quarter, a decline of $4.45 from $18.04 a year ago. Additionally, Bakken differentials in the quarter narrowed over $4 a barrel relative to WTI and over $7 a barrel relative to ANS. 
Total throughput for the quarter was in line with expectations at 782,000 barrels a day or 89% utilization. 
Manufacturing costs in the first quarter decreased $0.78 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.55. This year-over-year decrease was due to the higher throughput basis in '16 compared to '15 attributable to the work stoppage in the first quarter of last year.
Moving to Logistics. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $174 million in the first quarter from $168 million a year ago, benefiting from growth in the gathering and processing segments as well as the acquisition by Tesoro Logistics of the Los Angeles Refinery storage and handling assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $50 million during the first quarter. This is an increase of $15 million or 43% versus 2015.
In our marketing business, EBITDA for the first quarter was $239 million, an increase of 65% from a year ago. Results benefited from continued high consumer demand in our regions and growth on our branded station network. In fact, we have 178 more stations in our network than we had last year at this time. Also, marketing integration increased to 96% at the end of the quarter from 94% at the end of 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Tesoro generated $184 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter. As far as uses of cash, we invested $96 million in income and growth projects at Tesoro and TLLP; paid quarterly dividends of $60 million; distributed $48 million to noncontrolling interests; and additionally, we closed on the acquisition of Great Northern during the quarter. As a result, cash at the end of the quarter was $439 million. 
We did not repurchase shares in the quarter largely due to the funding of the acquisition. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our business with strong financial discipline, which includes investing in high-return capital projects and growing returns on invested capital; strengthening the balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to make strategic investments; and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Tesoro has $1.4 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. In addition, our board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 2.6%. 
We've revised our expectations for 2016 capital expenditures and reduced our spending outlook by $500 million to approximately $1 billion. For Tesoro, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $300 million. This is primarily due to permit timing changes for the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project in the Clean Product Upgrade Project. 
For TLLP, we're reducing capital expenditure guidance by approximately $200 billion (sic) [ $200 million ] primarily in growth capital. Several projects in the Rockies and the Bakken have been delayed beyond 2016 due to the current low commodity price environment. Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Our results were driven by strong pe",1019,"Thanks, Steven, and good morning. We were able to deliver earnings growth in the quarter despite compressed crude oil differentials and industry refining margins being low, especially in the first 2 months of the year. Our results were driven by strong performance in our marketing and Logistics businesses and demonstrate our ability to leverage our highly integrated business model.
For the quarter, Los Angeles crack spread averaged $16.32 per barrel but declined significantly in February to below $2 per barrel due to inventory builds particularly of winter-grade gasoline. Reflecting this trend, the Tesoro Index began the quarter at over $21 per barrel then declined to below $4 per barrel in February. The index then recovered to $15 per barrel by the end of March due to the shift towards summer-grade gasoline and continued growth in demand. 
While crude oil differentials remain narrow, we have seen an improvement in market fundamentals. For instance, PADD 5 gasoline demand remained strong at 1.6 million barrels per day. U.S. gasoline demand was up 3.4% in the first quarter of 2016. And following a 3.5% growth rate in 2015, U.S. vehicle miles traveled grew 5.6% for February, representing the largest increase since March of 2004. Additionally, sales of larger sports utility vehicles in the U.S. have continued to grow, and this has led to increased demand for gasoline. 
Turning to Refining operations. In California, utilization was 85%, and the capture rate was also 85% in the quarter, which was impacted by crude oil differentials and refining downtime. In Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent, capture rates were impacted by primarily a lower-margin environment, narrower crude oil differentials and weak diesel margins, particularly in the Mid-Continent. For the second quarter, we expect overall utilization in Refining to be between 91% and 96%, primarily due to the planned maintenance at our Kenai Alaska refinery. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered record EBITDA and strong distributable cash flow in the quarter despite the continued challenging commodity price environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by contributions from the Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets acquisition completed in November of 2015, continued volume growth in our crude oil gathering business and strong natural gas gathering and natural gas liquids processing volumes. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP an opportunity to acquire assets from the recently announced Alaska logistics and wholesale marketing distribution acquisition and from the recently closed acquisition of Great Northern Midstream. 
These drop-downs could add an additional $70 million to $100 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its long-term goal of $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017 through organic growth, strategic opportunities and drop-down from Tesoro. 
Shifting to our marketing business. Earnings were solid in the quarter, demonstrating the value of our integrated system to our overall performance. EBITDA was $239 million, and fuel margin was $0.14 per gallon. Our performance continues to be driven by strong consumer demand and growth in our branded network of retail stations. We are excited about the growth prospects in this segment as we continue to focus on business improvement initiatives and organic growth opportunities that include investing in our brands, implementing store improvements, adding new retail locations and increasing our focus on our branded retail network. 
I would like to give you an update on our expectations for 2016. At our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out the company's expectations for 2016 through 2018, which were based on the following: one, a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; two, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and three, crude oil differentials that reflect transportation costs. For 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of improvements, including growth in the Logistics business and an additional $500 million to $600 million of year-over-year improvements, primarily from higher utilization and operational efficiencies. 
Through the end of the first quarter, the Tesoro Index, refining throughput, operational improvements and logistics growth are all in line with our expectations for 2016. Margins in marketing are at the high end as fuel volumes continue to grow. However, crude oil differentials are significantly narrower versus our expectations, and this has resulted in lower capture rates and refining profitability. For instance, in the quarter, Bakken differentials narrowed over $4 per barrel relative to WTI and over $7 per barrel relative to ANS. 
Now turning to strategic acquisitions and project update. We closed the acquisition of Great Northern Midstream in January and expect to offer it to TLLP for acquisition in the second half of this year. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC closed the public comment period in January. EFSEC is set to begin its adjudicative phase with hearings to be held from June 27, 2016 to July 29, 2016. We expect the final environmental impact statement to be issued this fall, followed by a recommendation to the governor of Washington. We are very committed to the proposed 360,000-barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the entire West Coast. 
On the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project, we are continuing with the permitting process, and we are now in the public comment period. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of the year and will begin construction thereafter. We continue to be excited about this project as it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full physical integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of between 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions. 
Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to drive improvements in the business and deliver on the plan we presented in December of 2015. We look forward to updating you as we progress.

But those opportunities, they absolutely need to meet our criteria to be accretive to the growth of the company. So not only do they need to be a strategic fit, as we've described in the past, but they also -- we need to be able to create value or we just won't pursue those opportunities. So we do not see a lot of opportunities that are available, either through an auction process that are out there right now. And so we continue to look at the things that we think would fit our business, evaluate it and see if there are ways to make them -- those opportunities be accretive to our growth proposition.

But based upon that range of margins and what we're doing in the business, we are very comfortable that the sustainability is very sound but, more importantly, that we can then build upon that by the improvements that we're driving in the business. For example, Steven cited some pretty successful growth that we had in our branded retail network on a year-over-year basis. We're working on the images of our stations and see good increases on same-store sales. We're working on the inside sales of the stations in there. So I think the bottom line is, is that if you look at the range of margins that we see for our network in the part of the country where we do business and you build upon that the steps that we're actively taking to enhance that, we feel very, very confident about the business performance today and what it holds for the future."

You have to go back to last summer, so the summer of 2015, when we developed our plans for 2016 and beyond, and an important part of those are our capital plans. And at the time we were putting our plans together, we kind of make our best assessment of the permitting process, and we kind of assume that we arrive at about a P50 estimate of when we expect to receive the permits. We then -- naturally, we would then commence construction. And as you know, you cited, not only do we have the 3 projects from a Tesoro standpoint that we're working on, but we also have some projects from Tesoro Logistics that are relatively large for that company. So I think it's best to just talk very briefly about each project. First project is the Los Angeles integration and compliance project. So all the design, engineering, all the evaluation of that project is complete, and we are in the permitting process. And it is now -- that is out for public comment, and the public comment, if they stick to the schedule, will conclude actually shortly here within the next 2 or 3 weeks. And then they'll go into the final phase before they issue the permit. When we looked at that last summer, that has been extended out so we lost some valuable time, which extended that project out into '17 from when we expected to spend money in 2016. The second project is our Vancouver Energy that everyone has heard us talk about now for 3 years. That project, you can now see more of the light at the end of the tunnel than we have for some time. The hearings are formally set for the end of June through about 30 days, so the latter part of July. All the work that we've done, the feedback that we've received and everything looks very encouraging, but it has taken considerably longer than we ever thought. So that's kind of moved that project out a little. And then finally, what we call our Clean Product Upgrade Project or what most of you may be familiar with is our mixed xylene and isomerization project up in the Pacific Northwest area in support of our Anacortes refinery. Along the way, we're required to do some additional work on permitting that was unexpected last summer when we developed our plans, and that's moved that project out. So all 3 projects, the delays are attributable to increased time in the permitting process. We do not see anything in that permitting process that gives us any concern about being successful in the permitting process. It's just taking more time. So when you factor that into our capital plans, as Steven said, that has resulted in moving our expenditures, which were to begin in 2016 out into 2017, '18 and moved it out a little bit. The impact from a EBITDA standpoint, as you recall, Neil, when we presented this in December, we had very little impact -- EBITDA impact in our 3-year time horizon, that '16, '17, '18 period. The majority of it came on after that. I think you can recall that the total of the 3 projects added about $350 million of EBITDA but very, very little part of that was in that plan. So that will just move out by about 6 to 12 months, but the underlying value is unchanged at this point in time."

As we look kind of across the quarter, capture and taking into account all the moving pieces, including the hedge loss from the fourth quarter, it was probably more towards the lower end of the range. But there's other moving parts as well. Capture came in about where we expected to. So now as we move forward to the second quarter and beyond, we don't have -- we don't see any of that timing impact moving from the first quarter to the second quarter. So as we look to the second quarter, we do expect capture to be modestly higher than the first quarter, so it'll probably be in the low 80s instead right at 80. So that should give you a better indicator of -- based upon differentials, kind of where they were in the first quarter, what the earnings power is in this environment where you've got very, very narrow crude differentials."

And like Jeff's question just about the opportunities to acquire any assets for our business, we kind of scour the market for things that make sense for us, and that takes time, just like we said in December. And it's probably unlikely that anything would happen in 2016 from an acquisition standpoint. It's just -- until we find the right opportunities and go through the process of trying to capture those opportunities, it's just going to take time. So I think the bottom line answer is that what we said and what we see today is unchanged. We are in the early stages of implementing it, and we're very confident that we will be able to deliver the expectation of a pretty significant growth in the contribution of marketing by 2018."

Ideally, we do want more cash. And as we look at the market today, for these drops, the key is to execute the drops when the market is strong, the debt market. That's really -- the key issue is to be able to raise capital for TLLP in the debt market when conditions have improved. But we control the timing on that, and we'll go when we're opportunistic. But at a high level, as I said, we'll expect at least 50%, and over time, as the MLP market continues to stabilize and strengthen, you could see more than that. But that's our plan right now."

And we've clearly stated in there how -- what comprises that EBITDA, which includes drop-downs, some organic capital growth and improvements in the business in that. And when we look out to the end of 2016, for us to get to the end of 2017, we're very confident we'll hit the end of '16. But it's also important that -- the organic capital plays an important part of that, that we are able to see some of the projects come back online in '17 that have been moved out from '16 into '17. And that is a function of prices. They are -- it's a part of our achievement of the $1 billion. It's not a significant part of it. But we do have flexibility to do other things because of our drop-downs, and so we'll stay focused on how we allocate capital to the growth of TLLP that creates the most value, whether it be through organic capital, potentially some small acquisitions and then the ability to drop down. In the greater scheme for Tesoro, like you stated, when we laid out our target for 2018, which was a EBITDA between $3.5 billion to $4 billion, based upon the market environment that I reiterated in my comments, we see that to be very, very achievable. The only sensitivity to that is how Steven described the crude oil differentials, and -- but we see them trending towards transportation costs. Someone has to pay to move that oil to get it to the refineries. I mean it doesn't get there for no cost, and so the market's going to have to let that settle. Because it's our fundamental view is, is that the cost of transportation will set the differential in -- over time for crude to clear to the refining centers. So we're very comfortable about getting it and the timing. We'll manage around it with projects and organic capital."

So when we look forward and start -- and assume that the industry has all available capacity and is running at pretty strong utilization rates and we factor in the demand in the marketplace, which continues to improve, which is, I'll answer your question, about how we see the retail sales. But the demand continues to improve. So not only did we get the growth in demand in '14, we have growth in demand in '15. We're seeing growth in demand in '16. And so the fundamental -- our fundamental outlook is for a very favorable market environment. The demand looks very, very good. The oil refining capacity in the PADD will be up and running and running at relatively high utilization rates that you experienced out in PADD 5. And we still see a net need to import gasoline in that environment. So we'll go through this transition of changes as the additional refining comes -- operations come back on, and we'll -- the dust will settle there. But we -- our outlook is very favorable from a fundamental analysis standpoint. So if you go back and you say you had $16, $17 crack -- LA crack spreads in 2014, you move forward to use a stronger demand. That's kind of our view of -- you can take that for what it's worth.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg.

I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $418 million attributable to Tesoro or $3.47 per diluted share compared to $586 million or $4.62 a share a year ago. 
Consolidated net earnings were $449 million for the second quarter compared to $620 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA for the second quarter was $956 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. 
Reported earnings and EBITDA for the quarter included a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost of market valuation adjustment of $363 million or $220 million after-tax. 
Our second quarter 2016 results reflect continued growth in our Logistics business and strong performance in marketing, offset by lower-than-expected performance in refining. 
Turning to the business segments. Refining operating income was $520 million for the second quarter compared to $757 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $692 million versus $880 million last year. 
The Tesoro Index was $13.93 a barrel in the second quarter with a gross refining margin of $15.70 a barrel or 113% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to gross refining margin of $19.13 per barrel or 89% of the Tesoro Index last year. 
Please remember that gross refining margin in the quarter included a pretax benefit of $363 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Total refinery throughput for the quarter was at the lower end of our guidance at 802,000 barrels a day or 92% utilization. During the quarter, we had an extension of the planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery as well as unplanned unit downtime within our California region and both of these impacted our throughput and capture rates. 
Manufacturing costs in the second quarter decreased $0.57 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.01. This year-over-year decrease was due to the higher throughput in '16 compared to 2015, but also a decline in natural gas prices. 
Tesoro's integrated business model helps mitigate our exposure to RINs, however, the price of RINs increased in the second quarter and impacted us by approximately $10 million. 
Moving to Logistics. Operating income increased to $125 million in the second quarter from $104 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $172 million from $149 million last year. 
Results benefited from year-over-year volume growth in the crude oil gathering and terminalling transportation businesses as well as contributions from TLP's acquisition of the LA storage and handling assets. 
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $59 million during the second quarter. This is an increase of $26 million or 79% versus 2015. 
Turning to marketing. Operating income was $161 million compared to $212 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $173 million compared to $223 million last year. 
Our fuel margins were $0.105 a gallon in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we saw continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions. These include: Growth in consumer demand; increase in vehicle miles traveled; growth in Tesoro's fuel sale volumes of 6%; and 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network; and marketing integration increased to 98% from 93% a year ago. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our continued focus on creating value for shareholders by driving improvements in our business, then I'll discuss our financial discipline and principles of capital allocation. 
We remain committed to driving improvements in the earnings of our business each year and all cycles in the industry. In 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of operating income and EBITDA improvements through these efforts. This includes organic growth and acquisitions in our logistics business, growth in our marketing business and costs, yields and other efficiencies in refining and commercial operations. We're on track to deliver these results in 2016. 
These improvements can be seen in our relative performance over time. In fact, if you look at Tesoro's earnings CAGRs since 2014 versus that of our core peers, you'll see our overall earnings were down approximately 4% due to lower overall refining industry margins and crude differentials. However, the core peer group is down approximately 15% to 25%. We believe this reflects the impact of our continued focus on driving business improvements every year. 
Further, the same relative outperformance can be seen in our free cash flow yields. This continued focus on and execution of driving improvements results in significant shareholder value creation and that continues to be seen in our cash flows and capital allocation priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a consolidated cash balance of $1.1 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Our balance sheet remains strong, with a total debt, net of unamortized issuance costs to capitalization ratio of 36%. 
Excluding TLP debt and equity, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter. We also currently have $2.1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned to obtain the investment-grade ratings from both companies. Investment-grade credit ratings for Tesoro and TLP offer substantial benefits of both companies, including lower relative debt spreads of 100 to 200 basis points over time, potential combined interest cost savings of $80 million to $105 million and most importantly, the ability to access extended debt maturities for TLLP. 
Turning to cash flows. Tesoro generated $444 million of cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. Now I'll discuss how we deployed cash to create long-term shareholder value. 
First, we invested in high-return capital projects and grow returns on invested capital. During the quarter, we invested $105 million in income growth per capital project at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures through the first half of 2016 were approximately $400 million. We expect 2016 capital spending of approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our previously announced plan. 
Second, we continue to ensure we have a some balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and return cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent approximately $80 million on 2 highly accretive acquisitions. 
We continue to look for additional opportunities and are currently focusing on targets in midstream and other assets, which can enhance our integrated business model. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $100 million. Tesoro currently has $1.3 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. We also paid quarterly dividends of $121 million and distributed $98 million to noncontrolling interest. 
Yesterday, we announced that our board approved a 10% increase to the quarterly dividend, which is now $0.55 a share or $2.20 per share annually. Additionally, during the quarter, TLLP successfully raised approximately $1 billion of debt and equity. TLLP repaid the amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and will use the balance to fund future drops and growth investments. 
As we entered 2016, given the uncertainty MLP capital markets, Tesoro plan to support TLLP's growth and take approximately 50% of drop-down proceeds in the form of TLLP units. Given the success and the strength of TLLP's equity and debt offerings in the second quarter, Tesoro now has the flexibility to receive a greater portion of cash as consideration for future drop-downs. 
With July's last storage and terminalling assets down Martinez, Martinez storage and marine drop downs, TLLP now expects [ph] $50 million to $75 million of net net earnings or approximately $90 million to $110 million of annual EBITDA from drop-downs from Tesoro in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 10% to 30% from previous guidance. 
This increased  EBITDA range for TLLP provides Tesoro the opportunity to obtain higher than previously expected cash proceeds from drop-downs in 2016. 
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

Even with the Tesoro Index, 6% lower compared to the average of 2014 and 2015. We completed 2 acquisitions that further strengthened our portfolio and each has significant synergy opportunities and growth potential. 
Turning to refining operations. On the West Coast, we saw increased product demand in the quarter. Our refining utilization in California was 94%, throughput and capture rates were impacted by unplanned unit downtime in the region. 
In the Pacific Northwest, our performance was impacted by longer-than-planned maintenance in our Kenai, Alaska refinery and this led to lower throughput in the region. 
In the Mid-Continent, the Tesoro Index was down approximately 34% in the second quarter to $14.65. This lower margin environment, along with narrower crude oil differentials, negatively impacted year-over-year operating results. 
For the third quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 93% and 99%. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered strong operating income and segment EBITDA growth in the quarter despite the continued weak overall commodity environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by growth in our crude oil pipeline gathering, natural gas liquids processing, terminalling and pipeline transportation throughput as well as contributions from the Los Angeles Storage and Handling Asset acquisition. 
Year-to-date, TLLP has seen volume growth of approximately 23% in crude oil pipeline gathering volumes, 5% in NGL processing throughput, 4% in terminalling throughput and 4% in pipeline transportation volumes over the same period last year. 
Additionally, on July 1, Tesoro agreed to sell storage and terminalling assets in Alaska to TLLP for $444 million. These assets include crude oil, feedstock and refine product storage tanks in Kenai, Alaska and refine product terminals in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
The total acquisition price includes cash proceeds to Tesoro of $400 million and the issuance of common and general partner units to Tesoro valued at about $44 million. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and marine assets in Martinez, California in the second half of this year these. Assets could add $16 million to $36 million of annual net earnings and $40 million to $60 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. 
Also, Tesoro now expects to offer the previously announced Great Northern Midstream assets in North Dakota for sale to TLLP sometime after this year. 
Looking forward, TLLP continues to grow its business and remains on track to achieve our target of $825 million of annual operating income and $1 billion in annual segment EBITDA by year-end of next year. 
Shifting to our Marketing business. Overall performance in the quarter was good. During the second quarter, we saw a continuing positive trends in the market and in our business. 
Continued strong consumer demand with gasoline demand up 2.5% through May, an increase in vehicle miles traveled of 3.4% through the same time period, growth in Tesoro's fuel volumes of about 6%, an increase -- 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network and marketing integration, as Steven said, increased to 98% versus 93% last year. 
We remain excited about the growth prospects we see in this business. Against a backdrop of a strong economy, growth in consumer demand and favorable conditions in the markets in which we operate, we continue to expand our network of stations in focus on growth opportunities towards our goal of $916 [ph] million of operating income and $1 billion of segment EBITDA by 2018. 
Turning to strategic acquisitions and project updates. We closed the acquisition of wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska in June. The acquisition enhances our capability to efficiently and reliably serve our customers in the State of Alaska. 
In addition, as I referenced earlier, we agreed to sell the Logistics portion of this acquisition to TLLP in July. We also acquired the Dakota Prairie refinery, a 20,000 barrel a day refinery in Dickinson, North Dakota and its associated business. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC concluded the 5-week period portion of adjudicative phase on July 29 of this year. On -- Once EFSEC issue of final environmental impact statement, they will provide a recommendation to the Governor of Washington. 
We are very committed to the proposed 360,000-barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the West Coast.
Moving to the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project, we continue to make progress on the permitting process, the public comment period closed in mid-June and the South Coast Air Quality Management District is currently responding to the comments that were submitted and preparing the final environmental impact report. 
We continue to expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and plan to begin construction thereafter. 
As you know, we are excited about this project because it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day between gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and other criteria pollutant emissions. 
To provide you an update on the progress to deliver improvements in our business, at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based upon a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, Marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon, crude oil differentials that reflect the cost of transportation and year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $500 million to $600 million. 
Through the first half of the year, the Tesoro Index and Marketing fuel margins are basically in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials, however, continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year. 
Refining utilization is at the low end of our expectations, primarily due to unplanned maintenance. As a result, we now expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiency of $400 million to $500 million. 
Additionally, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million the $250 million in refining, $175 million to $200 million in logistics and $25 million to $50 million in marketing. 
As Steven said, through the first half of 2016, our estimate and Refining and Marketing improvements are on track with our full year expectations, while logistics improvements are tracking slightly below the range, which is primarily attributable to slower-than-expected organic growth due to the weak commodity price environment. 
For the full year 2016, we remain committed to delivering the $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income we laid out at our Analyst at Investor Day. 
Let me conclude by saying that we are committed to creating shareholder value by continuing to optimize our assets across the value chain, driving improvements in the business and growing and transforming our portfolio of refining, logistics and marketing assets.

But as we guided into that business more and we looked at how we wanted to commercializes those assets, we always recognize when we made the acquisition that we wanted to make some changes that would provide the service and the cost effectiveness to the producers and that's just taking us a little bit longer than we anticipated.

However, today, we find ourselves in a period of time where the markets are a lot weaker, and you probably hit the nail on the head with the 2 points that you made, you have -- we did experience in of the higher levels of imports during the transition of ownership and an refinery in California and that change in ownership is kind the working its way through the system.

So we see a very good outlook for the supply to the customers in the third quarter. The -- your second question about the -- how our shares show up in the marketplace, I think, just probably 3 or 4 key comments. One is, as you know and everyone else knows, we are absolutely committed to continued to drive improvements in their business, which we've demonstrated to be very good at being able to deliver those improvements. And as both Steven and I stated, we're on track to accomplish what we laid out for this year and we'll lay out our plans for next year at the end of this year. So I think that's important. In the -- from a refining standpoint, we are absolutely committed to driving a very strong operating excellence management system, which translates into high reliability in our refining operations. The second quarter was not good for us. We experienced some unplanned maintenance that we didn't expect to have and we've dealt with that. It's all been taken care off and we are running extremely well right now. So that was about a little bit disappointing but it's that focus on driving that continued operating excellence and in our operations. We want to be able to continue to grow both the Logistics business, and we're encouraged about to what we see out there and the things we're working on as well as the Marketing business. We're in the early stages of our plans that we talked about last year on Marketing. We -- Steven mentioned that the number of our station count is up about 8% year-on-year, which is strong growth primarily in what people refer to as the wholesale or the jumper channel, and we continue to drive fundamental improvement in the marketing business. So we're going to stay absolutely focus on those commitments that we've made to drive improvements in the business, and we believe that the market will see the impact of that as we move forward over time."

And once we got actually into the business, which I'll remind you is only been about 30 days, we've actually seen more opportunities which is always encouraging. And so for being able to operate in our system, it will fit in very, very well to the Tesoro total integrated value chain. The other 2 points are that 1, we will continue to supply ultra-low sulfur diesel to the business market that the Dickinson refinery operates in. And more encouragingly, the naphtha and resid that comes of the refinery will fit extremely well into other refineries in Tesoro, which will be able to upgrade by running it through primarily our cat crackers. So that will provide an added benefit versus what was done with the particularly the NAFTA in the past. And then the third thing is that we are in the early stages. We see other opportunities with refineries. So the way that the refinery is constructed provides the potential opportunity to produce renewable diesel and that is something that we're in the early stages of evaluating, and we would expect to have that work done by the latter part of this year and that's important because when you look at the total system and particularly in the State of California and our need for renewable diesel, the value of producing it versus purchasing it is very, very attractive. And so we're reasonably optimistic we'll be able to make that happen going forward here. So that's the value of the Dickinson refinery to Tesoro."

That is unchanged from what we said then. So what have we done? Well 1, what we talked about earlier is we sold part of what was -- part of the EBITDA kind of let's call it the legacy Tesoro assets, which was the Alaska assets around the [ph] refinery. But in addition, from the other Botha, the other properties we are dropping down the acquisition that we did from Flint Hills Resources and that gives you the EBITDA number that came with that. And then the other only change is instead of taking the EBITDA that would have come from opportunities, which is the Great Northern anthropic down in the second half of this year, as I mentioned, we'll move that out of '16 and bring forward what we plan to do with Martinez that I think in the press release gave an EBITDA number of -- I don't remember what the number is. What is it? Up to around -- up to about $50 million. So that you can just see how that affects the 2 buckets of opportunities that we talked about. So not a big change."

So the -- there's a number of things that we're looking at that we're encouraged by. So both the combination of the organic growth and the acquisitions look very encouraging to us."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $418 m",1354,"Thank you, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $418 million attributable to Tesoro or $3.47 per diluted share compared to $586 million or $4.62 a share a year ago. 
Consolidated net earnings were $449 million for the second quarter compared to $620 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA for the second quarter was $956 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. 
Reported earnings and EBITDA for the quarter included a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost of market valuation adjustment of $363 million or $220 million after-tax. 
Our second quarter 2016 results reflect continued growth in our Logistics business and strong performance in marketing, offset by lower-than-expected performance in refining. 
Turning to the business segments. Refining operating income was $520 million for the second quarter compared to $757 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $692 million versus $880 million last year. 
The Tesoro Index was $13.93 a barrel in the second quarter with a gross refining margin of $15.70 a barrel or 113% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to gross refining margin of $19.13 per barrel or 89% of the Tesoro Index last year. 
Please remember that gross refining margin in the quarter included a pretax benefit of $363 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Total refining throughput for the quarter was at the lower end of our guidance at 802,000 barrels a day or 92% utilization. During the quarter, we had an extension of the planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery as well as unplanned unit downtime within our California region and both of these impacted our throughput and capture rates. 
Manufacturing costs in the second quarter decreased $0.57 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.01. This year-over-year decrease was due to the higher throughput in '16 compared to 2015, but also a decline in natural gas prices. 
Tesoro's integrated business model helps mitigate our exposure to RINs, however, the price of RINs increased in the second quarter and impacted us by approximately $10 million. 
Moving to Logistics. Operating income increased to $125 million in the second quarter from $104 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $172 million from $149 million last year. 
Results benefited from year-over-year volume growth in the crude oil gathering and terminalling transportation businesses as well as contributions from TLP's acquisition of the LA storage and handling assets. 
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $59 million during the second quarter. This is an increase of $26 million or 79% versus 2015. 
Turning to marketing. Operating income was $161 million compared to $212 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $173 million compared to $223 million last year. 
Our fuel margins were $0.105 a gallon in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we saw continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions. These include: Growth in consumer demand; increase in vehicle miles traveled; growth in Tesoro's fuel sale volumes of 6%; and 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network; and marketing integration increased to 98% from 93% a year ago. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our continued focus on creating value for shareholders by driving improvements in our business, then I'll discuss our financial discipline and principles of capital allocation. 
We remain committed to driving improvements in the earnings of our business each year and in all cycles of the industry. In 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of operating income and EBITDA improvements through these efforts. This includes organic growth and acquisitions in our logistics business, growth in our marketing business and costs, yields and other efficiencies in refining and commercial operations. We're on track to deliver these results in 2016. 
These improvements can be seen in our relative performance over time. In fact, if you look at Tesoro's earnings CAGR since 2014 versus that of our core peers, you'll see our overall earnings were down approximately 4% due to lower overall refining industry margins and crude differentials. However, the core peer group is down approximately 15% to 25%. We believe this reflects the impact of our continued focus on driving business improvements every year. 
Further, the same relative outperformance can be seen in our free cash flow yields. This continued focus on and execution of driving improvements results in significant shareholder value creation and that continues to be seen in our cash flows and capital allocation priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a consolidated cash balance of $1.1 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Our balance sheet remains strong, with a total debt, net of unamortized issuance costs to capitalization ratio of 36%. 
Excluding TLLP debt and equity, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter. We also currently have $2.1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned to obtain the investment-grade ratings for both companies. Investment-grade credit ratings for Tesoro and TLLP offer substantial benefits to both companies, including lower relative debt spreads of 100 to 200 basis points over time, potential combined interest cost savings of $80 million to $105 million and most importantly, the ability to access extended debt maturities for TLLP. 
Turning to cash flows. Tesoro generated $444 million of cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. Now I'll discuss how we deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value. 
First, we invest in high-return capital projects and grow returns on invested capital. During the quarter, we invested $105 million in income growth per capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures through the first half of 2016 were approximately $400 million. We expect 2016 capital spending of approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our previously announced plan. 
Second, we continue to ensure we have some balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and return cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent approximately $80 million on 2 highly accretive acquisitions. 
We continue to look for additional opportunities and are currently focusing on targets in midstream and other assets, which can enhance our integrated business model. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $100 million. Tesoro currently has $1.3 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. We also paid quarterly dividends of $121 million and distributed $98 million to noncontrolling interest. 
Yesterday, we announced that our board approved a 10% increase to the quarterly dividend, which is now $0.55 a share or $2.20 per share annually. Additionally, during the quarter, TLLP successfully raised approximately $1 billion of debt and equity. TLLP repaid the amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and will use the balance to fund future drops and growth investments. 
As we entered 2016, given the uncertainty in MLP capital markets, Tesoro plan to support TLLP's growth and take approximately 50% of drop-down proceeds in the form of TLLP units. Given the success and the strength of TLLP's equity and debt offerings in the second quarter, Tesoro now has the flexibility to receive a greater portion of cash as consideration for future drop-downs. 
With July's Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets drop-down and the new announced Martinez -- Martinez storage and marine assets drop-down, TLLP now expects probably $50 million to $75 million of net earnings or approximately $90 million to $110 million of annual EBITDA from drop-downs from Tesoro in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 10% to 30% from previous guidance. 
This increased  EBITDA range for TLLP provides Tesoro the opportunity to obtain higher than previously expected cash proceeds from drop-downs in 2016. 
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

Tesoro's integrated business model enabled us to execute well this quarter even with the Tesoro Index 6% lower compared to the average of 2014 and 2015. We completed 2 acquisitions that further strengthened our portfolio and each has significant synergy opportunities and growth potential. 
Turning to refining operations. On the West Coast, we saw increased product demand in the quarter. Our refining utilization in California was 94%, throughput and capture rates were impacted by unplanned unit downtime in the region. 
In the Pacific Northwest, our performance was impacted by longer-than-planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery and this led to lower throughput in the region. 
In the Mid-Continent, the Tesoro Index was down approximately 34% in the second quarter to $14.65. This lower margin environment, along with narrower crude oil differentials, negatively impacted year-over-year operating results. 
For the third quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 93% and 99%. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered strong operating income and segment EBITDA growth in the quarter despite the continued weak overall commodity environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by growth in our crude oil pipeline gathering, natural gas liquids processing, terminalling and pipeline transportation throughput as well as contributions from the Los Angeles Storage and Handling Asset acquisition. 
Year-to-date, TLLP has seen volume growth of approximately 23% in crude oil pipeline gathering volumes, 5% in NGL processing throughput, 4% in terminalling throughput and 4% in pipeline transportation volumes over the same period last year. 
Additionally, on July 1, Tesoro agreed to sell storage and terminalling assets in Alaska to TLLP for $444 million. These assets include crude oil, feedstock and refined product storage tanks in Kenai, Alaska and refined product terminals in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
The total acquisition price includes cash proceeds to Tesoro of $400 million and the issuance of common and general partner units to Tesoro valued at about $44 million. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and marine assets in Martinez, California in the second half of this year. These assets could add $16 million to $36 million of annual net earnings and $40 million to $60 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. 
Also, Tesoro now expects to offer the previously announced Great Northern Midstream assets in North Dakota for sale to TLLP sometime after this year. 
Looking forward, TLLP continues to grow its business and remains on track to achieve our target of $825 million of annual operating income and $1 billion in annual segment EBITDA by year-end of next year. 
Shifting to our Marketing business. Overall performance in the quarter was good. During the second quarter, we saw continuing positive trends in the market and in our business. 
Continued strong consumer demand with gasoline demand up 2.5% through May, an increase in vehicle miles traveled of 3.4% through the same time period, growth in Tesoro's fuel volumes of about 6%, an increase -- 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network and marketing integration, as Steven said, increased to 98% versus 93% last year. 
We remain excited about the growth prospects we see in this business. Against a backdrop of a strong economy, growth in consumer demand and favorable conditions in the markets in which we operate, we continue to expand our network of stations and focus on growth opportunities towards our goal of $960 million of operating income and $1 billion of segment EBITDA by 2018. 
Turning to strategic acquisitions and project updates. We closed the acquisition of wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska in June. The acquisition enhances our capability to efficiently and reliably serve our customers in the State of Alaska. 
In addition, as I referenced earlier, we agreed to sell the Logistics portion of this acquisition to TLLP in July. We also acquired the Dakota Prairie refinery, a 20,000 barrel a day refinery in Dickinson, North Dakota and its associated business. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC concluded the 5-week hearing portion of the adjudicative phase on July 29 of this year. On -- Once EFSEC issues a final environmental impact statement, they will provide a recommendation to the Governor of Washington. 
We are very committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the West Coast.
Moving to the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project, we continue to make progress on the permitting process, the public comment period closed in mid-June and the South Coast Air Quality Management District is currently responding to the comments that were submitted and preparing the final environmental impact report. 
We continue to expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and plan to begin construction thereafter. 
As you know, we are excited about this project because it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day between gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and other criteria pollutant emissions. 
To provide you an update on the progress to deliver improvements in our business, at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based upon a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, Marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon, crude oil differentials that reflect the cost of transportation and year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $500 million to $600 million. 
Through the first half of the year, the Tesoro Index and Marketing fuel margins are basically in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials, however, continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year. 
Refining utilization is at the low end of our expectations, primarily due to unplanned maintenance. As a result, we now expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiency of $400 million to $500 million. 
Additionally, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in refining, $175 million to $200 million in logistics and $25 million to $50 million in marketing. 
As Steven said, through the first half of 2016, our estimated Refining and Marketing improvements are on track with our full year expectations, while logistics improvements are tracking slightly below the range, which is primarily attributable to slower-than-expected organic growth due to the weak commodity price environment. 
For the full year 2016, we remain committed to delivering the $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income we laid out at our Analyst and Investor Day. 
Let me conclude by saying that we are committed to creating shareholder value by continuing to optimize our assets across the value chain, driving improvements in the business and growing and transforming our portfolio of refining, logistics and marketing assets.

But as we guided into that business more and we looked at how we wanted to commercialize those assets, we always recognize when we made the acquisition that we wanted to make some changes that would provide the service and the cost effectiveness to the producers and that's just taking us a little bit longer than we anticipated. We had hoped to be able to complete it for the second half of 2016. That's going to be a little bit slower, so we'll move that forward, and we were prepared already to do the drop we're doing at Martinez in the first half of 2017.

It looks like in July, it's fallen from $15.50 to $11 a barrel. As you think about the California market, what do you think is putting pressure on it during the summer driving season? Is it a function of imports from Asia? Is it the restart of Torrance as a combination of couple different things? What's the mechanism you see that clears this up?
Yes, I think, Neil, the short-term observation that you just made for the month of July is kind of right on because that's what we have on our website as you stated. So I think it's more important to take a step back and look at the fundamental drivers in the West Coast region in the United States and from everything that we've been both observing and saying over the last couple of 2 or 3 years, you see a continued strong demand growth, the refineries have been running in the utilization rate that they typically have because the market has been in a position where to supply the product, and the -- with the demand and the overall fundamentals, we see the market as being very, very attractive from a fundamental analysis standpoint. However, today, we find ourselves in a period of time where the markets are a lot weaker, and you probably hit the nail on the head with the 2 points that you made, you had -- we did experience a little bit higher levels of imports during the transition of ownership in a refinery in California and that change in ownership is kind of working its way through the system. But as we look forward, the fundamentals to us are as attractive as they've ever been. And so we don't see anything that would indicate to us that there's any structural change in the market that would have an impact on the margin environment going forward."

In the -- from a refining standpoint, we are absolutely committed to driving a very strong operating excellence management system, which translates into high reliability in our refining operations. The second quarter was not good for us. We experienced some unplanned maintenance that we didn't expect to have and we've dealt with that. It's all been taken care off and we are running extremely well right now. So that was a little bit disappointing but it's that focus on driving that continued operating excellence in our operations. We want to be able to continue to grow both the Logistics business, and we're encouraged by what we see out there and the things that we're working on as well as the Marketing business. We're in the early stages of our plans that we talked about last year on Marketing.

And so for being able to operate it in our system, it will fit in very, very well to the Tesoro total integrated value chain. The other 2 points are that 1, we will continue to supply ultra-low sulfur diesel to the business market that the Dickinson Refinery operates in. And more encouragingly, the naphtha and resid that comes off the refinery will fit extremely well into other refineries in Tesoro, which will be able to upgrade by running it through primarily our cat crackers. So that will provide an added benefit versus what was done with the -- particularly the naphtha in the past. And then the third thing is that we are in the early stages. We see other opportunities with refineries. So the way that the refinery is constructed provides the potential opportunity to produce renewable diesel and that is something that we're in the early stages of evaluating, and we would expect to have that work done by the latter part of this year and that's important because when you look at the total system and particularly in the State of California and our need for renewable diesel, the value of producing it versus purchasing it is very, very attractive. And so we're reasonably optimistic we'll be able to make that happen going forward here. So that's the value of the Dickinson refinery to Tesoro."

Well 1, what we talked about earlier was we sold part of what was in that -- part of the EBITDA and kind of let's call it the legacy Tesoro assets, which were the Alaska assets around the Kenai refinery. But in addition, from the other bucket, the opportunities we are dropping down the acquisition that we did from Flint Hills Resources so that gives you that EBITDA number that came with that. And then the only other change is instead of taking the EBITDA that would have come from opportunities, which is the Great Northern and drop it down in the second half of this year, as I mentioned, we'll move that out of '16 and bring forward what we plan to do with Martinez that I think in the press release gave an EBITDA number of -- I don't remember what the number is.

For the last fourth quarter, rolling fourth quarter, your EBITDA per barrel is above $7.80, which is about $3 higher than your 2014 average, which is great. The only problem is that Phillips 66 and Valero look like they're up about $3.90 and $6.40 per barrel. So they actually improved far more. Now if I'm looking at in your inland system, your Mid-Con, in the same period you dropped by $9, because of the difference you dropped a lot, but if I'm looking at the inland system from Phillips 66, Valero, HollyFrontier, and Western together, they dropped a little bit more than $3.

Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $418 m",1355,"Thank you, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $418 million attributable to Tesoro or $3.47 per diluted share compared to $586 million or $4.62 a share a year ago. 
Consolidated net earnings were $449 million for the second quarter compared to $620 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA for the second quarter was $956 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. 
Reported earnings and EBITDA for the quarter included a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost of market valuation adjustment of $363 million or $220 million after-tax. 
Our second quarter 2016 results reflect continued growth in our Logistics business and strong performance in Marketing, offset by lower-than-expected performance in Refining. 
Turning to the business segments. Refining operating income was $520 million for the second quarter compared to $757 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $692 million versus $880 million last year. 
The Tesoro Index was $13.93 a barrel in the second quarter with a gross Refining margin of $15.70 a barrel or 113% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to gross Refining margin of $19.13 per barrel or 89% of the Tesoro Index last year. 
Please remember that gross Refining margin in the quarter included a pretax benefit of $363 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Total Refining throughput for the quarter was at the lower end of our guidance at 802,000 barrels a day or 92% utilization. During the quarter, we had an extension of the planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery as well as unplanned unit downtime within our California region and both of these impacted our throughput and capture rates. 
Manufacturing costs in the second quarter decreased $0.57 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.01. This year-over-year decrease was due to the higher throughput in '16 compared to 2015, but also a decline in natural gas prices. 
Tesoro's integrated business model helps mitigate our exposure to RINs. However, the price of RINs increased in the second quarter and impacted us by approximately $10 million. 
Moving to Logistics. Operating income increased to $125 million in the second quarter from $104 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $172 million from $149 million last year. 
Results benefited from year-over-year volume growth in the crude oil gathering and terminalling and transportation businesses as well as contributions from TLP's acquisition of the LA storage and handling assets. 
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $59 million during the second quarter. This is an increase of $26 million or 79% versus 2015. 
Turning to Marketing. Operating income was $161 million compared to $212 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $173 million compared to $223 million last year. 
Our fuel margins were $0.105 a gallon in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we saw continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions. These include: Growth in consumer demand; increase in vehicle miles traveled; growth in Tesoro's fuel sale volumes of 6%; and 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network; and marketing integration increased to 98% from 93% a year ago. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our continued focus on creating value for shareholders by driving improvements in our business, then I'll discuss our financial discipline and principles of capital allocation. 
We remain committed to driving improvements in the earnings of our business each year and in all cycles of the industry. In 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of operating income and EBITDA improvements through these efforts. This includes organic growth and acquisitions in our Logistics business, growth in our Marketing business and costs, yields and other efficiencies in Refining and commercial operations. We're on track to deliver these results in 2016. 
These improvements can be seen in our relative performance over time. In fact, if you look at Tesoro's earnings CAGR since 2014 versus that of our core peers, you'll see our overall earnings were down approximately 4% due to lower overall refining industry margins and crude differentials. However, the core peer group is down approximately 15% to 25%. We believe this reflects the impact of our continued focus on driving business improvements every year. 
Further, the same relative outperformance can be seen in our free cash flow yields. This continued focus on and execution of driving improvements results in significant shareholder value creation and that continues to be seen in our cash flows and capital allocation priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a consolidated cash balance of $1.1 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Our balance sheet remains strong, with a total debt, net of unamortized issuance costs to capitalization ratio of 36%. 
Excluding TLLP debt and equity, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter. We also currently have $2.1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned to obtain investment-grade ratings for both companies. Investment-grade credit ratings for Tesoro and TLLP offer substantial benefits to both companies, including lower relative debt spreads of 100 to 200 basis points over time, potential combined interest cost savings of $80 million to $105 million and most importantly, the ability to access extended debt maturities for TLLP. 
Turning to cash flows. Tesoro generated $444 million of cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. Now I'll discuss how we deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value. 
First, we invest in high-return capital projects and grow returns on invested capital. During the quarter, we invested $105 million in income growth for capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures through the first half of 2016 were approximately $400 million. We expect 2016 capital spending of approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our previously announced plan. 
Second, we continue to ensure we have a strong balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and return cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent approximately $80 million on 2 highly accretive acquisitions. 
We continue to look for additional opportunities and are currently focusing on targets in midstream and other assets which can enhance our integrated business model. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $100 million. Tesoro currently has $1.3 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. We also paid quarterly dividends of $121 million and distributed $98 million to noncontrolling interests. 
Yesterday, we announced that our board approved a 10% increase to the quarterly dividend, which is now $0.55 a share or $2.20 per share annually. Additionally, during the quarter, TLLP successfully raised approximately $1 billion of debt and equity. TLLP repaid the amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and will use the balance to fund future drops and growth investments. 
As we entered 2016, given the uncertainty in MLP capital markets, Tesoro planned to support TLLP's growth and take approximately 50% of drop-down proceeds in the form of TLLP units. Given the success and the strength of TLLP's equity and debt offerings in the second quarter, Tesoro now has the flexibility to receive a greater portion of cash as consideration for future drop-downs. 
With July's Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets drop-down and the new announced Martinez -- Martinez storage and marine assets drop-down, TLLP now expects probably $50 million to $75 million of net earnings or approximately $90 million to $110 million of annual EBITDA from drop-downs from Tesoro in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 10% to 30% from previous guidance. 
This increased EBITDA range for TLLP provides Tesoro the opportunity to obtain higher than previously expected cash proceeds from drop-downs in 2016. 
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

Tesoro's integrated business model enabled us to execute well this quarter even with the Tesoro Index 6% lower compared to the average of 2014 and 2015. We completed 2 acquisitions that further strengthened our portfolio and each has significant synergy opportunities and growth potential. 
Turning to refining operations. On the West Coast, we saw increased product demand in the quarter. Our refining utilization in California was 94%. Throughput and capture rates were impacted by unplanned unit downtime in the region. 
In the Pacific Northwest, our performance was impacted by longer-than-planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery and this led to lower throughput in the region. 
In the Mid-Continent, the Tesoro Index was down approximately 34% in the second quarter to $14.65. This lower margin environment, along with narrower crude oil differentials, negatively impacted year-over-year operating results. 
For the third quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 93% and 99%. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered strong operating income and segment EBITDA growth in the quarter despite the continued weak overall commodity environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by growth in our crude oil pipeline gathering, natural gas liquids processing, terminalling and pipeline transportation throughput as well as contributions from the Los Angeles Storage and Handling Asset acquisition. 
Year-to-date, TLLP has seen volume growth of approximately 23% in crude oil pipeline gathering volumes, 5% in NGL processing throughput, 4% in terminalling throughput and 4% in pipeline transportation volumes over the same period last year. 
Additionally, on July 1, Tesoro agreed to sell storage and terminalling assets in Alaska to TLLP for $444 million. These assets include crude oil, feedstock and refined product storage tanks in Kenai, Alaska and refined product terminals in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
The total acquisition price includes cash proceeds to Tesoro of $400 million and the issuance of common and general partner units to Tesoro valued at about $44 million. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and marine assets in Martinez, California in the second half of this year. These assets could add $16 million to $36 million of annual net earnings and $40 million to $60 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. 
Also, Tesoro now expects to offer the previously announced Great Northern Midstream assets in North Dakota for sale to TLLP sometime after this year. 
Looking forward, TLLP continues to grow its business and remains on track to achieve our target of $825 million of annual operating income and $1 billion in annual segment EBITDA by year-end of next year. 
Shifting to our Marketing business. Overall performance in the quarter was good. During the second quarter, we saw continuing positive trends in the market and in our business. 
Continued strong consumer demand with gasoline demand up 2.5% through May, an increase in vehicle miles traveled of 3.4% through the same time period, growth in Tesoro's fuel [ph] volumes of about 6%, an increase -- 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network and marketing integration, as Steven said, increased to 98% versus 93% last year. 
We remain excited about the growth prospects we see in this business. Against a backdrop of a strong economy, growth in consumer demand and favorable conditions in the markets in which we operate, we continue to expand our network of stations and focus on growth opportunities towards our goal of $960 million of operating income and $1 billion of segment EBITDA by 2018. 
Turning to strategic acquisitions and project updates. We closed the acquisition of wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska in June. The acquisition enhances our capability to efficiently and reliably serve our customers in the State of Alaska. 
In addition, as I referenced earlier, we agreed to sell the Logistics portion of this acquisition to TLLP in July. We also acquired the Dakota Prairie Refinery, a 20,000 barrel a day refinery in Dickinson, North Dakota, and its associated business. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC concluded the 5-week hearing portion of the adjudicative phase on July 29 of this year. On -- Once EFSEC issues a final environmental impact statement, they will provide a recommendation to the Governor of Washington. 
We are very committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally-responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the West Coast.
Moving to the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project. We continue to make progress on the permitting process, the public comment period closed in mid-June and the South Coast Air Quality Management District is currently responding to the comments that were submitted and preparing the final environmental impact report. 
We continue to expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and plan to begin construction thereafter. 
As you know, we are excited about this project because it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day between gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and other criteria pollutant emissions. 
To provide you an update on the progress to deliver improvements in our business, at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based upon a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon, crude oil differentials that reflect the cost of transportation and year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $500 million to $600 million. 
Through the first half of the year, the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel margins are basically in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials, however, continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year. 
Refining utilization is at the low end of our expectations, primarily due to unplanned maintenance. As a result, we now expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiency of $400 million to $500 million. 
Additionally, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in Refining, $175 million to $200 million in Logistics and $25 million to $50 million in Marketing. 
As Steven said, through the first half of 2016, our estimated Refining and Marketing improvements are on track with our full year expectations, while Logistics improvements are tracking slightly below the range, which is primarily attributable to slower-than-expected organic growth due to the weak commodity price environment. 
For the full year 2016, we remain committed to delivering the $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income we laid out at our Analyst and Investor Day. 
Let me conclude by saying that we are committed to creating shareholder value by continuing to optimize our assets across the value chain, driving improvements in the business and growing and transforming our portfolio of Refining, Logistics and Marketing assets.

But as we got into that business more and we looked at how we wanted to commercialize those assets, we always recognize when we made the acquisition that we wanted to make some changes that would provide the service and the cost effectiveness to the producers, and that's just taking us a little bit longer than we anticipated. We had hoped to be able to complete it for the second half of 2016. That's going to be a little bit slower, so we'll move that forward, and we were prepared already to do the drop we're doing at Martinez in the first half of 2017.

However, today, we find ourselves in a period of time where the market's a lot weaker, and you probably hit the nail on the head with the 2 points that you made, you had -- we did experience a little bit higher levels of imports during the transition of ownership in a refinery in California and that change in ownership is kind of working its way through the system.

When you've talked before or if you look back several years ago, the thought was always that if California refineries or West Coast refineries ran full out, the market was a little oversupplied. One goes down, the market gets great. You made the comment that we don't need any extra product right now and it seems to me that most of the West Coast is running fairly well. Have there been any changes in the way you're looking at that? Has demand been a little bit weaker or it's just a function of the imports that came in earlier? I'm just trying to get kind of a feeling of that fundamental shift underway in the West Coast of sort of almost permanent undersupply or exactly what we're looking at?"

When you do just a pure fundamental analysis of the West Coast market, our indications are when refineries run at relatively high utilization rates that the gasoline market needs a small amount of imports to meet the needs of the marketplace and that analysis hasn't changed.

We see refineries running at the higher end of the utilization versus historical levels and the inventory levels are at a comfortable level, they are kind of where they are on a 5-year average standpoint.

I think there are 3 key points to make about the -- what we now refer to as the Dickinson Refinery is that 1, because of our system approach to operating the business, we will be able to deliver probably more than what we stated earlier from a synergy impact. If you recall our press release, we stated that we expect it to deliver about $20 million of synergies. And once we got actually into the business, which I'll remind you has only been about 30 days, we've actually seen more opportunities in that, which is always encouraging. And so for being able to operate it in our system, it will fit in very, very well to the Tesoro total integrated value chain. The other 2 points are that 1, we will continue to supply ultra-low sulfur diesel to the business market that the Dickinson Refinery operates in. And more encouragingly, the naphtha and resid that comes off the refinery will fit extremely well into other refineries in Tesoro, which we'll be able to upgrade by running it through primarily our cat crackers. So that will provide an added benefit versus what was done with the -- particularly the naphtha in the past. And then the third thing is that we are in the early stages. We see other opportunities with the refineries. So the way that the refinery is constructed provides the potential opportunity to produce renewable diesel and that is something that we're in the early stages of evaluating, and we would expect to have that work done by the latter part of this year, and that's important because when you look at the total system, and particularly in the State of California, and our need for renewable diesel, the value of producing it versus purchasing it is very, very attractive. And so we're reasonably optimistic we'll be able to make that happen going forward here. So that's the value of the Dickinson refinery to Tesoro."

Just curious as to how sustainable that result out there is and maybe just some kind of drivers you can point to in the quarter. I only ask because a lot of the peers have actually seen pretty sizable drops quarter-on-quarter. So it's just kind of contrary to what has happened out there."

The first piece we said was that with the existing assets in the company, we had somewhere -- I'm just going off my memory here, but something between $350 million to $500 million of EBITDA attributable to those assets. And then we said we had another $150 million to $250 million or so with things that we're working on that would ultimately be dropped down in there, and that hasn't changed. That is unchanged from what we said then. So what have we done? Well 1, what we talked about earlier was we sold part of what was in that -- part of the EBITDA and that kind of, let's call it the legacy Tesoro assets, which were the Alaska assets around the Kenai refinery. But in addition, from the other bucket, the opportunities we are dropping down the acquisition that we did from Flint Hills Resources, so that gives you that EBITDA number that came with that. And then the only other change is instead of taking the EBITDA that would have come from opportunities, which is the Great Northern and drop it down in the second half of this year, as I mentioned, we'll move that out of '16 and bring forward what we planned to do with Martinez that I think in the press release gave an EBITDA number of -- I don't remember what the number is. What is it? Up to around -- up to about $50 million. So that, you can just see how that affects the 2 buckets of opportunities that we talked about. So not a big change."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg.

I'll review our second quarter 2016 financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $418 million attributable to Tesoro or $3.47 per diluted share compared to $586 million or $4.62 a share a year ago. 
Consolidated net earnings were $449 million for the second quarter compared to $620 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA for the second quarter was $956 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. 
Reported earnings and EBITDA for the quarter included a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost of market valuation adjustment of $363 million or $220 million after-tax. 
Our second quarter 2016 results reflect continued growth in our Logistics business and strong performance in Marketing, offset by lower-than-expected performance in Refining. 
Turning to the business segments. Refining operating income was $520 million for the second quarter compared to $757 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $692 million versus $880 million last year. 
The Tesoro Index was $13.93 a barrel in the second quarter with a gross Refining margin of $15.70 a barrel or 113% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to gross Refining margin of $19.13 per barrel or 89% of the Tesoro Index last year. 
Please remember that gross Refining margin in the quarter included a pretax benefit of $363 million related to the LCM inventory adjustment. 
Total Refining throughput for the quarter was at the lower end of our guidance at 802,000 barrels a day or 92% utilization. During the quarter, we had an extension of the planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery as well as unplanned unit downtime within our California region and both of these impacted our throughput and capture rates. 
Manufacturing costs in the second quarter decreased $0.57 a barrel over the same period last year to $5.01. This year-over-year decrease was due to the higher throughput in '16 compared to 2015, but also a decline in natural gas prices. 
Tesoro's integrated business model helps mitigate our exposure to RINs. However, the price of RINs increased in the second quarter and impacted us by approximately $10 million. 
Moving to Logistics. Operating income increased to $125 million in the second quarter from $104 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $172 million from $149 million last year. 
Results benefited from year-over-year volume growth in the crude oil gathering and terminalling and transportation businesses as well as contributions from TLP's acquisition of the LA storage and handling assets. 
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $59 million during the second quarter. This is an increase of $26 million or 79% versus 2015. 
Turning to Marketing. Operating income was $161 million compared to $212 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $173 million compared to $223 million last year. 
Our fuel margins were $0.105 a gallon in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we saw continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions. These include: Growth in consumer demand; increase in vehicle miles traveled; growth in Tesoro's fuel sale volumes of 6%; and 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network; and marketing integration increased to 98% from 93% a year ago. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our continued focus on creating value for shareholders by driving improvements in our business, then I'll discuss our financial discipline and principles of capital allocation. 
We remain committed to driving improvements in the earnings of our business each year and in all cycles of the industry. In 2016, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of operating income and EBITDA improvements through these efforts. This includes organic growth and acquisitions in our Logistics business, growth in our Marketing business and costs, yields and other efficiencies in Refining and commercial operations. We're on track to deliver these results in 2016. 
These improvements can be seen in our relative performance over time. In fact, if you look at Tesoro's earnings CAGR since 2014 versus that of our core peers, you'll see our overall earnings were down approximately 4% due to lower overall refining industry margins and crude differentials. However, the core peer group is down approximately 15% to 25%. We believe this reflects the impact of our continued focus on driving business improvements every year. 
Further, the same relative outperformance can be seen in our free cash flow yields. This continued focus on and execution of driving improvements results in significant shareholder value creation and that continues to be seen in our cash flows and capital allocation priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a consolidated cash balance of $1.1 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Our balance sheet remains strong, with a total debt, net of unamortized issuance costs to capitalization ratio of 36%. 
Excluding TLLP debt and equity, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter. We also currently have $2.1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned to obtain investment-grade ratings for both companies. Investment-grade credit ratings for Tesoro and TLLP offer substantial benefits to both companies, including lower relative debt spreads of 100 to 200 basis points over time, potential combined interest cost savings of $80 million to $105 million and most importantly, the ability to access extended debt maturities for TLLP. 
Turning to cash flows. Tesoro generated $444 million of cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter. Now I'll discuss how we deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value. 
First, we invest in high-return capital projects and grow returns on invested capital. During the quarter, we invested $105 million in income growth for capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures through the first half of 2016 were approximately $400 million. We expect 2016 capital spending of approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our previously announced plan. 
Second, we continue to ensure we have a strong balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and return cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent approximately $80 million on 2 highly accretive acquisitions. 
We continue to look for additional opportunities and are currently focusing on targets in midstream and other assets which can enhance our integrated business model. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $100 million. Tesoro currently has $1.3 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase program. We also paid quarterly dividends of $121 million and distributed $98 million to noncontrolling interests. 
Yesterday, we announced that our board approved a 10% increase to the quarterly dividend, which is now $0.55 a share or $2.20 per share annually. Additionally, during the quarter, TLLP successfully raised approximately $1 billion of debt and equity. TLLP repaid the amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility, and will use the balance to fund future drops and growth investments. 
As we entered 2016, given the uncertainty in MLP capital markets, Tesoro planned to support TLLP's growth and take approximately 50% of drop-down proceeds in the form of TLLP units. Given the success and the strength of TLLP's equity and debt offerings in the second quarter, Tesoro now has the flexibility to receive a greater portion of cash as consideration for future drop-downs. 
With July's Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets drop-down and the new announced Martinez -- Martinez storage and marine assets drop-down, TLLP now expects probably $50 million to $75 million of net earnings or approximately $90 million to $110 million of annual EBITDA from drop-downs from Tesoro in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 10% to 30% from previous guidance. 
This increased EBITDA range for TLLP provides Tesoro the opportunity to obtain higher than previously expected cash proceeds from drop-downs in 2016. 
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our second quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

Tesoro's integrated business model enabled us to execute well this quarter even with the Tesoro Index 6% lower compared to the average of 2014 and 2015. We completed 2 acquisitions that further strengthened our portfolio and each has significant synergy opportunities and growth potential. 
Turning to refining operations. On the West Coast, we saw increased product demand in the quarter. Our refining utilization in California was 94%. Throughput and capture rates were impacted by unplanned unit downtime in the region. 
In the Pacific Northwest, our performance was impacted by longer-than-planned maintenance at our Kenai, Alaska refinery and this led to lower throughput in the region. 
In the Mid-Continent, the Tesoro Index was down approximately 34% in the second quarter to $14.65. This lower margin environment, along with narrower crude oil differentials, negatively impacted year-over-year operating results. 
For the third quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 93% and 99%. 
Moving to Logistics. Tesoro Logistics delivered strong operating income and segment EBITDA growth in the quarter despite the continued weak overall commodity environment. TLLP's performance in the quarter was driven by growth in our crude oil pipeline gathering, natural gas liquids processing, terminalling and pipeline transportation throughput as well as contributions from the Los Angeles Storage and Handling Asset acquisition. 
Year-to-date, TLLP has seen volume growth of approximately 23% in crude oil pipeline gathering volumes, 5% in NGL processing throughput, 4% in terminalling throughput and 4% in pipeline transportation volumes over the same period last year. 
Additionally, on July 1, Tesoro agreed to sell storage and terminalling assets in Alaska to TLLP for $444 million. These assets include crude oil, feedstock and refined product storage tanks in Kenai, Alaska and refined product terminals in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
The total acquisition price includes cash proceeds to Tesoro of $400 million and the issuance of common and general partner units to Tesoro valued at about $44 million. 
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and marine assets in Martinez, California in the second half of this year. These assets could add $16 million to $36 million of annual net earnings and $40 million to $60 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. 
Also, Tesoro now expects to offer the previously announced Great Northern Midstream assets in North Dakota for sale to TLLP sometime after this year. 
Looking forward, TLLP continues to grow its business and remains on track to achieve our target of $825 million of annual operating income and $1 billion in annual segment EBITDA by year-end of next year. 
Shifting to our Marketing business. Overall performance in the quarter was good. During the second quarter, we saw continuing positive trends in the market and in our business. 
Continued strong consumer demand with gasoline demand up 2.5% through May, an increase in vehicle miles traveled of 3.4% through the same time period, growth in Tesoro's fuel [ph] volumes of about 6%, an increase -- 8% increase in the total number of stations in our network and marketing integration, as Steven said, increased to 98% versus 93% last year. 
We remain excited about the growth prospects we see in this business. Against a backdrop of a strong economy, growth in consumer demand and favorable conditions in the markets in which we operate, we continue to expand our network of stations and focus on growth opportunities towards our goal of $960 million of operating income and $1 billion of segment EBITDA by 2018. 
Turning to strategic acquisitions and project updates. We closed the acquisition of wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska in June. The acquisition enhances our capability to efficiently and reliably serve our customers in the State of Alaska. 
In addition, as I referenced earlier, we agreed to sell the Logistics portion of this acquisition to TLLP in July. We also acquired the Dakota Prairie Refinery, a 20,000 barrel a day refinery in Dickinson, North Dakota, and its associated business. 
A brief update on the Vancouver Energy project. The Washington State's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council or EFSEC concluded the 5-week hearing portion of the adjudicative phase on July 29 of this year. On -- Once EFSEC issues a final environmental impact statement, they will provide a recommendation to the Governor of Washington. 
We are very committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe, environmentally-responsible facility that offers benefits to the State of Washington and the West Coast.
Moving to the Los Angeles Refinery integration and compliance project. We continue to make progress on the permitting process, the public comment period closed in mid-June and the South Coast Air Quality Management District is currently responding to the comments that were submitted and preparing the final environmental impact report. 
We continue to expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and plan to begin construction thereafter. 
As you know, we are excited about this project because it enhances our position on the West Coast and offers several benefits, including the full integration of the Carson and Wilmington operations, yield flexibility of 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day between gasoline and distillates and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and other criteria pollutant emissions. 
To provide you an update on the progress to deliver improvements in our business, at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based upon a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon, crude oil differentials that reflect the cost of transportation and year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $500 million to $600 million. 
Through the first half of the year, the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel margins are basically in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials, however, continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year. 
Refining utilization is at the low end of our expectations, primarily due to unplanned maintenance. As a result, we now expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiency of $400 million to $500 million. 
Additionally, we committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in Refining, $175 million to $200 million in Logistics and $25 million to $50 million in Marketing. 
As Steven said, through the first half of 2016, our estimated Refining and Marketing improvements are on track with our full year expectations, while Logistics improvements are tracking slightly below the range, which is primarily attributable to slower-than-expected organic growth due to the weak commodity price environment. 
For the full year 2016, we remain committed to delivering the $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income we laid out at our Analyst and Investor Day. 
Let me conclude by saying that we are committed to creating shareholder value by continuing to optimize our assets across the value chain, driving improvements in the business and growing and transforming our portfolio of Refining, Logistics and Marketing assets.

The second one originally was anticipated to be what we refer to as the Great Northern pipeline system in North Dakota, which was the acquisition that Tesoro made in January of this year. But as we got into that business more and we looked at how we wanted to commercialize those assets, we always recognize when we made the acquisition that we wanted to make some changes that would provide the service and the cost effectiveness to the producers, and that's just taking us a little bit longer than we anticipated. We had hoped to be able to complete it for the second half of 2016.

However, today, we find ourselves in a period of time where the market's a lot weaker, and you probably hit the nail on the head with the 2 points that you made, you had -- we did experience a little bit higher levels of imports during the transition of ownership in a refinery in California and that change in ownership is kind of working its way through the system.

So we see a very good outlook for the supply to the customers in the third quarter. The -- your second question about the -- how our shares show up in the marketplace, I think, just probably 3 or 4 key comments. One is, as you know and everyone else knows, we are absolutely committed to continue to drive improvements in the business, which we've demonstrated to be very good at being able to deliver those improvements. And as both Steven and I stated, we're on track to accomplish what we laid out for this year and we'll lay out our plans for next year at the end of this year. So I think that's important. In the -- from a refining standpoint, we are absolutely committed to driving a very strong operating excellence management system, which translates into high reliability in our refining operations. The second quarter was not good for us. We experienced some unplanned maintenance that we didn't expect to have and we've dealt with that. It's all been taken care of and we are running extremely well right now. So that was a little bit disappointing, but it's that focus on driving that continued operating excellence in our operations. We want to be able to continue to grow both the Logistics business, and we're encouraged by what we see out there and the things that we're working on as well as the Marketing business. We're in the early stages of our plans that we talked about last year on Marketing. We -- Steven mentioned that the number of our station count is up about 8% year-on-year, which is strong growth primarily in what people refer to as the wholesale or the jobber channel, and we continue to drive fundamental improvements in the Marketing business. So we're going to stay absolutely focused on those commitments that we've made to drive the improvements in the business, and we believe that the market will see the impact of that as we move forward over time."

I think there are 3 key points to make about the -- what we now refer to as the Dickinson Refinery is that 1, because of our system approach to operating the business, we will be able to deliver probably more than what we stated earlier from a synergy impact. If you recall our press release, we stated that we expect it to deliver about $20 million of synergies. And once we got actually into the business, which I'll remind you has only been about 30 days, we've actually seen more opportunities in that, which is always encouraging. And so for being able to operate it in our system, it will fit in very, very well to the Tesoro total integrated value chain. The other 2 points are that 1, we will continue to supply ultra-low sulfur diesel to the business market that the Dickinson Refinery operates in. And more encouragingly, the naphtha and resid that comes off the refinery will fit extremely well into other refineries in Tesoro, which we'll be able to upgrade by running it through primarily our cat crackers. So that will provide an added benefit versus what was done with the -- particularly the naphtha in the past. And then the third thing is that we are in the early stages. We see other opportunities with the refineries. So the way that the refinery is constructed provides the potential opportunity to produce renewable diesel and that is something that we're in the early stages of evaluating, and we would expect to have that work done by the latter part of this year, and that's important because when you look at the total system, and particularly in the State of California, and our need for renewable diesel, the value of producing it versus purchasing it is very, very attractive. And so we're reasonably optimistic we'll be able to make that happen going forward here. So that's the value of the Dickinson refinery to Tesoro."

We see about 140,000 barrel a day need for product on the west coast of Mexico for gasoline and distillates and kind of a natural place for that is to have the system balance across that whole Western region. And so as a company, we've stated many times in the past that it's a natural part of our system and moving product into Mexico, Chile and Peru primarily. We don't see any structural changes in that. We still see, especially Mexico to have the strong need and healthy and reasonably good demand growth.

The first piece we said was that with the existing assets in the company, we had somewhere -- I'm just going off my memory here, but something between $350 million to $500 million of EBITDA attributable to those assets. And then we said we had another $150 million to $250 million or so with things that we're working on that would ultimately be dropped down in there, and that hasn't changed. That is unchanged from what we said then. So what have we done? Well 1, what we talked about earlier was we sold part of what was in that -- part of the EBITDA and that kind of, let's call it the legacy Tesoro assets, which were the Alaska assets around the Kenai refinery. But in addition, from the other bucket, the opportunities we are dropping down the acquisition that we did from Flint Hills Resources, so that gives you that EBITDA number that came with that. And then the only other change is instead of taking the EBITDA that would have come from opportunities, which is the Great Northern and drop it down in the second half of this year, as I mentioned, we'll move that out of '16 and bring forward what we planned to do with Martinez that I think in the press release gave an EBITDA number of -- I don't remember what the number is. What is it? Up to around -- up to about $50 million. So that, you can just see how that affects the 2 buckets of opportunities that we talked about. So not a big change."

I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg.

I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $170 million attributable to Tesoro or $1.43 per diluted share compared to $759 million or $6.13 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated net earnings were $201 million for the third quarter compared to $799 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA was $577 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago.
Operating income in the third quarter grew year-over-year in Logistics, but was lower in refining and marketing due to a stronger than normal market environment in 2015.
Turning to our business segments. 
Refining operating income was $52 million for the third quarter compared to $899 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $204 million versus $1 billion last year. Operating income and segment EBITDA for the quarter include a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost to market valuation adjustment of $20 million, offset by a $14 million charge related to a contract dispute with the supplier.
The Tesoro Index was $12.45 a barrel for the third quarter, with a gross refining margin of $9.08 per barrel or 73% capture of the Tesoro Index. This compares to the Tesoro Index of $23.09 and a gross refining margin of $19.43 or 84% capture for last year. 
Refining margins in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the following 3 items: first, an overall lower refining margin environment; second, rise in RINs prices. Let me remind you that our refining sales to our marketing business are based on spot prices less the fall RIN costs. So in a quarter where RINs costs rise, we reflect the higher obligation in refining and the benefit from blending in our marketing segment. It is important to note that we run our business in the integrated manner. This does not have a material impact on total company results. 
And lastly, we continue to look for ways to drive improvements in our business and capital allocation. One of the ways we do this is by driving improvements in working capital. In the third quarter, we successfully reduced inventory and generated approximately $150 million in cash as a result. This inventory reduction had a positive impact on cash flow, but a negative impact on refining margins in the quarter.
Total refining throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels a day or 98% utilization, which was at the high end of our expectations.
Manufacturing costs in the third quarter increased $0.27 per barrel over the same period last year to $5.11. This year-over-year increase was largely due to the addition of the Dickinson refinery and the Tesoro Great Plains assets acquired in 2016.
Moving to Logistics. 
Operating income increased to $133 million in the third quarter from $106 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $181 million from $153 million last year. This performance was driven by the following factors: year-over-year growth in TLP's crude oil gathering, terminalling and transportation throughput; growth from the acquisition of the Los Angeles storage and pipeline assets last year; and growth from the Alaska storage and terminalling assets acquisition made during the quarter.
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $65 million during the third quarter. This is an increase of $27 million or 71% versus 2015.
Turning to marketing. 
Operating income was $273 million compared to $379 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $285 million compared to $390 million last year. The fuel margins were $0.149 a gallon in the third quarter versus $0.205 a gallon last year. 
During the quarter, we saw a continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions, including growth in consumer demand and an increase in vehicle miles traveled. We are pleased with our operating results in the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and our strategic priorities for creating long-term shareholder value.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with the consolidated cash balance of $1.4 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Total debt to capitalization was 36% at the end of the quarter. Excluding TLP debt and equity, our debt to capitalization ratio was 19%.
We have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. And we continue to progress towards our goal of obtaining investment grade credit ratings for Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics.
As you may be aware, at the end of the quarter, Tesoro entered into a new $2 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. This new 4-year cash flow credit facility replaces our $3 billion asset base credit facility. The new credit facility will become unsecured upon Tesoro achieving an investment grade rating from either Moody's or S&P. Additionally, on October 14, S&P upgraded TLP's credit rating by 1 level to BB+, with a stable outlook. This new rating is now the same as that as Tesoro in just 1 notch below investment grade.
Turning to cash flows. 
Tesoro generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2016, including $573 million in the third quarter. 
I'd like to discuss how we continued to deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value.
First, we invest in high return capital projects and improve returns on invested capital. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $296 million in income and growth capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures were approximately $624 million. And we now expect full year 2016 capital spending of approximately $900 million. This is a reduction from our previous expectations of approximately $1 billion.
Next, we ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and also return cash to shareholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we spent approximately $412 million on accretive acquisitions. We executed $3.2 million in share repurchases for approximately $250 million, including 1.9 million shares for approximately $150 million during the quarter. We also paid dividends of $186 million and distributed $155 million to third-party LP unitholders.
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our fourth quarter outlook in our earnings release that was issued yesterday.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We are pleased with our results for the quarter, which can be attributed to our integrated business model and the continued execution of our operating improvements. 
Our operational reliability was very strong. Combined with our continued growth in Logistics and our integrated marketing business, we generated strong operating cash flows. Also, this quarter, we returned $215 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to our operations. 
Let me start with refining. As Steven mentioned previously, total refinery throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels per day or 98% utilization and gross refining margin was $9.08 per barrel. 
In our California region, we continued to see product demand growth. We operate in our refineries well with a utilization of 98%, which was at the high end of our guidance. 
In our Pacific Northwest region, throughput was higher than our expectations, but our operating performance was impacted by a lower refining margin environment, wins pricing and products mix due to an impact of a reduction of inventory. 
In the Mid-Continent, throughput was within our expectation. However, operating results were impacted by a lower refining margin environment and a charge related to a contract settlement with a supplier. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 90% and 96%.
Moving to Logistics. 
We continued to execute on our strategy of growing this business through organic investment, strategic acquisitions and acquisitions by Tesoro. TLLP delivered strong operating income growth in the quarter. TLLP's quarter results were driven by the terminalling and transportation segment, which generated record revenues, operating income and EBITDA. During the quarter, TLLP completed the acquisition of the Alaska storage and terminalling assets from Tesoro, and this contributed to the segment's operating performance.
Crude oil gathering volumes increased to 206,000 barrels per day versus 199,000 barrels per day last year despite a challenging commodity price environment. While this headwind still exists in our gathering and processing operations, we continued to invest in attractive organic projects, such as interconnections on the high point system and compression projects in our natural gas gathering system.
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire the northern California terminalling and storage assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The assets could add $28 million to $33 million of annual net earnings and $45 million to $50 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its goal of $820 million of annual operating income and $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017.
Now shifting to marketing. 
Our performance in the quarter was strong. During the quarter, we saw a continued favorable trends in the market, including strong consumer demand with U.S. gasoline demand up 3% year-over-year through September, and an increase in vehicle miles traveled of 3.2% year-over-year in the U.S. and 4.8% year-over-year in California through August. Also, we increased our branded store count by 178 stations year-over-year to 2,467. We continue to successfully execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
We see continued favorable market fundamentals driven by a strong economy and growth in consumer demand in the regions in which we operate. We remain excited about the organic growth prospects in our marketing business. These include implementing improvements in our stations, expanding our network of stations and investing in our brands.
Now let me discuss the acquisitions we made during the quarter and also provide you an update on major capital projects. 
On the acquisition front. In September, we acquired Vibrant Incorporated, an innovative renewable fuels and chemicals company. This acquisition supports our renewable fuel strategy of developing high-quality, low-carbon renewable feedstocks and blend stocks that can be either co-processed in our existing refineries or blended seamlessly with traditional fuels. Also, by generating valuable renewable fuels credits, we could lower our compliance costs with both the federal renewable fuel standard and California's low carbon fuel standard.
During the quarter, we closed both portions of the sale of the Alaska storage and terminalling assets to TLLP for a total consideration to Tesoro of $444 million, paid as $400 million in cash and approximately $44 million of TLLP common and general partner units.
To give you an update on our Vancouver Energy project. The energy facility Site Evaluation Council concluded adjudicated hearings in September with the filing of all parties post hearing briefs. On October 6, Vancouver Energy submitted its revised permit application to EFSEC in keeping with the council's hearing rules and regulations.
In the revised permit application, Vancouver Energy offered many conditions that are well above regulatory requirements. This includes a performance-based throughput structure by which EFSEC could limit the project's initial throughput to 180,000 barrels per day or 50% of the originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day. This structure includes the ability to incrementally increase the facility throughput by 90,000 barrels per day after 12 consecutive months of acceptable safety and environmental performance. Two consecutive performance periods would result in their originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day facility. EFSEC is now deliberating its recommendation to the Governor of Washington.
We are committed to the proposed crude oil rail to marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington in the entire West Coast.
Regarding the Los Angeles refinery integration and compliance project. The South Coast Air Quality Management district is making progress on preparing the final environmental impact report. A certified environmental impact report will allow the main permitting entities to approve the project. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and begin construction shortly thereafter.
To update you on our progress to deliver improvements in our business. You will recall that at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based on 3 things: 1, the Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; 2, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and 3, crude oil differentials that reflected the cost of transportation.
Through the first 9 months of 2016, the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel margins are in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year.
Tesoro continues to expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $400 million to $500 million. We're also committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in refining, $175 million to $200 million in logistics and $25 million to $50 million in marketing. Even in the current challenging market environment, we are confident that we will deliver the $400 million to $500 million of total annual improvements to operating income.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our estimated refining and marketing improvements are trending above the range. However, estimated logistics improvements are trending slightly below the range, primarily due to the weak commodity price environment, which has impacted organic growth and volumes.
Before I conclude, I would like to remind you that we will be hosting our 2016 Investor and Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City. My leadership team and I look forward to updating you on the company strategic outlook and outlining our plans for 2017. For additional details on this event, please follow-up with our Investor Relations team.
To conclude, we have built a strong integrated refining, logistics and marketing business and have a competitive position in our market. This enables us to drive significant operational improvements, create sustainable earnings growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Thank you. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator?"

As we've talked before, we're in logistics business because we see substantial opportunities to continue to grow the business, both organically and through acquisition. And as you mentioned, we're in MLP because we need access to low-cost capital to do that. Over time, as we've grown the business substantially, the IDR structure does have an impact on the cost of capital of the MLP. We see that, we acknowledge it and understand it. As we look forward, it's critical because we do see continued opportunity for high return investment within the logistics business, for the MLP to have very high attractive cost to capital, for our unit holders to have accretion opportunities as we grow the business, and for Tesoro to continue to receive cash, and MLP to be a source of cash for Tesoro to reduce our cost to capital over time. And so we absolutely view that as part of our ongoing and long-term strategy. And we'll as always continue to look at all the options that are out there to allow us to continue to both grow the business and have a low cost to capital. And on your second question about investment grade, if you look at Tesoro and TLLP's balance sheet, if you look at what we've done with cash flow and capital allocation and leverage, we think the companies are very high quality and meet most, if not all, investment-grade ratings, and think that managing cost to capital and options that are there only support that and it wouldn't take away from that."

And we've been able to drive other improvements in the business. And you're exactly right, we have looked at opportunities to acquire assets that would fit into our integrated business model.

We are in the final stages of completing our planning for '17, and '18 and '19 as we go out and look at our plans to execute on the various projects that we're undertaking.

I think when we acquired it, we made some brief comments on the facility. And relative to the things that we've identified at the front-end before we closed the transaction, our people have been incredibly successful capturing those benefits. And so relative to our outlook, we're basically on target with what we thought we would do. We've done some interesting things with it. For example, in the quarter, we just completed a turnaround in Salt Lake City on the crude unit just within the last few days. And one of the things we're able to do is is we're able to take the from the Dickinson refinery and run it through the cut cracker in Salt Lake and make gasoline to supply the market during the downtime in the refinery which worked extremely well. And we've similarly done that by taking some of the to Anacortes to run through the cut cracker in Anacortes, and so the benefits -- the additional benefits that we're seeing are working out really, really well for us. And so what we do not see anything materially different than when we first talked about it. Now it wasn't -- it doesn't have a significant impact on the company overall, but those -- even though small little things that I talked about are very attractive to what we're trying to do. So no surprises and good execution with what we set out to do."

And they have been doing development on producing both -- different types of renewable fuels and renewable kind of petrochemicals, almost like a renewable mixed xylene that could be used to make polyester. So that company has had actually very good success over time. And when Tesoro got involved in the business, within the last couple of years, we acquired an option with the potential to ultimately acquire the business, which we did during the quarter. And like I said in the brief statements that I made about Vibrant, we the ability to make the product that they're targeting is very, very well developed. There Is not a lot of uncertainty about that, so that part we feel really good about. We are working to progress that on a scale up basis, and that's very advanced to being able to scale up the production of that. And our primary interest is to be able to supply with our fuel, the renewable component of it and particularly to be able to meet some of the requirements in the state of California, and so we will continue to work on the scale up of the business.

Most companies, and us included, it's access to say and diesel, biodiesel RINs and credits where that's where that is the challenge is.

I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $170 milli",1111,"Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $170 million attributable to Tesoro or $1.43 per diluted share compared to $759 million or $6.13 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated net earnings were $201 million for the third quarter compared to $799 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA was $577 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago.
Operating income in the third quarter grew year-over-year in Logistics, but was lower in refining and marketing due to a stronger than normal market environment in 2015.
Turning to our business segments. 
Refining operating income was $52 million for the third quarter compared to $899 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $204 million versus $1 billion last year. Operating income and segment EBITDA for the quarter include a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of $20 million, offset by a $14 million charge related to a contract dispute with the supplier.
The Tesoro Index was $12.45 a barrel for the third quarter, with a gross refining margin of $9.08 per barrel or 73% capture of the Tesoro Index. This compares to the Tesoro Index of $23.09 and a gross refining margin of $19.43 or 84% capture for last year. 
Refining margins in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the following 3 items: first, an overall lower refining margin environment; second, rise in RINs prices. Let me remind you that our refining sales to our marketing business are based on spot prices less the full RIN costs. So in a quarter where RINs costs rise, we reflect the higher obligation in refining and the benefit from blending in our marketing segment. It is important to note that we run our business in the integrated manner. This does not have a material impact on total company results. 
And lastly, we continue to look for ways to drive improvements in our business and capital allocation. One of the ways we do this is by driving improvements in working capital. In the third quarter, we successfully reduced inventory and generated approximately $150 million in cash as a result. This inventory reduction had a positive impact on cash flow, but a negative impact on refining margins in the quarter.
Total refining throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels a day or 98% utilization, which was at the high end of our expectations.
Manufacturing costs in the third quarter increased $0.27 per barrel over the same period last year to $5.11. This year-over-year increase was largely due to the addition of the Dickinson refinery and the Tesoro Great Plains assets acquired in 2016.
Moving to Logistics. 
Operating income increased to $133 million in the third quarter from $106 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $181 million from $153 million last year. This performance was driven by the following factors: year-over-year growth in TLP's crude oil gathering, terminalling and transportation throughput; growth from the acquisition of the Los Angeles Storage and Pipeline Assets last year; and growth from the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets acquisition made during the quarter.
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $65 million during the third quarter. This is an increase of $27 million or 71% versus 2015.
Turning to marketing. 
Operating income was $273 million compared to $379 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $285 million compared to $390 million last year. The fuel margins were $0.149 a gallon in the third quarter versus $0.205 a gallon last year. 
During the quarter, we saw a continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions, including growth in consumer demand and an increase in vehicle miles traveled. We are pleased with our operating results in the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and our strategic priorities for creating long-term shareholder value.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with the consolidated cash balance of $1.4 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Total debt to capitalization was 36% at the end of the quarter. Excluding TLP debt and equity, our debt to capitalization ratio was 19%.
We have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. And we continue to progress towards our goal of obtaining investment grade credit ratings for Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics.
As you may be aware, at the end of the quarter, Tesoro entered into a new $2 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. This new 4-year cash flow credit facility replaces our $3 billion asset base credit facility. The new credit facility will become unsecured upon Tesoro achieving an investment grade rating from either Moody's or S&P. Additionally, on October 14, S&P upgraded TLP's credit rating by 1 level to BB+, with a stable outlook. This new rating is now the same as that as Tesoro in just 1 notch below investment grade.
Turning to cash flows. 
Tesoro generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2016, including $573 million in the third quarter. 
I'd like to discuss how we continued to deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value.
First, we invest in high return capital projects and improve returns on invested capital. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $296 million in income and growth capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures were approximately $624 million. And we now expect full year 2016 capital spending of approximately $900 million. This is a reduction from our previous expectations of approximately $1 billion.
Next, we ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and also return cash to shareholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we spent approximately $412 million on accretive acquisitions. We executed $3.2 million in share repurchases for approximately $250 million, including 1.9 million shares for approximately $150 million during the quarter. We also paid dividends of $186 million and distributed $155 million to third-party LP unitholders.
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our fourth quarter outlook in our earnings release that was issued yesterday.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We are pleased with our results for the quarter, which can be attributed to our integrated business model and the continued execution of our operating improvements. 
Our operational reliability was very strong. Combined with our continued growth in Logistics and our integrated marketing business, we generated strong operating cash flows. Also, this quarter, we returned $215 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to our operations. 
Let me start with refining. As Steven mentioned previously, total refinery throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels per day or 98% utilization and gross refining margin was $9.08 per barrel. 
In our California region, we continued to see product demand growth. We operate in our refineries well with a utilization of 98%, which was at the high end of our guidance. 
In our Pacific Northwest region, throughput was higher than our expectations, but our operating performance was impacted by a lower refining margin environment, wins pricing and products mix due to an impact of a reduction of inventory. 
In the Mid-Continent, throughput was within our expectation. However, operating results were impacted by a lower refining margin environment and a charge related to a contract settlement with a supplier. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 90% and 96%.
Moving to Logistics. 
We continued to execute on our strategy of growing this business through organic investment, strategic acquisitions and acquisitions by Tesoro. TLLP delivered strong operating income growth in the quarter. TLLP's quarter results were driven by the terminalling and transportation segment, which generated record revenues, operating income and EBITDA. During the quarter, TLLP completed the acquisition of the Alaska storage and terminalling assets from Tesoro, and this contributed to the segment's operating performance.
Crude oil gathering volumes increased to 206,000 barrels per day versus 199,000 barrels per day last year despite a challenging commodity price environment. While this headwind still exists in our gathering and processing operations, we continue to invest in attractive organic projects, such as interconnections on the High Plains System and compression projects in our natural gas gathering system.
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire the northern California terminalling and storage assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The assets could add $28 million to $33 million of annual net earnings and $45 million to $50 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its goal of $820 million of annual operating income and $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017.
Now shifting to marketing. 
Our performance in the quarter was strong. During the quarter, we saw a continued favorable trends in the market, including strong consumer demand with U.S. gasoline demand up 3% year-over-year through September, and an increase in vehicle miles traveled of 3.2% year-over-year in the U.S. and 4.8% year-over-year in California through August. Also, we increased our branded store count by 178 stations year-over-year to 2,467. We continue to successfully execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
We see continued favorable market fundamentals driven by a strong economy and growth in consumer demand in the regions in which we operate. We remain excited about the organic growth prospects in our marketing business. These include implementing improvements in our stations, expanding our network of stations and investing in our brands.
Now let me discuss the acquisitions we made during the quarter and also provide you an update on major capital projects. 
On the acquisition front. In September, we acquired Virent Incorporated, an innovative renewable fuels and chemicals company. This acquisition supports our renewable fuel strategy of developing high-quality, low-carbon renewable feedstocks and blend stocks that can be either co-processed in our existing refineries or blended seamlessly with traditional fuels. Also, by generating valuable renewable fuels credits, we could lower our compliance costs with both the federal renewable fuel standard and California's low carbon fuel standard.
During the quarter, we closed both portions of the sale of the Alaska storage and terminalling assets to TLLP for a total consideration to Tesoro of $444 million, paid as $400 million in cash and approximately $44 million of TLLP common and general partner units.
To give you an update on our Vancouver Energy project. The energy facility Site Evaluation Council concluded adjudicated hearings in September with the filing of all parties post hearing briefs. On October 6, Vancouver Energy submitted its revised permit application to EFSEC in keeping with the council's hearing rules and regulations.
In the revised permit application, Vancouver Energy offered many conditions that are well above regulatory requirements. This includes a performance-based throughput structure by which EFSEC could limit the project's initial throughput to 180,000 barrels per day or 50% of the originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day. This structure includes the ability to incrementally increase the facility throughput by 90,000 barrels per day after 12 consecutive months of acceptable safety and environmental performance. Two consecutive performance periods would result in their originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day facility. EFSEC is now deliberating its recommendation to the Governor of Washington.
We are committed to the proposed crude oil rail to marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington in the entire West Coast.
Regarding the Los Angeles refinery integration and compliance project. The South Coast Air Quality Management district is making progress on preparing the final environmental impact report. A certified environmental impact report will allow the main permitting entities to approve the project. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and begin construction shortly thereafter.
To update you on our progress to deliver improvements in our business. You will recall that at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based on 3 things: 1, the Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; 2, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and 3, crude oil differentials that reflected the cost of transportation.
Through the first 9 months of 2016, the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel margins are in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year.
Tesoro continues to expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $400 million to $500 million. We also committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in refining, $175 million to $200 million in logistics and $25 million to $50 million in marketing. Even in the current challenging market environment, we are confident that we will deliver the $400 million to $500 million of total annual improvements to operating income.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our estimated refining and marketing improvements are trending above the range. However, estimated logistics improvements are trending slightly below the range, primarily due to the weak commodity price environment, which has impacted organic growth and volumes.
Before I conclude, I would like to remind you that we will be hosting our 2016 in Investor and Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City. My leadership team and I look forward to updating you on the company strategic outlook and outlining our plans for 2017. For additional details on this event, please follow-up with our Investor Relations team.
To conclude, we have built a strong integrated refining, logistics and marketing business and have a competitive position in our markets. This enables us to drive significant operational improvements, create sustainable earnings growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.

As we've talked before, we're in logistics business because we see substantial opportunities to continue to grow the business, both organically and through acquisition. And as you mentioned, we're in MLP because we need access to low-cost capital to do that. Over time, as we've grown the business substantially, the IDR structure does have an impact on the cost of capital of the MLP. We see that, we acknowledge it and understand it. As we look forward, it's critical because we do see continued opportunity for high return investment within the logistics business, for the MLP to have very attractive cost of capital, for our unit holders to have significant accretion opportunities as we grow the business, and for Tesoro to continue to receive cash, and MLP to be a source of cash for Tesoro to reduce our cost to capital over time. And so we absolutely view that as part of our ongoing and long-term strategy. And we'll as always continue to look at all the options that are out there to allow us to continue to both grow the business and have a low cost to capital. And on your second question about investment grade, if you look at Tesoro and TLLP's balance sheet, if you look at what we've done with cash flow and capital allocation and leverage, we think the companies are very high quality and meet most, if not all, investment-grade ratings, and think that managing cost of capital and options that are there only support that and it wouldn't take away from that."

And relative to the things that we've identified at the front-end before we closed the transaction, our people have been incredibly successful capturing those benefits. And so relative to our outlook, we're basically on target with what we thought we would do. We've done some interesting things with it. For example, in the quarter, we just completed a turnaround in Salt Lake City on the crude unit just within the last few days. And one of the things we're able to do is is we're able to take the resid from the Dickinson refinery and run it through the cat cracker in Salt Lake and make gasoline to supply the market during the downtime in the refinery which worked extremely well. And we've similarly done that by taking some of the resid to Anacortes to run through the cat cracker in Anacortes, and so the benefits -- the additional benefits in that we're seeing are working out really, really well for us. And so what we do not see anything materially different than when we first talked about it.

I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg.

I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $170 million attributable to Tesoro or $1.43 per diluted share compared to $759 million or $6.13 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated net earnings were $201 million for the third quarter compared to $799 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA was $577 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago.
Operating income in the third quarter grew year-over-year in Logistics, but was lower in refining and marketing due to a stronger than normal market environment in 2015.
Turning to our business segments. 
Refining operating income was $52 million for the third quarter compared to $899 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $204 million versus $1 billion last year. Operating income and segment EBITDA for the quarter include a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of $20 million, offset by a $14 million charge related to a contract dispute with the supplier.
The Tesoro Index was $12.45 a barrel for the third quarter, with a gross refining margin of $9.08 per barrel or 73% capture of the Tesoro Index. This compares to the Tesoro Index of $23.09 and a gross refining margin of $19.43 or 84% capture for last year. 
Refining margins in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the following 3 items: first, an overall lower refining margin environment; second, rising RINs prices. Let me remind you that our refining sales to our marketing business are based on spot prices less the full RIN costs. So in a quarter where RINs costs rise, we reflect the higher obligation in refining and the benefit from blending in our marketing segment. It is important to note that we run our business in the integrated manner. This does not have a material impact on total company results. 
And lastly, we continue to look for ways to drive improvements in our business and capital allocation. One of the ways we do this is by driving improvements in working capital. In the third quarter, we successfully reduced inventory and generated approximately $150 million in cash as a result. This inventory reduction had a positive impact on cash flow, but a negative impact on refining margins in the quarter.
Total refining throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels a day or 98% utilization, which was at the high end of our expectations.
Manufacturing costs in the third quarter increased $0.27 per barrel over the same period last year to $5.11. This year-over-year increase was largely due to the addition of the Dickinson Refinery and the Tesoro Great Plains assets acquired in 2016.
Moving to Logistics. 
Operating income increased to $133 million in the third quarter from $106 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $181 million from $153 million last year. This performance was driven by the following factors: year-over-year growth in TLLP's crude oil gathering, terminalling and transportation throughput; growth from the acquisition of the Los Angeles Storage and Pipeline Assets last year; and growth from the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets acquisition made during the quarter.
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $65 million during the third quarter. This is an increase of $27 million or 71% versus 2015.
Turning to marketing. 
Operating income was $273 million compared to $379 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $285 million compared to $390 million last year. The fuel margins were $0.149 a gallon in the third quarter versus $0.205 a gallon last year. 
During the quarter, we saw a continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions, including growth in consumer demand and an increase in vehicle miles traveled. We are pleased with our operating results in the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
Now, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and our strategic priorities for creating long-term shareholder value.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with the consolidated cash balance of $1.4 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Total debt to capitalization was 36% at the end of the quarter. Excluding TLLP debt and equity, our debt to capitalization ratio was 19%.
We have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. And we continue to progress towards our goal of obtaining investment grade credit ratings for Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics.
As you may be aware, at the end of the quarter, Tesoro entered into a new $2 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. This new 4-year cash flow credit facility replaces our $3 billion asset based credit facility. The new credit facility will become unsecured upon Tesoro achieving an investment grade rating from either Moody's or S&P. Additionally, on October 14, S&P upgraded TLLP's credit rating by 1 level to BB+, with a stable outlook. This new rating is now the same as that as Tesoro in just 1 notch below investment grade.
Turning to cash flows. 
Tesoro generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2016, including $573 million in the third quarter. 
I'd like to discuss how we continued to deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value.
First, we invest in high return capital projects and improve returns on invested capital. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $296 million in income and growth capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures were approximately $624 million. And we now expect full year 2016 capital spending of approximately $900 million. This is a reduction from our previous expectations of approximately $1 billion.
Next, we ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and also return cash to shareholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we spent approximately $412 million on accretive acquisitions. We executed $3.2 million in share repurchases for approximately $250 million, including 1.9 million shares for approximately $150 million during the quarter. We also paid dividends of $186 million and distributed $155 million to third-party LP unitholders.
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our fourth quarter outlook in our earnings release that was issued yesterday.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We are pleased with our results for the quarter, which can be attributed to our integrated business model and the continued execution of our operating improvements. 
Our operational reliability was very strong. Combined with our continued growth in Logistics and our integrated marketing business, we generated strong operating cash flows. Also, this quarter, we returned $215 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to our operations. 
Let me start with refining. As Steven mentioned previously, total refinery throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels per day or 98% utilization and gross refining margin was $9.08 per barrel. 
In our California region, we continued to see product demand growth. We operate in our refineries well with a utilization of 98%, which was at the high end of our guidance. 
In our Pacific Northwest region, throughput was higher than our expectations, but our operating performance was impacted by a lower refining margin environment, RINs pricing and products mix due to an impact of a reduction of inventory. 
In the Mid-Continent, throughput was within our expectation. However, operating results were impacted by a lower refining margin environment and a charge related to a contract settlement with a supplier. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 90% and 96%.
Moving to Logistics. 
We continued to execute on our strategy of growing this business through organic investment, strategic acquisitions and acquisitions by Tesoro. TLLP delivered strong operating income growth in the quarter. TLLP's quarter results were driven by the terminalling and transportation segment, which generated record revenues, operating income and EBITDA. During the quarter, TLLP completed the acquisition of the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets from Tesoro, and this contributed to the segment's operating performance.
Crude oil gathering volumes increased to 206,000 barrels per day versus 199,000 barrels per day last year despite a challenging commodity price environment. While this headwind still exists in our gathering and processing operations, we continue to invest in attractive organic projects, such as interconnections on the High Plains system and compression projects in our natural gas gathering system.
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire the Northern California Terminalling and Storage assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The assets could add $28 million to $33 million of annual net earnings and $45 million to $50 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its goal of $820 million of annual operating income and $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017.
Now shifting to marketing. 
Our performance in the quarter was strong. During the quarter, we saw a continued favorable trends in the market, including strong consumer demand with U.S. gasoline demand up 3% year-over-year through September, and an increase in vehicle miles traveled at 3.2% year-over-year in the U.S. and 4.8% year-over-year in California through August. Also, we increased our branded store count by 178 stations year-over-year to 2,467. We continue to successfully execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
We see continued favorable market fundamentals driven by a strong economy and growth in consumer demand in the regions in which we operate. We remain excited about the organic growth prospects in our marketing business. These include implementing improvements in our stations, expanding our network of stations and investing in our brands.
Now, let me discuss the acquisitions we made during the quarter and also provide you an update on major capital projects. 
On the acquisition front. In September, we acquired Virent, Inc., an innovative renewable fuels and chemicals company. This acquisition supports our renewable fuel strategy of developing high-quality, low-carbon renewable feedstocks and blend stocks that can be either co-processed in our existing refineries or blended seamlessly with traditional fuels. Also, by generating valuable renewable fuels credits, we could lower our compliance costs with both the federal renewable fuel standard and California's low carbon fuel standard.
During the quarter, we closed both portions of the sale of the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets to TLLP for a total consideration to Tesoro of $444 million, paid as $400 million in cash and approximately $44 million of TLLP common and general partner units.
To give you an update on our Vancouver Energy project. The energy facility Site Evaluation Council concluded adjudicated hearings in September with the filing of all parties post hearing briefs. On October 6, Vancouver Energy submitted its revised permit application to EFSEC in keeping with the council's hearing rules and regulations.
In the revised permit application, Vancouver Energy offered many conditions that are well above regulatory requirements. This includes a performance-based throughput structure by which EFSEC could limit the project's initial throughput to 180,000 barrels per day or 50% of the originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day. This structure includes the ability to incrementally increase the facility's throughput by 90,000 barrels per day after 12 consecutive months of acceptable safety and environmental performance. Two consecutive performance periods would result in their originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day facility. EFSEC is now deliberating its recommendation to the Governor of Washington.
We are committed to the proposed crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington in the entire West Coast.
Regarding the Los Angeles refinery integration and compliance project. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is making progress on preparing the final environmental impact report. A certified environmental impact report will allow the main permitting entities to approve the project. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and begin construction shortly thereafter.
To update you on our progress to deliver improvements in our business. You will recall that at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based on 3 things: one, the Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; two, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and three, crude oil differentials that reflected the cost of transportation.
Through the first 9 months of 2016, the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel margins are in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year.
Tesoro continues to expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $400 million to $500 million. We also committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in refining, $175 million to $200 million in logistics and $25 million to $50 million in marketing. Even in the current challenging market environment, we are confident that we will deliver the $400 million to $500 million of total annual improvements to operating income.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our estimated refining and marketing improvements are trending above the range. However, estimated logistics improvements are trending slightly below the range, primarily due to the weak commodity price environment, which has impacted organic growth and volumes.
Before I conclude, I would like to remind you that we will be hosting our 2016 Investor and Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City. My leadership team and I look forward to updating you on the company strategic outlook and outlining our plans for 2017. For additional details on this event, please follow up with our Investor Relations team.
To conclude, we have built a strong integrated refining, logistics and marketing business and have a competitive position in our markets. This enables us to drive significant operational improvements, create sustainable earnings growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Thank you. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator?"

As we've talked before, we're in logistics business because we see substantial opportunities to continue to grow the business, both organically and through acquisition. And as you mentioned, we're in MLP because we need access to low-cost capital to do that. Over time, as we've grown the business substantially, the IDR structure does have an impact on the cost of capital of the MLP. We see that, we acknowledge it and understand it. As we look forward, it's critical because we do see continued opportunity for high return investment within the logistics business, for the MLP to have very attractive cost of capital, for our unit holders to have significant accretion opportunities as we grow the business, and for Tesoro to continue to receive cash, and MLP to be a source of cash for Tesoro to reduce our cost of capital over time. And so we absolutely view that as part of our ongoing and long-term strategy. And we'll, as always, continue to look at all the options that are out there to allow us to continue to both grow the business and have a low cost of capital. And on your second question about investment grade, if you look at Tesoro and TLLP's balance sheet, if you look at what we've done with cash flow and capital allocation and leverage, we think the companies are very high quality and meet most, if not all, investment-grade ratings, and think that managing cost of capital and options that are there only support that and it wouldn't take away from that."

As I stated in some of the comments that I just made, we were -- we have been able to grow our wholesale marketing business through our brand stations by almost 200 stations year-on-year, which is probably a little bit ahead of what we expected to be able to do going into the year. And we've been able to drive other improvements in the business. And you're exactly right, we have looked at opportunities to acquire assets that would fit into our integrated business model. There hasn't been a lot available in the marketplace this year. And so we will continue just to evaluate opportunities as they become available. But probably more importantly, we're seeing really good growth in our underlying business, that's probably a little bit ahead of our expectations from what we thought we were able to do last year."

And we've had good success on that through our supply, sourcing and other programs like that, so with that, we're very excited about. And as the actual change from our revised guidance of $1 billion down by about 10%, primarily is some movements in our Logistics business, just more of a lesser timing impact moving things into next year and then just other small improvements across the whole system. Last year in December, that we gave guidance for 2017 that would have had Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics for a combined spending of about $1.7 billion, we are in the final stages of completing our planning for '17 and '18 and '19 as we go out and look at our plans to execute on the various projects that we're undertaking. And it looks preliminary that we'll probably be down somewhere between say 27% to 33%, somewhere in that range versus what we said last year, so down by about another $400 million to $500 million of capital spending. But we'll -- as you clearly stated, we'll be specific about that when we get together in December."

And one of the things we're able to do is we're able to take the resid from the Dickinson refinery and run it through the cat cracker in Salt Lake and make gasoline to supply the market during the downtime in the refinery, which worked out extremely well. And we've similarly done that by taking some of the resid to Anacortes to run through the cat cracker in Anacortes. And so the benefits -- the additional benefits in that we're seeing are working out really, really well for us. And so we do not see anything materially different than when we first talked about it. Now it wasn't -- it doesn't have a significant impact on the company overall, but those -- even though small little things that I talked about are very attractive to what we're trying to do. So no surprises and good execution with what we set out to do."

So that company has had, actually, very good success over time. And when Tesoro got involved in the business, within the last couple of years, we acquired an option with the potential to ultimately acquire the business, which we did during the quarter. And like I said in the brief statements that I made about Virent, we -- the ability to make the product that they're targeting is very, very well developed. There Is not a lot of uncertainty about that, so that part we feel really good about. We are working to progress that on a scale up basis, and that's very advanced to being able to scale up the production of that. And our primary interest is to be able to supply with our fuel, the renewable component of it and particularly to be able to meet some of the requirements in the state of California, and so we will continue to work on the scale up of the business.

When you think about gasoline, the value of being integrated, which is the key to us is, that we're able to, on the gasoline side, blend and get a lot of credit against that obligation. And so I don't think, on a company perspective, there is a lot of noise around that. Most companies, and us included, it's access to cellulosic and diesel, biodiesel RINs and credits where -- that's where the challenge is. And you see that mostly within the refining business as our marketing business has a lot more of its earnings tied to gasoline.

And so as we've gone through the budgeting and planning process, we've been able to go in and optimize how we spend capital, which impacts sometimes the timing, just programs that we have that we may alter the timing on. And in some cases, we've seen improvements in our ability to lower the cost in our capital programs. And then it's just the overall impact really from the major capital projects and how we will sequence those into our spend is primarily what drives the change. And we'll talk more about that when we do our investor and analyst meeting next -- in December."

I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $170 milli",1110,"Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our third quarter 2016 financial performance, and then turn the call over to Greg. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2016 net earnings from continuing operations of $170 million attributable to Tesoro or $1.43 per diluted share compared to $759 million or $6.13 per diluted share a year ago.
Consolidated net earnings were $201 million for the third quarter compared to $799 million for the same period last year, and EBITDA was $577 million compared to $1.5 billion a year ago.
Operating income in the third quarter grew year-over-year in Logistics, but was lower in refining and marketing due to a stronger than normal market environment in 2015.
Turning to our business segments. 
Refining operating income was $52 million for the third quarter compared to $899 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $204 million versus $1 billion last year. Operating income and segment EBITDA for the quarter include a pretax inventory benefit due to a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of $20 million, offset by a $14 million charge related to a contract dispute with the supplier.
The Tesoro Index was $12.45 a barrel for the third quarter, with a gross refining margin of $9.08 per barrel or 73% capture of the Tesoro Index. This compares to the Tesoro Index of $23.09 and a gross refining margin of $19.43 or 84% capture for last year. 
Refining margins in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the following 3 items: first, an overall lower refining margin environment; second, rising RINs prices. Let me remind you that our refining sales to our marketing business are based on spot prices less the full RIN costs. So in a quarter where RINs costs rise, we reflect the higher obligation in refining and the benefit from blending in our marketing segment. It is important to note that we run our business in the integrated manner. This does not have a material impact on total company results. 
And lastly, we continue to look for ways to drive improvements in our business and capital allocation. One of the ways we do this is by driving improvements in working capital. In the third quarter, we successfully reduced inventory and generated approximately $150 million in cash as a result. This inventory reduction had a positive impact on cash flow, but a negative impact on refining margins in the quarter.
Total refining throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels a day or 98% utilization, which was at the high end of our expectations.
Manufacturing costs in the third quarter increased $0.27 per barrel over the same period last year to $5.11. This year-over-year increase was largely due to the addition of the Dickinson Refinery and the Tesoro Great Plains assets acquired in 2016.
Moving to Logistics. 
Operating income increased to $133 million in the third quarter from $106 million a year ago and segment EBITDA grew to $181 million from $153 million last year. This performance was driven by the following factors: year-over-year growth in TLLP's crude oil gathering, terminalling and transportation throughput; growth from the acquisition of the Los Angeles Storage and Pipeline Assets last year; and growth from the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets acquisition made during the quarter.
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $65 million during the third quarter. This is an increase of $27 million or 71% versus 2015.
Turning to marketing. 
Operating income was $273 million compared to $379 million a year ago and segment EBITDA was $285 million compared to $390 million last year. The fuel margins were $0.149 a gallon in the third quarter versus $0.205 a gallon last year. 
During the quarter, we saw a continued strong fundamentals and favorable business conditions, including growth in consumer demand and an increase in vehicle miles traveled. We are pleased with our operating results in the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
Now, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and our strategic priorities for creating long-term shareholder value.
Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with the consolidated cash balance of $1.4 billion compared to $942 million at the end of 2015. Total debt to capitalization was 36% at the end of the quarter. Excluding TLLP debt and equity, our debt to capitalization ratio was 19%.
We have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders. And we continue to progress towards our goal of obtaining investment grade credit ratings for Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics.
As you may be aware, at the end of the quarter, Tesoro entered into a new $2 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. This new 4-year cash flow credit facility replaces our $3 billion asset based credit facility. The new credit facility will become unsecured upon Tesoro achieving an investment grade rating from either Moody's or S&P. Additionally, on October 14, S&P upgraded TLLP's credit rating by 1 level to BB+, with a stable outlook. This new rating is now the same as that as Tesoro in just 1 notch below investment grade.
Turning to cash flows. 
Tesoro generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2016, including $573 million in the third quarter. 
I'd like to discuss how we continued to deploy cash to create long-term shareholder value.
First, we invest in high return capital projects and improve returns on invested capital. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $296 million in income and growth capital projects at Tesoro and TLLP. Our combined capital expenditures were approximately $624 million. And we now expect full year 2016 capital spending of approximately $900 million. This is a reduction from our previous expectations of approximately $1 billion.
Next, we ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet to give us the flexibility to make strategic investments and also return cash to shareholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we spent approximately $412 million on accretive acquisitions. We executed $3.2 million in share repurchases for approximately $250 million, including 1.9 million shares for approximately $150 million during the quarter. We also paid dividends of $186 million and distributed $155 million to third-party LP unitholders.
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel and other elements related to our fourth quarter outlook in our earnings release that was issued yesterday.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg."

We are pleased with our results for the quarter, which can be attributed to our integrated business model and the continued execution of our operating improvements. 
Our operational reliability was very strong. Combined with our continued growth in Logistics and our integrated marketing business, we generated strong operating cash flows. Also, this quarter, we returned $215 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to our operations. 
Let me start with refining. As Steven mentioned previously, total refinery throughput for the quarter was 873,000 barrels per day or 98% utilization and gross refining margin was $9.08 per barrel. 
In our California region, we continued to see product demand growth. We operate in our refineries well with a utilization of 98%, which was at the high end of our guidance. 
In our Pacific Northwest region, throughput was higher than our expectations, but our operating performance was impacted by a lower refining margin environment, RINs pricing and products mix due to an impact of a reduction of inventory. 
In the Mid-Continent, throughput was within our expectation. However, operating results were impacted by a lower refining margin environment and a charge related to a contract settlement with a supplier. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect overall refinery utilization to be between 90% and 96%.
Moving to Logistics. 
We continued to execute on our strategy of growing this business through organic investment, strategic acquisitions and acquisitions by Tesoro. TLLP delivered strong operating income growth in the quarter. TLLP's quarter results were driven by the terminalling and transportation segment, which generated record revenues, operating income and EBITDA. During the quarter, TLLP completed the acquisition of the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets from Tesoro, and this contributed to the segment's operating performance.
Crude oil gathering volumes increased to 206,000 barrels per day versus 199,000 barrels per day last year despite a challenging commodity price environment. While this headwind still exists in our gathering and processing operations, we continue to invest in attractive organic projects, such as interconnections on the High Plains system and compression projects in our natural gas gathering system.
Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire the Northern California Terminalling and Storage assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The assets could add $28 million to $33 million of annual net earnings and $45 million to $50 million of annual EBITDA to TLLP. Looking forward, TLLP remains committed to achieving its goal of $820 million of annual operating income and $1 billion of EBITDA by 2017.
Now shifting to marketing. 
Our performance in the quarter was strong. During the quarter, we saw a continued favorable trends in the market, including strong consumer demand with U.S. gasoline demand up 3% year-over-year through September, and an increase in vehicle miles traveled at 3.2% year-over-year in the U.S. and 4.8% year-over-year in California through August. Also, we increased our branded store count by 178 stations year-over-year to 2,467. We continue to successfully execute our strategy of optimizing the placement of our refined products through the most valuable channels for market consumption.
We see continued favorable market fundamentals driven by a strong economy and growth in consumer demand in the regions in which we operate. We remain excited about the organic growth prospects in our marketing business. These include implementing improvements in our stations, expanding our network of stations and investing in our brands.
Now, let me discuss the acquisitions we made during the quarter and also provide you an update on major capital projects. 
On the acquisition front. In September, we acquired Virent, Inc., an innovative renewable fuels and chemicals company. This acquisition supports our renewable fuel strategy of developing high-quality, low-carbon renewable feedstocks and blend stocks that can be either co-processed in our existing refineries or blended seamlessly with traditional fuels. Also, by generating valuable renewable fuels credits, we could lower our compliance costs with both the federal renewable fuel standard and California's low carbon fuel standard.
During the quarter, we closed both portions of the sale of the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets to TLLP for a total consideration to Tesoro of $444 million, paid as $400 million in cash and approximately $44 million of TLLP common and general partner units.
To give you an update on our Vancouver Energy project. The energy facility Site Evaluation Council concluded adjudicated hearings in September with the filing of all parties post hearing briefs. On October 6, Vancouver Energy submitted its revised permit application to EFSEC in keeping with the council's hearing rules and regulations.
In the revised permit application, Vancouver Energy offered many conditions that are well above regulatory requirements. This includes a performance-based throughput structure by which EFSEC could limit the project's initial throughput to 180,000 barrels per day or 50% of the originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day. This structure includes the ability to incrementally increase the facility's throughput by 90,000 barrels per day after 12 consecutive months of acceptable safety and environmental performance. Two consecutive performance periods would result in their originally proposed 360,000 barrels per day facility. EFSEC is now deliberating its recommendation to the Governor of Washington.
We are committed to the proposed crude oil rail-to-marine terminal and remain confident that a thorough evaluation will demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington in the entire West Coast.
Regarding the Los Angeles refinery integration and compliance project. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is making progress on preparing the final environmental impact report. A certified environmental impact report will allow the main permitting entities to approve the project. We expect to have the necessary permits and approvals by the end of this year and begin construction shortly thereafter.
To update you on our progress to deliver improvements in our business. You will recall that at our Investor and Analyst Day last December, we laid out our expectations for 2016, which were based on 3 things: one, the Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel; two, marketing fuel margins of $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon; and three, crude oil differentials that reflected the cost of transportation.
Through the first 9 months of 2016, the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel margins are in line with our expectations. Crude oil differentials continued to be significantly narrower than our expectations. This has resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than our original expectations for this year.
Tesoro continues to expect year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $400 million to $500 million. We also committed to delivering $400 million to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 million to $250 million in refining, $175 million to $200 million in logistics and $25 million to $50 million in marketing. Even in the current challenging market environment, we are confident that we will deliver the $400 million to $500 million of total annual improvements to operating income.
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our estimated refining and marketing improvements are trending above the range. However, estimated logistics improvements are trending slightly below the range, primarily due to the weak commodity price environment, which has impacted organic growth and volumes.
Before I conclude, I would like to remind you that we will be hosting our 2016 Investor and Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City. My leadership team and I look forward to updating you on the company strategic outlook and outlining our plans for 2017. For additional details on this event, please follow up with our Investor Relations team.
To conclude, we have built a strong integrated refining, logistics and marketing business and have a competitive position in our markets. This enables us to drive significant operational improvements, create sustainable earnings growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Thank you. And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator?"

As we've talked before, we're in logistics business because we see substantial opportunities to continue to grow the business, both organically and through acquisition. And as you mentioned, we're in MLP because we need access to low-cost capital to do that. Over time, as we've grown the business substantially, the IDR structure does have an impact on the cost of capital of the MLP. We see that, we acknowledge it and understand it. As we look forward, it's critical because we do see continued opportunity for high return investment within the logistics business, for the MLP to have very attractive cost of capital, for our unit holders to have significant accretion opportunities as we grow the business, and for Tesoro to continue to receive cash, and MLP to be a source of cash for Tesoro to reduce our cost of capital over time. And so we absolutely view that as part of our ongoing and long-term strategy. And we'll, as always, continue to look at all the options that are out there to allow us to continue to both grow the business and have a low cost of capital. And on your second question about investment grade, if you look at Tesoro and TLLP's balance sheet, if you look at what we've done with cash flow and capital allocation and leverage, we think the companies are very high quality and meet most, if not all, investment-grade ratings, and think that managing cost of capital and options that are there only support that and it wouldn't take away from that."

And we've been able to drive other improvements in the business. And you're exactly right, we have looked at opportunities to acquire assets that would fit into our integrated business model.

For example, in the quarter, we just completed a turnaround in Salt Lake City on the crude unit just within -- just the last few days. And one of the things we're able to do is we're able to take the resid from the Dickinson refinery and run it through the cat cracker in Salt Lake and make gasoline to supply the market during the downtime in the refinery, which worked out extremely well. And we've similarly done that by taking some of the resid to Anacortes to run through the cat cracker in Anacortes. And so the benefits -- the additional benefits in that we're seeing are working out really, really well for us. And so we do not see anything materially different than when we first talked about it. Now it wasn't -- it doesn't have a significant impact on the company overall, but those -- even though small little things that I talked about are very attractive to what we're trying to do.
