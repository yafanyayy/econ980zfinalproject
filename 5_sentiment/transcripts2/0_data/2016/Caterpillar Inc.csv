I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance services. 
On the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO. 
Now this morning, we're going to do the call similar to what we did last October. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have it yet, the slide deck, it's available on our website at caterpillar.com, and it's with the conference call webcast link. 
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting that in the investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that certainly involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors individually or in the aggregate that could make actual results to differ materially from our projections, well, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is risk factors, and our 10-K filed last February, and it's in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release and near the front of this morning's slide deck. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's financial release. And again, that's been posted on our website at caterpillar.com. 
Okay, with that, let's get started. If I could ask you to pull out the slide deck and flip to Page 4 -- or I'm sorry, Page 3, and that's the agenda of our slide deck. I'll start this morning with a quick review of the fourth quarter and the full year of '15 and the outlook for 2016, and then I'll hand off to Doug, and he'll cover a few of the key points that we were trying to make in this morning's financial release. 
So with that, let's flip to what would be Page 4 of the bottom of the slide deck. And this is the fourth quarter 2015 results versus fourth quarter 2004 ( sic ) [ 2014 ] And you can see on here that sales and revenues are down $3.2 billion from $14.2 billion to $11 billion. That's a 23% drop. And I'll kind of talk about that 2 ways. First, about $2.7 billion of that was lower volume, selling fewer things, and most of that was lower end-user demand. About $400 million of it was related to reductions in dealer inventory. Price realization was negative in the quarter, about $124 million, and we did have a stronger dollar versus the fourth quarter of '14, which caused us our sales outside the U.S. to translate into fewer dollars, and in this case, quarter-over-quarter, a negative of about $400 million. So that's the $3.2 billion. If you look at that by segment, the biggest decline was Energy & Transportation. It was off $1.8 billion. About $8.8 billion of that was CI, construction, and about half of that, a little more than half of that, was where the dealer inventory impact was most concentrated, and then about $0.5 billion was Resource Industries. And again, that's mostly mining. So the decline was across the board, but a bit more concentration -- concentrated quarter-over-quarter in Energy & Transportation. And I think given what's happened to oil prices over the course of the past year, that's probably not a big surprise. 
Now the profit impact of those changes or that decline in sales volume was about $940 million negative. The next largest item quarter-over-quarter is restructuring cost, and they were negative $585 million. They went from $97 million in the fourth quarter a year ago to $682 million this year. And a lot of that increase is a result of the fairly significant actions that we announced last September and are in the middle of implementing right now. Costs, though, were favorable, about $461 million, and that's pretty much all in, excluding restructuring versus a year ago. So that's good news. 
Now taxes, I know it's probably a little hard to follow what's happening with taxes. It was a very low kind of all-in tax impact in both quarters. The rate this year is a little lower than last year, and we had $85 million of favorable tax items in the fourth quarter of '14 and $77 million in the fourth quarter of '15. So a little bit hard to follow, but not a massive impact quarter-over-quarter. 
If we look at the profit numbers on the table up above, all-in profit in the fourth quarter a year ago was $1.23. We actually had a loss of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of '15, and a lot of that was because of the significant restructuring costs. So the all-in change was a decline of $1.38 a share. Excluding the restructuring costs in '14, the fourth quarter was $1.35. The fourth quarter of '15 was $0.74, and we were down $0.61. We continue to report our results both with and without restructuring costs. We think it's important to help you kind of understand what's going on in the business. So that's the fourth quarter. 
Let's flip to Page 5. That's the full year. It was obviously a tough year for us in 2015. Sales were off $8.2 billion. Vast majority of that was lower sales volume, but the stronger dollar impacted the full year in kind of the same way it did the quarter. In terms of segments, Energy & Transportation was the largest decline at $3.8 billion. That was oil, rail, electric power. So fairly widespread within E&T. Construction Industries was down $2.8 billion and Resource Industries $1.4 billion. So from a profit standpoint, all in, we were $5.88 in 2014, all in, including restructuring, we dropped to $3.50 in 2015, and that's a decline of $2.38 a share. More than all of that is the decline in volume. If you take out restructuring costs, we were $6.38 in '14 and $4.64 in '15, down $1.74. And I think the story for '15 is big sales headwind, $8.2 billion, but we worked really hard on lowering costs. We took significant restructuring actions, and new restructuring actions began in the third quarter. Our costs were about $520 million favorable, and that's net of about $350 million of unfavorable cost absorption. So let me explain that a little bit. 
In 2014, sales were pretty flat with 2013, not a big change. So inventory didn't change much. It was down $400 million in '14. In '15 -- so inventory absorption wasn't a big deal in '14. In '15, inventory declined $2.5 billion. So that's $2.1 billion more than it did in 2015, and there's a pretty significant cost impact to that sizable decline in inventory. Order of magnitude, 350. And so without that, costs would have been even more favorable. 
Share count was positive to profit year-over-year, about $0.16 a share, and that's -- a lot of that is the full year impact of the significant repurchases we did in '14 and a partial year impact of the repurchases that we did in '15. Overall, bottom line, all in on tax, not much change year-over-year. So that's the full year. And if you take out the restructuring costs, I'll just mention that our decremental operating profit margins were about 20%, and we would consider that to be pretty good performance. It's better than our 25% to 30% target. 
So let's flip to the next page, Page 6. Now Page 6 is a little discussion on how we did versus our outlook. And in this case, where -- since so much has transpired over the year, we're kind of taking a long look back, how did we do versus what we told you we thought we would do a year ago right now in our year-end call for '14 and then how did we come out versus the outlook that we had in place at the end of October, the last conference call that we had, the third quarter financial release. 
And so if you look down the numbers, in January a year ago, we were expecting sales and revenues this year to be $50 billion, profit per share to be $4.60, restructuring costs to be only another $150 million, and then profit per share, excluding those restructuring costs, to be around $4.75.
Now what we actually had was sales and revenues that were $47 billion, and that's in the third column, which were $3 billion below where we thought they would be when we started the year. And I think everything that's happened with oil prices, commodities, in general, increased weakness in China, most of the sales decline that we actually had in '15, we'd anticipated in that outlook. We were down from that about $3 billion. Profit per share is lower by $1.10, and quite a bit of that is restructuring costs were a lot higher. And again, that's because we announced pretty substantial new actions in September. So excluding restructuring costs, we were at $4.64, and that's $0.11 a share shy of where our outlook was when we started the year. And I think our view would be, on a $3 billion sales decline, even given all the puts and takes, that's pretty good performance. 
Now versus the last outlook that we provided in late October of 2015, we said our outlook was going to be about $48 billion, and we kind of clarified that a little further as somewhere in the range of $47 billion and $48 billion. We were looking at profit per share of $3.70, and that included $800 million of restructuring costs. And then excluding restructuring, we were looking at $460 million. Well, what we actually did was a little worse on sales. It's been a continuing challenging environment. Profit per share was lower, and that's largely because we had more restructuring costs than we expected at the time. Excluding restructuring, we ended up the year at 4 64 . Actually, a little ahead of our outlook. Now I'd seen a few of this morning's analyst reports. And for sure, we did not have the tax extenders in our previous outlook. So that was an unanticipated benefit for us. And in several analyst reports, I think you picked that up. The flip side of that is we also have a fairly sizable charge for a legal matter in our fourth quarter. We didn't expect that either, and it really wasn't related to operations, if you will, in the quarter. And those 2 items about offset each other. So I would say, all in, despite lower sales, we did a little bit better than our outlook, and we're pretty pleased with that. 
So let's talk about 2016. A lot going on in 2016. So let's flip to Page 7. First, we'll do sales and revenue. It looks to us like another tough year. We don't really forecast -- we're not forecasting any real improvement in the overall world economy. We're not banking on commodities getting better. And as a result of that, we're looking at $40 billion to $44 billion in sales and revenues. A midpoint there is about $42 billion. Now that is about $3.5 billion below where we were thinking last October when we gave a preliminary outlook. And I think that's probably not too surprising to most of you with the continued slide in oil prices to down around $30 a share, and I would say continuing concern and worry around emerging markets, particularly China. 
So as we look at next year and what we think will happen with sales or what we're expecting, another down year for Energy & Transportation, down 10% to 15%. Now quite a bit of that decline is around timing. So we knew oil prices were coming down last year. We expected that to weaken pretty substantially in 2014, and it did. But most of that reduction was in the second half of the year. We started 2014 with a pretty sizable backlog, and we sold out the backlog for the first half of the year in Energy & Transportation, particularly in the reciprocating engines for the -- for oil customers. So if you look at Energy & Transportation, that their first half of '14, they -- or I'm sorry, the first half of '15, they were only down 6% versus the prior year. Second half of the year was down 27%. That is kind of how we thought it would play in. It's what we signaled at the beginning of the year, stronger first half, weaker second half. And now we see kind of that level of business continuing on with the recent oil and gas business out on into 2015. 
Construction Industries, we're looking at being down 5% to 10%. In Resource Industries, down another 15% to 20%. Now on Resource Industries, the bad news is that it looks like it's down another 15% to 20%. That's really a tough business in mining. Very few orders. Many of our customers are in sort of challenged financial conditions. But what I would say is sales of new equipment in that number are quite low. You never want to say never about upside and downside risk, but there's so little new equipment in there. I think it's fair to say the downward-side risk is somewhat limited. 
In terms of profit per share, we put in a table here, and this is a table that was in our financial release, so a lot of moving parts. So I thought it would help to walk through it piece by piece. So if you look at our outlook for 2016, all in, profit per share, we're looking at $3.50, and that includes restructuring costs and that includes pension changes that we are making. 
We're making a change in accounting principle. It relates to our defined benefit plans primarily. It's positive to our results about $0.50 a share. And the way you want to think about this is we're moving from an accounting method that smooths actuarial gains and losses from prior years into current year results. And we're moving from that to a method that's kind of more mark-to-market and will move closer -- will be a closer representation of what our current year costs really are. And that's favorable, about $425 million in and of itself, and that's about $0.50 a share. We also have another $400 million or so of restructuring costs in our outlook, and that's about $0.50. So all in, excluding restructuring costs, we're at $4 a share. So that's the outlook for 2016 on sales and profit. In terms of profit, the negatives are lower sales as we go into 2016 from 47 down to the midpoint would be $42 billion. So at the midpoint, that's a $5 billion profit drop, offset by considerable cost reduction. A lot of that as a result of the restructuring actions that we started to put in place by September. 
So with that, I'll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."

And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it. It was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos at sometime during the year with events around the world, a year ago today, we were expecting $50 billion in sales. We ended up at $47 billion. That $3 billion is quite a drop, but we really only reduced our profit per share outside of restructuring by $0.11. And as Mike said, there's a lot involved in that, up and down. But basically, I'm pretty pleased with cost management, the restructuring actions we took in the fourth quarter. Actually, they were more aggressive than we had planned and announced, and we took about $100 million more because of it, but that will serve us well for 2016. So our team really did a good job, and I -- it's tough to say, but I -- we're getting used to cycles here. 2009 volume at $32 billion, we doubled the company in 3 years to 2012. We're down about 30% from that now, and that will serve this team very well in the years and decades ahead as we have to go through these kind of cycles and short dates. Secondly, operationally, was one of our -- 2015 was on of our better years. One thing, and I've talked about this before, one of the proxies I used for plant management is their safety record. And when I go to plants, I look at -- for that matter, when I go to customers' job sites, it's the same thing. But it -- there's a safe environment. They tell me about it. Their numbers are good. Chances are, we're going to see high quality. We're going to see engaged employees. We're going to see a profitable plan. And safety for us hit a record level of for recordable injury frequency in 2015 at 0.6, which is really world-class, we think, for heavy manufacturing. Our market position, fifth year in a row of improvement around the world in virtually across all markets, for that matter, and most all products. And I think that goes back to saying something about the quality of our product, the quality of our design, our Tier 4 implementation as well as our dealer distribution organization, which right now is very strong. And finally, Mike mentioned it, but I would point it out again, our decremental operating profit of 20%, if you really look at that without restructuring, I think it's really 17%. And while that granted happened in the fourth quarter, but that's what we learned to do. So very happy with that, and again sets us up for '16 so well. 
Our balance sheet is strong. Put some of the data in the release this morning. We saw a lot of free cash flow, about $5.2 billion in 2015. Another great year. Certainly, we'll see another positive cash flow year this year, more than enough to cover our dividend and our CapEx. I would say that we are scrubbing CapEx very hard and taking a -- really close look at every line item. We'll get that number down below '15, and we're still working through it. And finally, our focus on use of cash, as you know, has been fairly well stated over the years. But at the moment, it's our balance sheet, our credit rating and protecting our dividend. And with the cash we have on the balance sheet, with the leverage we have today, which is the best it's ever been at this stage of the cycle, I'm going back to many, many of our downturns, we feel pretty good about that. But that's really a high priority for us today is to protect that dividend and that balance sheet. 
We did a little conference call in November around Cat Financial. We really like that business. It's strategic to us. We would not have the market position we have without Cat Financial and the loyalty with our customers. Actually, in 2015, they hit a very high market share number for what they financed. The quality of that asset portfolio is very good. Past dues actually improved a little bit from 2014. And just to emphasize that we really, at Cat Financial, only use that captive finance company to finance Caterpillar products, yellow iron -- or yellow iron inside other products -- or yellow irons is a big piece of it. We have not varied from that strategy. We won't vary from that strategy. It is so key and crucial for us to delivering our market performance around the world, and it's a really well-managed company, and it's really helping us through the cycles as well. 
Looking at 2016, tough market. I would expect bumps in the road all through the year. We've taken that outlook down to $42 billion, another drop of $5 billion, lower 10% reduction. About 30% off our peak in '12. And I expect to see, frankly commodities of all stripes and all kinds, and oil for that matter, not to move too much. It can move up or down. We'll see what happens. But we're really going into this with eyes wide open, realistic view that we're going to end up the year with what we went into it with it -- where we are in commodity markets and other economies as well. Brazil, Russia, some of the areas where have been really challenged. We're baking into this outlook, continued tough times in a lot of those markets as well. So I really am hoping that this is a very realistic look. We've got some restructuring -- more restructuring coming to us that will help. We think we're about right-sized for right now. Of course, we've got some of the restructuring that we'll be announcing as early as tomorrow, with another one -- another round that will fulfill some of the things that we talked about in September. 
I also want to talk about inventory a little bit. We think we're pretty close and really not that excessive with inventory around the world, but we probably will see a slight somewhere reduction in dealer inventory. We've actually been producing at factory rates less than retail sales for a while, and as a result, seen dealer inventory drop $1 billion in their own drop, $2.5 billion. So we've really seen a drop here in the last year, which again sets us up nicely into 2016. 
Then a little bit more restructuring. I think we are committed to that pull-through number of 25% to 30%, up or down. As I said, we're 17% to 20% in 2015. We announced at September our goal was 4,000 to 5,000 positions eliminated by the end of the year. In fact, we were slightly over 5,000 on the 1st of January. And with a few more to go. Yet early in '16, which should fulfill that program and our cost-reduction goals. 
Finally, and this is the one that's good news. I feel really good about them. I'm going to talk about it for a minute. That's our efforts around digital technology, innovation and R&D. We increased R&D slightly in 2015. We're going to hold it at about that level as long as we can in 2016. And I would just point out that we also did something similar to this in '09 and '10 at the depths of the recession. We cut R&D, but we didn't cut it to the bone. That was the one thing that we held on to as long as we could. And those efforts in research and development that we made at that time of new products have hit the marketplace in our Tier 4 interim and final products being introduced. The last of them this year, and we've seen a substantial increase in the quality of the products, the design of products and acceptance in the marketplace, not to mention the fuel economies across the board. Today, we're in the same boat, post Tier 4 with lots of powertrain development, all kinds of alternative proportion methods coming through, which will be coming out of products in '17, '18 and '19. We want to continue that because we've seen the benefits of that, and market share will see the benefits of that in the future. We're going to do all we can to hold that. So while it's a high number, and subject to cut if we have to, and we will, we're doing all we can to preserve that. And then around the digital technology space. You've seen an awful lot of utterances from us last year, information of a joint venture with a key partner, closer ties with our existing and traditional partners as well. The digital transformation is occurring, a reality, and we are going to lead this in our industry. While it's challenging and our cycle would probably -- if we had a better cycle, we probably spend more. We're doing all we can to extend our leadership in this area. What we're aiming at is quite a bit different than others. I would say we're aiming at the Internet of Caterpillar things, so that when we think about what we're doing with digital technology, what we're doing with site preparation and technology, machine guidance technology, machine health technology, it's all about our installed base of 3,000 machines -- 3 million machines and engines. Rail, construction, mining, the things we do. We have no interest in going beyond that because we want to take care of our customers as we have been doing for 90 years. We have the domain knowledge of what our customers use our machines to do. We have knowledge of our machines. Our idea is to make a ready platform, lots of sensors, across our machines and other brands, to make sure that our customer gets the most out of that construction equipment in his or her fleet. I suspect that in the next year, 2 or 5, this will be a tremendous day. We'll be talking a lot more to you at our investor meetings and so on as we get there. Just this month, we're commercializing our locomotive Internet technology. That led all of our segments, and it's now ready to go. We're in the middle stages of taking that. The construction equipment will have some of that ready midyear and a lot of it by the end of the year. But the idea here is really a lot of value creation for customers, reducing downtime and lowering owning and operating cost by predicting failures, by allowing them to take less passes across a parking lot, for example, better fuel economies and efficiencies as a result, all through this overwhelming amount of data that we can now receive, process and feed back to our customers, our dealers and even our factories in a way that we've never been able to do it before level. I have to say on this, there's been a lot been written about it. I'm really happy where we are, and our speed to market on this is un-Caterpillar-like in terms of iron development. I'm quite happy about, and that's why we've gone to outside partners. 
So Mike, I'll turn it back over to you with those comments."

We've done actually very well over the last 3, 4 years on material cost. I think we've, in combination, taken out over $1 billion. So over that time -- I mean, last year, '15, was a good chunk of that. So it's been a combination of actually lower commodity prices that helped some, but all the work we've done on Lean, resourcing, engineer value chains, our investments in R&D, our partnerships with suppliers have helped generate a pretty good chunk of that cost reduction as well. So if you relate that to our price realization, that was a net benefit for us in 2015. I mean we have continued good material cost reduction, and our pricing overall was pretty neutral. It was favorable in the first half of the year, unfavorable in the second half. As we look ahead to 2016, that will probably shift down a little bit. I think given where commodity prices are right now, we're not expecting as much benefit because we don't see another big leg down. So the material cost reduction that we have in has a bit more of a concentration on the things that we do to get it. And by the same token, price realization is tougher. And I think, in large part -- or a chunk of what's going on, particularly in construction, is we've had a stronger dollar over the course of the past year. There are translation effects of that that happened immediately. We are selling in euros in Europe, and that changes. But the competitive effects on -- in the U.S. and in countries where, say, we didn't come out to our -- competing against each other, say, whether it be Latin America or Europe, I think the impact of the stronger dollar was starting to bite a little bit. Another thing that's hurt us on price a bit, and particularly the fourth quarter, and this might be a little bit hard to follow, but actually, where we're selling product matters a bit. We have different price levels in different parts of the world. And I would tell you, if you look at construction in the fourth quarter, there was a large decline in Latin America, like 49%, I think, in CI. We tend to have better price realization there than we do in some other parts of the world, and sort of that hurt the overall kind of average price in the quarter as well. So I guess, bottom line, stronger dollar, I think, very competitive environment with volumes lower, a little bit of negative geography for us. The flip side of that is still continued good work on material costs."

We did talk a lot about sales change and not much about the profit change by segment. so here's what I would say around that. So let's just backtrack a little bit and look at 2015. What happened in 2015 to decremental. Construction had an awesome year. Decrementals in construction were 10%. So their sales were down about $2.8 billion. Their profit was down less than $300 million. And that was despite this legal charge that they got in the end of the year. So very good year on managing decrementals. Resource Industries, their decrementals were 36%. And I think that was a little over our target range and partly because despite sales going down, we spent more there on R&D. I mean it's a business that we think will be good for the long term, and we needed to spend investment money in R&D there. And in fact, we did. Energy & Transportation, they had decrementals of 24%, which I think given the mix of what was down for them, if you look at how much of their was down because of oil and gas, which tended to be above-average margin business, 24%, I think for them, is pretty good. In total for the company, and again, this is excluding restructuring, we had decrementals of about 20%. That's kind of what we've got baked into next year. I won't comment so much -- I mean, overall, 20%. I won't comment so much on ROS by segment. I mean like Resource Industries, for example. Their at or below their breakeven point right now. So the ROS number, I think, is probably less meaningful than the decremental. I think throughout the company, we're working on delivering decent decrementals and a big cost reduction that we have planned for next year, both on material cost, variable or variable costs in total and the big restructuring should help all the segments. So I'm not going to give ROS guidance, but I would say that certainly, as a company, I don't think any of our segments would be big outliers here. We'll be at or better than our kind of target decrementals."

As I can't remember the year -- several years ago, we made a change to sunset or kind of main-defined benefit plans at the end of 2019. And along the way, we've been on a path to derisk the asset, the fund balance. We've moved to more fixed incomes -- fixed income rather than equity, and that will likely continue. It's going to sunset again at the end of 2019. That doesn't completely take out volatility, but I think the combination of -- we stop adding people to that plan a long time ago. People in the plan are retiring. We're not adding people to it. It will stop at the end of '19 with a shift towards more fixed income. Probably be -- what we're thinking it would reduce the volatility somewhat, certainly won't take it away, wouldn't suggest that at all. But as more companies have moved to this method, I think when they have a year-end adjustment for this like we will at the end of this year, I think the market has done a decent job of understanding what's going on, and that it is -- what it is for what it is. So I don't think it will -- I mean our view anyway is that it's -- it wouldn't impact so much how people are viewing us, if there's a year-end adjustment. And we like the change because it better matches what's actually happening from an expense standpoint rather than spreading it over a year. So in the current year, for example, and I said this before, this is not a big, unique OTO item that's happening in the year. It's taking out losses from prior years that Were masking operating results in the current year. That's our view anyway."

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services.
On the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.
Now this morning, we're going to do the call similar to what we did last October. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have it yet, the slide deck, it's available on our website at caterpillar.com, and it's with the conference call webcast link.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting that in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that certainly involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors individually or in the aggregate that could make actual results differ materially from our projections, well, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is risk factors, and our 10-K filed last February, and it's in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release and near the front of this morning's slide deck.
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's financial release. And again, that's been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. If I could ask you to pull out the slide deck and flip to Page 4 -- or I'm sorry, Page 3, and that's the agenda of our slide deck. I'll start this morning with a quick review of the fourth quarter and the full year of '15 and the outlook for 2016, and then I'll hand off to Doug, and he'll cover a few of the key points that we were trying to make in this morning's financial release.
So with that, let's flip to what would be Page 4 at the bottom of the slide deck. And this is the fourth quarter 2015 results versus fourth quarter 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ]. And you can see on here that sales and revenues are down $3.2 billion from $14.2 billion to $11 billion. That's a 23% drop. And I'll kind of talk about that 2 ways. First, about $2.7 billion of that was lower volume, selling fewer things, and most of that was lower end-user demand. About $400 million of it was related to reductions in dealer inventory. Price realization was negative in the quarter, about $124 million, and we did have a stronger dollar versus the fourth quarter of '14, which causes our sales outside the U.S. to translate into fewer dollars. And in this case, quarter-over-quarter, negative about $400 million. So that's the $3.2 billion. If you look at that by segment, the biggest decline was Energy & Transportation. It was off $1.8 billion. About 8 -- $0.8 billion of that was CI, construction, and about half of that, a little more than half of that was where the dealer inventory impact was most concentrated, and then about $0.5 billion was Resource Industries. And again, that's mostly mining. So the decline was across the board, but a bit more concentration -- concentrated quarter-over-quarter in Energy & Transportation. And I think given what's happened to oil prices over the course of the past year, that's probably not a big surprise.
Now the profit impact of those changes or that decline in sales volume was about $940 million negative. The next largest item quarter-over-quarter is restructuring costs, and they were negative $585 million. They went from $97 million in the fourth quarter a year ago to $682 million this year. And a lot of that increase is a result of the fairly significant actions that we announced last September and are in the middle of implementing right now. Costs, though, were favorable, about $461 million, and that's pretty much all-in, excluding restructuring versus a year ago. So that's good news.
Now taxes, I know it's probably a little hard to follow what's happening with taxes. It was a very low kind of all-in tax impact in both quarters. The rate this year is a little lower than last year, and we had $85 million of favorable tax items in the fourth quarter of '14 and $77 million in the fourth quarter of '15. So a little bit hard to follow, but not a massive impact quarter-over-quarter.
If we look at the profit numbers on the table up above, all-in profit in the fourth quarter a year ago was $1.23. We actually had a loss of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of '15, and a lot of that was because of the significant restructuring costs. So the all-in change was a decline of $1.38 a share. Excluding the restructuring costs in '14, the fourth quarter was $1.35. The fourth quarter of '15 was $0.74, and we were down $0.61. We continue to report our results both with and without restructuring costs. We think it's important to help you kind of understand what's going on in the business. So that's the fourth quarter.
Let's flip to Page 5. That's the full year. It was obviously a tough year for us in 2015. Sales were off $8.2 billion. The vast majority of that was lower sales volume, but the stronger dollar impacted the full year in kind of the same way it did the quarter. In terms of segments, Energy & Transportation was the largest decliner at $3.8 billion. That was oil, rail, electric power. So fairly widespread within E&T. Construction Industries was down $2.8 billion and Resource Industries, $1.4 billion. So from a profit standpoint, all in, we were $5.88 in 2014. All in, including restructuring, we dropped to $3.50 in 2015. And that's a decline of $2.38 a share. More than all of that is the decline in volume. If you take out restructuring costs, we were $6.38 in '14 and $4.64 in '15, down $1.74. And I think the story for '15 is big sales headwind, $8.2 billion, but we worked really hard on lowering costs. We took significant restructuring actions, and new restructuring actions began in the third quarter. Our costs were about $520 million favorable, and that's net of about $350 million of unfavorable cost absorption. So let me explain that a little bit.
In 2014, sales were pretty flat with 2013, not a big change. So inventory didn't change much. It was down $400 million in '14. In '15 -- so inventory absorption wasn't a big deal in '14. In '15, inventory declined $2.5 billion. So that's $2.1 billion more than it did in 2015, and there's a pretty significant cost impact to that sizable a decline in inventory, order of magnitude, $350 million. And so without that, costs would have been even more favorable.
Share count was positive to profit year-over-year, about $0.16 a share, and that's -- a lot of that is the full year impact of the significant repurchases we did in '14 and a partial year impact of the repurchases that we did in '15. Overall, bottom line, all in on tax, not much change year-over-year. So that's the full year. And if you take out the restructuring costs, I would just mention that our decremental operating profit margins were about 20%, and we would consider that to be pretty good performance. It's better than our 25% to 30% target.
So let's flip to the next page, Page 6. Now Page 6 is a little discussion on how we did versus our outlook. And in this case, we're -- since so much transpired over the year, we're kind of taking a long look back. How did we do versus what we told you we thought we would do a year ago right now in our year-end call for '14? And then how did we come out versus the outlook that we had in place at the end of October, the last conference call that we had, the third quarter financial release?
And so if you look down the numbers, in January a year ago, we were expecting sales and revenues this year to be $50 billion, profit per share to be $4.60, restructuring costs to be only another $150 million, and then profit per share, excluding those restructuring costs, to be around $4.75.
Now what we actually had was sales and revenues that were $47 billion, and that's in the third column, which were $3 billion below where we thought they would be when we started the year. And I think everything that's happened with oil prices, commodities, in general, increased weakness in China, most of the sales decline that we actually had in '15, we'd anticipated in that outlook. We were down from that about $3 billion. Profit per share is lower by $1.10, and quite a bit of that is restructuring costs were a lot higher. And again, that's because we announced pretty substantial new actions in September. So excluding restructuring costs, we were at $4.64, and that's $0.11 a share shy of where our outlook was when we started the year. And I think our view would be, on a $3 billion sales decline, even given all the puts and takes, that's pretty good performance.
Now versus the last outlook that we provided in late October of 2015, we said our outlook was going to be about $48 billion, and we kind of clarified that a little further as somewhere in the range of $47 billion and $48 billion. We were looking at profit per share of $3.70, and that included $800 million of restructuring costs. And then excluding restructuring, we were looking at $4.60. Well, what we actually did was a little worse on sales. It's been a continuing challenging environment. Profit per share was lower, and that's largely because we had more restructuring costs than we expected at the time. Excluding restructuring, we ended up the year at $4.64. Actually, a little ahead of our outlook. Now I've seen a few of this morning's analyst reports. And for sure, we did not have the tax extenders in our previous outlook. So that was an unanticipated benefit for us. And several analyst reports, I think, have picked that up. The flip side of that is we also had a fairly sizable charge for a legal matter in our fourth quarter. We didn't expect that either, and it really wasn't related to operations, if you will, in the quarter. And those 2 items about offset each other. So I would say, all in, despite lower sales, we did a little bit better than our outlook, and we're pretty pleased with that.
So let's talk about 2016. A lot going on in 2016. So let's flip to Page 7. First, we'll do sales and revenues. It looks to us like another tough year. We don't really forecast -- we're not forecasting any real improvement in the overall world economy. We're not banking on commodities getting better. And as a result of that, we're looking at $40 billion to $44 billion in sales and revenues. A midpoint there is about $42 billion. Now that is about $3.5 billion below where we were thinking last October when we gave a preliminary outlook. And I think that's probably not too surprising to most of you with the continued slide in oil prices to down around $30 a share, and I would say continuing concern and worry around emerging markets, particularly China.
So as we look at next year and what we think will happen with sales or what we're expecting, another down year for Energy & Transportation, down 10% to 15%. Now quite a bit of that decline is around timing. So we knew oil prices were coming down last year. We expected that to weaken pretty substantially in 2014, and it did. But most of that reduction was in the second half of the year. We started 2014 with a pretty sizable backlog. And we sold out of the backlog for the first half of the year in Energy & Transportation, particularly in the reciprocating engines for the -- for oil customers. So if you looked at Energy & Transportation at their first half of '14, they -- or I'm sorry, the first half of '15, they were only down 6% versus the prior year. Second half of the year was down 27%. That is kind of how we thought it would play in. It's what we signaled at the beginning of the year, stronger first half, weaker second half. And now we see kind of that level of business continuing on with the recent oil and gas business out on into 2015.
Construction Industries, we're looking at being down 5% to 10%. In Resource Industries, down another 15% to 20%. Now on Resource Industries, the bad news is it looks like it's down another 15% to 20%. That's really a tough business in mining, very few orders. Many of our customers are in sort of challenged financial conditions. But what I would say is sales of new equipment in that number are quite low. You never want to say never about upside and downside risk, but there's so little new equipment in there. I think it's fair to say the downside risk is somewhat limited.
In terms of profit per share, we put in a table here, and this is a table that was in our financial release. There's a lot of moving parts. So I thought it would help to walk through it piece by piece. So if you look at our outlook for 2016, all in, profit per share, we're looking at $3.50, and that includes restructuring costs and that includes pension changes that we are making.
We're making a change in accounting principle. It relates to our defined benefit plans primarily. It's positive to our results about $0.50 a share. And the way you want to think about this is we're moving from an accounting method that smooths actuarial gains and losses from prior years into current year results. And we're moving from that to a method that's kind of more mark-to-market and will closer -- will be a closer representation of what our current year costs really are. And that's favorable, about $425 million in and of itself, and that's about $0.50 a share. We also have another $400 million or so of restructuring costs in our outlook, and that's about $0.50. So all-in, excluding restructuring costs, we're at $4 a share. So that's the outlook for 2016 on sales and profit. In terms of profit, the negatives are lower sales as we go into 2016 from $47 billion down to the midpoint would be $42 billion. So at the midpoint, that's a $5 billion profit drop, offset by considerable cost reduction. A lot of that as a result of the restructuring actions that we started to put in place last September.
So with that, I'll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."

And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it. It was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos sometime during the year with events around the world, a year ago today, we were expecting $50 billion in sales. We ended up at $47 billion. That $3 billion is quite a drop, but we really only reduced our profit per share outside of restructuring by $0.11. And as Mike said, there's a lot involved in that, up and down. But basically, I'm pretty pleased with cost management, the restructuring actions we took in the fourth quarter. Actually, they were more aggressive than we had planned and announced, and we took about $100 million more because of it, but that will suit us up well for 2016. So our team really did a good job, and I -- it's tough to say, but I -- we're getting used to cycles here. 2009 volume at $32 billion, we doubled the company in 3 years in 2012. We're down about 30% from that now, and that will serve this team very well in the years and decades ahead as having to go through these kind of cycles in the short dates. Secondly, operationally, was one of our -- 2015 was one of our better years. One thing, and I've talked about this before, one of the proxies I use for plant management is their safety record. And when I go to plants, I look at -- for that matter, when I go to customers' job sites, it's the same thing. But if there's a safe environment, they tell me about it, their numbers are good. Chances are, we're going to see high quality. We're going to see engaged employees. We're going to see a profitable plant. And safety for us hit a record level of -- for recordable injury frequency in 2015 at 0.6, which is really world-class, we think, for heavy manufacturing. Our market position, fifth year in a row of improvement around the world in virtually across all markets for that matter and most all products. And I think that goes back to saying something about the quality of our product, the quality of our design, our Tier 4 implementation as well as our dealer distribution organization, which right now is very strong. And then finally, Mike mentioned it, but I would point it out again, our decremental operating profit of 20%, if you really look at that without restructuring, it's really 17%. And while that granted happened in the fourth quarter, but that's what we learned to do. So very happy with that and again sets us up for '16 so well.
Our balance sheet's strong. We put some of the data in the release this morning. We saw a lot of free cash flow, about $5.2 billion in 2015, another great year. Certainly, we'll see another positive cash flow year this year, more than enough to cover our dividend and our CapEx. I would say that we are scrubbing CapEx very hard and taking a really close look at every line item. We'll get that number down below '15, and we're still working through it. And finally, our focus on use of cash, as you know, has been fairly well stated over the years. But at the moment, it's our balance sheet, our credit rating and protecting our dividend. And with the cash we have on the balance sheet, with the leverage we have today, which is the best it's ever been at this stage of a cycle going back to many, many of our downturns, we feel pretty good about that. But that's really a high priority for us today is to protect that dividend and that balance sheet.
We did a little conference call in November around Cat Financial. We really like that business. It's strategic to us. We would not have the market position we have without Cat Financial and the loyalty with our customers. Actually, in 2015, they hit a very high market share number for what they finance. The quality of that asset portfolio is very good. Past dues actually improved a little bit from 2014. And just to emphasize that we really, at Cat Financial, only use that captive finance company to finance Caterpillar products, yellow iron -- or yellow iron inside other products where yellow iron is a big piece of it. We have not varied from that strategy. We won't vary from that strategy. It is so key and crucial to us in delivering our market performance around the world. And it's a really well-managed company and really helping us through the cycles as well.
Looking at the 2016, tough market. I would expect bumps in the road all through the year. We've taken that outlook down to $42 billion, another drop of $5 billion, a little over 10% reduction. About 30% off our peak in '12. And I expect to see, frankly, commodities of all stripes and all kinds and oil for that matter not to move too much. It can move up or down. We'll see what happens. But we're really going into this with an eyes wide open, realistic view that we're going to end up the year with what we went into it with in -- where we are in commodity markets and other economies as well. Brazil, Russia, some of the areas where -- have been really challenged. We're baking into this outlook continued tough times in a lot of those markets as well. So I really am hoping that this is a very realistic look. We've got some restructuring -- more restructuring coming to us that will help. We think we're about right-sized for right now. Of course, we've got some other restructuring that we'll be announcing as early as tomorrow, with another one -- another round that will fulfill some of the things we talked about in September.
I also want to talk about inventory a little bit. We think we're pretty close and really not that excessive with inventory around the world, but we probably will see a slight similar reduction in dealer inventory. We've actually been producing at factory rates less than retail sales for a while, and we as a result seen dealer inventory drop $1 billion and our own drop $2.5 billion. So we've really seen a drop here in the last year, which again sets us up nicely into 2016.
Then a little bit more restructuring. I think we are committed to that pull-through number of 25% to 30%, up or down. As I said, we're 17% to 20% in 2015. We announced in September our goal was 4,000 to 5,000 positions eliminated by the end of the year. In fact, we were slightly over 5,000 on the 1st of January. And with a few more to go yet early in '16, which should fulfill that program and our cost-reduction goals.
Finally, and this is the one that's good news, and I feel really good about them. I'm going to talk about it for a minute. That's our efforts around digital technology, innovation and R&D. We increased R&D slightly in 2015. We're going to hold it at about that level as long as we can in 2016. And I will just point out that we also did something similar to this in '09 and '10 at the depths of the recession. We cut R&D, but we didn't cut it to the bone. That was the one thing that we held on to as long as we could. And those efforts in research and development that we made at that time on new products have hit the marketplace in our Tier 4 interim and final products being introduced, the last of them this year. And we have seen a substantial increase in the quality of the products, the design of the products and the acceptance in the marketplace, not to mention fuel economies across the board. Today, we're in the same boat post Tier 4 with lots of powertrain development, all kinds of alternative propulsion methods coming through, which will be coming out in products in '17, '18 and '19. We want to continue that because we've seen the benefits of that in market share. We'll see the benefits of that in the future. And we're going to do all we can to hold that. So while it's a high number and subject to cut if we have to, and we will, we're doing all we can to preserve that. And then around the digital technology space. You've seen an awful lot of utterances from us last year, the formation of a joint venture with a key partner, closer ties with other existing and traditional partners as well. The digital transformation is occurring, a reality, and we are going to lead this in our industry. While it's challenging and our cycle would probably -- if we had a better cycle, we'd probably spend more. We're doing all we can to extend our leadership in this area. What we are aiming at is quite a bit different than others. I would say we're aiming at the Internet of Caterpillar things so that when we think about what we're doing with digital technology, what we're doing with site preparation and technology, machine guidance technology, machine health technology, it's all about our installed base of 3,000 -- 3 million machines and engines. Rail, construction, mining, the things we do. We have no interest in going beyond that because we want to take care of our customers as we have been doing for 90 years. We have the domain knowledge of what our customers use our machines to do. We have knowledge of our machines. Our idea is to make a ready platform, lots of sensors across our machines and other brands to make sure that our customer gets the most out of that construction equipment in his or her fleet. I suspect that in the next year, 2, 5, this will be a tremendous add. We'll be talking a lot more to you about it in our investor meetings and so on as we get there. Just this month, we're commercializing our locomotive Internet technology. That led all of our segments, and it's now ready to go. We're in the middle stages of taking that to construction equipment. We'll have some of that ready mid-year and a lot of it by the end of the year. But the idea here is really a lot of value creation for customers, reducing downtime and lowering owning and operating cost by predicting failures, by allowing them to take less passes across a parking lot, for example, better fuel economies and efficiencies as a result, all through this overwhelming amount of data that we can now receive, process and feed back to our customers, our dealers and even our factories in a way that we've never been able to do it before. We have a lot to say on this. There's been a lot written about it. I'm really happy where we are, and our speed to market on this is un-Caterpillar-like in terms of our iron development. I'm quite happy about that. That's why we've gone to outside partners.
So Mike, I'll turn it back over to you with those comments."

We've done actually very well over the last 3, 4 years on material cost. I think we've, in combination, taken out over $1 billion. So over that time frame -- and last year, '15, was a good chunk of that. So it's been a combination of actually lower commodity prices have helped some, but all the work we've done on lean, resourcing, engineering value chains, our investments in R&D, our partnerships with suppliers have helped generate a pretty good chunk of that cost reduction as well. So if you relate that to our price realization, that was a net benefit for us in 2015. I mean, we had continued good material cost reduction, and our pricing overall was pretty neutral. It was favorable in the first half of the year, unfavorable in the second half. As we look ahead to 2016, that will probably shift down a little bit. I think given where commodity prices are right now, we're not expecting as much benefit because we don't see another big leg down. So the material cost reduction that we have in has a bit more of a concentration on the things that we do to get it. And by the same token, price realization is tougher. And I think, in large part or a chunk of what's going on, particularly in construction is -- and we've had a stronger dollar over the course of the past year. There are translation effects of that that happen immediately. We're selling in euros in Europe, and that changes. But the competitive effects in the U.S. and in countries where, say, we and Komatsu are competing against each other, say, whether it be Latin America or Europe, I think the impact of the stronger dollar is starting to bite a little bit. Another thing that's hurt us on price a bit, and particularly the fourth quarter, and this might be a little bit hard to follow, but actually, where we're selling product matters a bit. We have different price levels in different parts of the world. And I would tell you, if you look at construction in the fourth quarter, there was a large decline in Latin America, like 49%, I think, in CI. We tend to have better price realization there than we do in some other parts of the world and sort of that hurt the overall kind of average price in the quarter as well. So I guess, bottom line, stronger dollar, I think, very competitive environment with volumes lower, a little bit of negative geography for us. The flip side of that is still continued good work on material costs."

Once we get stable at a bottom to slightly rising turn, whenever that is, in a stable production schedule, I suspect our inventory turnover is going to be very, very acceptable and ought to help us. That's about as far as I would go with that, David, because I don't know if oil or commodities where they'll be a year from now. And I really don't want to think about that, other than inventory turnover and efficiency in the plants, our variable margins, that's what's going to get us through that."

And so we didn't talk a lot about our actions up until September, but we had taken significant restructuring action to that point. But again, in June really of 2015, we started a process internally that led to our September restructuring effort. By and large, the cost reduction we're talking about, material cost has protected R&D and our digital spend and other priorities. So we've seen a significant reduction in a lot of the support areas in terms of consolidation and efficiencies. I bring this up because sometimes we get the question, ""What are you going to do if sales continue to drop?"" And I can tell you that we're continuing to work that plan. We understand and are committed to our decremental pull-throughs. And so if sales do drop, we may have to cut both some, but we have other restructuring effort that we're continuing to look at and we'll be prepared and take action on those."

We did talk a lot about the sales change and not much about the profit change by segment. so here's what I would say around that. So let's just backtrack a little bit and look at 2015. What happened in 2015 to decrementals? Construction had an awesome year. Decrementals in construction were 10%. So their sales were down about $2.8 billion. Their profit was down less than $300 million. And that was despite this legal charge that they got at the end of the year. So very good year on managing decrementals. Resource Industries, their decrementals were 36%. And I think that, that was a little over our target range and partly because despite sales going down, we spent more there on R&D. I mean, it's a business that we think will be good for the long term, and we needed to spend investment money in R&D there. And in fact, we did. Energy & Transportation, they had decrementals of 24%, which I think given the mix of what was down for them, if you look at how much of their business was down because of oil and gas, which tended to be an above-average margin business, 24%, I think, for them, is pretty good. In total for the company, and again, this is excluding restructuring, we had decrementals of about 20%. That's kind of what we've got baked into next year. I won't comment so -- I mean, overall, 20%. I won't comment so much on ROS by segment. I mean, like Resource Industries, for example. They're at or below their breakeven point right now. So the ROS number, I think, is probably less meaningful than the decremental. And I think throughout the company, we're working on delivering decent decrementals and a big cost reduction that we have planned for next year, both on material cost, variable or variable cost in total and the big restructuring should help all the segments. So I'm not going to give ROS guidance, but I would say that certainly, as a company, and I don't think any of our segments would be big outliers here, we'll be at or better than our kind of our target decrementals."

Actually I can't remember the year -- several years ago, we made a change to sunset our kind of main defined benefit plan at the end of 2019. And along the way, we've been on a path to derisk the asset, the fund balance. We've moved to more fixed income -- fixed income rather than equity, and that will likely continue. It's going to sunset again at the end of 2019. That doesn't completely take out volatility, but I think the combination of -- we stopped adding people to that plan a long time ago. People in that plan are retiring. We're not adding people to it. It will stop at the end of '19 with a shift towards more fixed income. Probably be -- what we're thinking it would reduce the volatility somewhat. Certainly, it won't take it away, wouldn't suggest that at all. But as more companies have moved to this method, I think when they have a year-end adjustment for this, like we will at the end of this year, I think the market has done a decent job of understanding what's going on, and that it is -- what it is for what it is. So I don't think it'll -- I mean, our view anyway is that it's -- it wouldn't impact so much how people are viewing us if there's a year-end adjustment. And we like the change because it better matches what's actually happening from an expense standpoint rather than spreading it over years. So in the current year, for example, and I said this before, this is not a big, unique OTO item that's happening in the year. It's taking out losses from prior years that were masking operating results in the current year. That's our view anyway."

On the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.
Now this morning, we're going to do the call similar to what we did last October. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have it yet, the slide deck, it's available on our website at caterpillar.com, and it's with the conference call webcast link.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting that in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that certainly involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors individually or in the aggregate that could make actual results differ materially from our projections, well, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is risk factors, in our 10-K filed last February, and it's in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release and near the front of this morning's slide deck.
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's financial release. And again, that's been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. If I could ask you to pull out the slide deck and flip to Page 4 -- or I'm sorry, Page 3, and that's the agenda of our slide deck. I'll start this morning with a quick review of the fourth quarter and the full year of '15 and the outlook for 2016, and then I'll hand off to Doug, and he'll cover a few of the key points that we were trying to make in this morning's financial release.
So with that, let's flip to what would be Page 4 at the bottom of the slide deck. And this is the fourth quarter 2015 results versus fourth quarter 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ]. And you can see on here that sales and revenues are down $3.2 billion from $14.2 billion to $11 billion. That's a 23% drop. And I'll kind of talk about that in 2 ways. First, about $2.7 billion of that was lower volume, selling fewer things, and most of that was lower end-user demand. About $400 million of it was related to reductions in dealer inventory. 
Price realization was negative in the quarter about $124 million, and we did have a stronger dollar versus the fourth quarter of '14, which causes our sales outside the U.S. to translate into fewer dollars. And in this case, quarter-over-quarter, a negative about $400 million. So that's the $3.2 billion. 
If you look at that by segment, the biggest decline was Energy & Transportation. It was off $1.8 billion. About 8 -- $0.8 billion of that was CI, construction, and about half of that, a little more than half of that was where the dealer inventory impact was most concentrated, and then about $0.5 billion was Resource Industries. And again, that's mostly mining. So the decline was across the board but a bit more concentration -- concentrated quarter-over-quarter in Energy & Transportation. And I think, given what's happened to oil prices over the course of the past year, that's probably not a big surprise.
Now the profit impact of those changes or that decline in sales volume was about $940 million negative. The next-largest item quarter-over-quarter is restructuring costs, and they were negative $585 million. They went from $97 million in the fourth quarter a year ago to $682 million this year. And a lot of that increase is a result of the fairly significant actions that we announced last September and are in the middle of implementing right now. Costs, though, were favorable, about $461 million, and that's pretty much all-in, excluding restructuring versus a year ago. So that's good news.
Now taxes, I know it's probably a little hard to follow what's happening with taxes. It was a very low kind of all-in tax impact in both quarters. The rate this year is a little lower than last year, and we had $85 million of favorable tax items in the fourth quarter of '14 and $77 million in the fourth quarter of '15. So a little bit hard to follow but not a massive impact quarter-over-quarter.
If we look at the profit numbers on the table up above, all-in profit in the fourth quarter a year ago was $1.23. We actually had a loss of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of '15, and a lot of that was because of the significant restructuring costs. So the all-in change was a decline of $1.38 a share. Excluding the restructuring costs in '14, the fourth quarter was $1.35. The fourth quarter of '15 was $0.74, and we were down $0.61. We continue to report our results both with and without restructuring costs. We think it's important to help you kind of understand what's going on in the business. So that's the fourth quarter.
Let's flip to Page 5. That's the full year. It was obviously a tough year for us in 2015. Sales were off $8.2 billion. The vast majority of that was lower sales volume, but the stronger dollar impacted the full year in kind of the same way it did the quarter. In terms of segments, Energy & Transportation was the largest decliner at $3.8 billion. That was oil, rail, electric power so fairly widespread within E&T. Construction Industries was down $2.8 billion and Resource Industries, $1.4 billion. 
So from a profit standpoint, all in, we were $5.88 in 2014. All-in, including restructuring, we dropped to $3.50 in 2015. And that's a decline of $2.38 a share. More than all of that is the decline in volume. If you take out restructuring costs, we were $6.38 in '14 and $4.64 in '15, down $1.74. 
And I think the story for '15 is big sales headwind, $8.2 billion, but we worked really hard on lowering costs. We took significant restructuring actions, and new restructuring actions began in the third quarter. Our costs were about $520 million favorable, and that's net of about $350 million of unfavorable cost absorption. So let me explain that a little bit.
In 2014, sales were pretty flat with 2013, not a big change. So inventory didn't change much. It was down $400 million in '14. In -- so inventory absorption wasn't a big deal in '14. In '15, inventory declined $2.5 billion. So that's $2.1 billion more than it did in 2015, and there's a pretty significant cost impact to that sizable a decline in inventory, order of magnitude, $350 million. And so without that, costs would have been even more favorable.
Share count was positive to profit year-over-year, about $0.16 a share, and that's -- a lot of that is the full year impact of the significant repurchases we did in '14 and a partial year impact of the repurchases that we did in '15. Overall, bottom line, all-in on tax, not much change year-over-year. So that's the full year. And if you take out the restructuring costs, I would just mention that our decremental operating profit margins were about 20%, and we would consider that to be pretty good performance. It's better than our 25% to 30% target.
So let's flip to the next page, Page 6. Now Page 6 is a little discussion on how we did versus our outlook. And in this case, we're -- since so much transpired over the year, we're kind of taking a long look back. How did we do versus what we told you we thought we would do a year ago right now in our year-end call for '14? And then how did we come out versus the outlook that we had in place at the end of October, the last conference call that we had, the third quarter financial release?
And so if you look down the numbers, in January a year ago, we were expecting sales and revenues this year to be $50 billion, profit per share to be $4.60, restructuring costs to be only another $150 million, and then profit per share, excluding those restructuring costs, to be around $4.75.
Now what we actually had was sales and revenues that were $47 billion, and that's in the third column, which were $3 billion below where we thought they would be when we started the year. And I think everything that's happened with oil prices, commodities in general, increased weakness in China, most of the sales decline that we actually had in '15, we'd anticipated in that outlook. We were down from that about $3 billion. 
Profit per share is lower by $1.10, and quite a bit of that is restructuring costs were a lot higher. And again, that's because we announced pretty substantial new actions in September. So excluding restructuring costs, we were at $4.64, and that's $0.11 a share shy of where our outlook was when we started the year. And I think our view would be, on a $3 billion sales decline, even given all the puts and takes, that's pretty good performance.
Now versus the last outlook that we provided in late October of 2015, we said our outlook was going to be about $48 billion, and we kind of clarified that a little further as somewhere in the range of $47 billion and $48 billion. We were looking at profit per share of $3.70, and that included $800 million of restructuring costs. And then excluding restructuring, we were looking at $4.60. Well, what we actually did was a little worse on sales. It's been a continuing challenging environment. Profit per share was lower, and that's largely because we had more restructuring costs than we expected at the time. 
Excluding restructuring, we ended up the year at $4.64, actually, a little ahead of our outlook. Now I've seen a few of this morning's analyst reports. And for sure, we did not have the tax extenders in our previous outlook. So that was an unanticipated benefit for us. And several analyst reports, I think, have picked that up. The flip side of that is we also had a fairly sizable charge for a legal matter in our fourth quarter. We didn't expect that either, and it really wasn't related to operations, if you will, in the quarter. And those 2 items about offset each other. So I would say, all in, despite lower sales, we did a little bit better than our outlook, and we're pretty pleased with that.
So let's talk about 2016. A lot going on in 2016. So let's flip to Page 7. First, we'll do sales and revenues. It looks to us like another tough year. We don't really forecast -- we're not forecasting any real improvement in the overall world economy. We're not banking on commodities getting better. And as a result of that, we're looking at $40 billion to $44 billion in sales and revenues. A midpoint there is about $42 billion. 
Now that is about $3.5 billion below where we were thinking last October when we gave a preliminary outlook. And I think that's probably not too surprising to most of you with the continued slide in oil prices to down around $30 a share, and I would say continuing concern and worry around emerging markets, particularly China.
So as we look at next year and what we think will happen with sales or what we're expecting, another down year for Energy & Transportation, down 10% to 15%. Now quite a bit of that decline is around timing. So we knew oil prices were coming down last year. We expected that to weaken pretty substantially in 2014, and it did. But most of that reduction was in the second half of the year. We started 2014 with a pretty sizable backlog. And we sold out of the backlog for the first half of the year in Energy & Transportation, particularly in the reciprocating engines for the -- for oil customers. So if you looked at Energy & Transportation at their first half of '14, they -- or I'm sorry, the first half of '15, they were only down 6% versus the prior year. Second half of the year was down 27%. That is kind of how we thought it would play in. It's what we signaled at the beginning of the year, stronger first half, weaker second half. And now we see kind of that level of business continuing on with the recip oil and gas business out on into 2015.
Construction Industries, we're looking at being down 5% to 10%. And Resource Industries, down another 15% to 20%. Now on Resource Industries, the bad news is it looks like it's down another 15% to 20%. That's really a tough business in mining, very few orders. Many of our customers are in sort of challenged financial conditions. But what I would say is sales of new equipment in that number are quite low. You never want to say never about upside and downside risk, but there's so little new equipment in there, I think it's fair to say the downside risk is somewhat limited.
In terms of profit per share, we put in a table here, and this is the table that was in our financial release. There's a lot of moving parts. So I thought it would help to walk through it piece by piece. So if you look at our outlook for 2016, all-in, profit per share, we're looking at $3.50, and that includes restructuring cost and that includes pension changes that we are making.
We're making a change in accounting principle. It relates to our defined benefit plans primarily. It's positive to our results about $0.50 a share. And the way you want to think about this is we're moving from an accounting method that smooths actuarial gains and losses from prior years into current year results. And we're moving from that to a method that's kind of more mark-to-market and will closer -- will be a closer representation of what our current year costs really are. And that's favorable, about $425 million in and of itself, and that's about $0.50 a share. 
We also have another $400 million-or-so of restructuring costs in our outlook, and that's about $0.50. So all-in, excluding restructuring costs, we're at $4 a share. So that's the outlook for 2016 on sales and profit. In terms of profit, the negatives are lower sales as we go into 2016 from $47 billion down to the midpoint would be $42 billion. So at the midpoint, that's a $5 billion profit drop, offset by considerable cost reduction, a lot of that as a result of the restructuring actions that we started to put in place last September.
So with that, I'll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."
259378,322159738,923189,"Caterpillar Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Caterpillar Inc.","Executives","Okay. Good morning, everyone. And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it. It was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos sometime during the year",1910,"Okay. Good morning, everyone. And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it. It was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos sometime during the year with events around the world, a year ago today, we were expecting $50 billion in sales. We ended up at $47 billion. That $3 billion is quite a drop, but we really only reduced our profit per share outside of restructuring by $0.11. 
And as Mike said, there's a lot involved in that, up and down. But basically, I'm pretty pleased with cost management, the restructuring actions we took in the fourth quarter. Actually, they were more aggressive than we had planned and announced, and we took about $100 million more because of it, but that will suit us up well for 2016. So our team really did a good job, and I -- it's tough to say, but I -- we're getting used to cycles here. 
2009 volume at $32 billion, we doubled the company in 3 years in 2012. We're down about 30% from that now, and that will serve this team very well in the years and decades ahead as having to go through these kind of cycles in the short dates. 
Secondly, operationally, was one of our -- 2015 was one of our better years. One thing, and I've talked about this before, one of the proxies I use for plant management is their safety record. And when I go to plants, I look at -- for that matter, when I go to customers' job sites, it's the same thing. But if there's a safe environment, they tell me about it, and their numbers are good, chances are, we're going to see high quality; we're going to see engaged employees; and we're going to see a profitable plant. And safety for us hit a record level of -- for recordable injury frequency in 2015 at 0.6, which is really world class, we think, for heavy manufacturing. 
Our market position, fifth year in a row of improvement around the world and virtually across all markets for that matter and most all products. And I think that goes back to saying something about the quality of our product, the quality of our design, our Tier 4 implementation as well as our dealer distribution organization, which right now is very strong. 
And then finally, Mike mentioned it, but I would point it out again, our decremental operating profit of 20%, if you really look at that without restructuring, it's really 17%. And while that, granted, happened in the fourth quarter, but that's what we wanted to do. So very happy with that and again sets us up for '16 so well.
Our balance sheet's strong. We put some of the data in the release this morning. We saw a lot of free cash flow, about $5.2 billion in 2015, another great year. Certainly, we'll see another positive cash flow year this year, more than enough to cover our dividend and our CapEx. I would say that we are scrubbing CapEx very hard and taking a really close look at every line item. We'll get that number down below '15, and we're still working through it. 
And finally, our focus on use of cash, as you know, has been fairly well stated over the years. But at the moment, it's our balance sheet, our credit rating and protecting our dividend. And with the cash we have on the balance sheet, with the leverage we have today, which is the best it's ever been at this stage of a cycle going back to many, many of our downturns, we feel pretty good about that. But that's really a high priority for us today is to protect that dividend and that balance sheet.
We did a little conference call in November around Cat Financial. We really like that business. It's strategic to us. We would not have the market position we have without Cat Financial and the loyalty with our customers. Actually, in 2015, they hit a very high market share number for what they finance. The quality of that asset portfolio is very good. Past dues actually improved a little bit from 2014. And just to emphasize that we really, at Cat Financial, only use that captive finance company to finance Caterpillar products, Yellow Iron -- or Yellow Iron inside other products where Yellow Iron is a big piece of it. We have not varied from that strategy. We won't vary from that strategy. It is so key and crucial to us in delivering our market performance around the world. And it's a really well-managed company, and it really helping us through the cycles as well.
Looking at 2016. Tough market. I would expect bumps in the road all through the year. We've taken that outlook down to $42 billion, another drop of $5 billion, a little over 10% reduction. About 30% off our peak in '12. And I expect to see, frankly, commodities of all stripes and all kinds, and oil for that matter not to move too much. It can move up or down. We'll see what happens. But we're really going into this with an eyes wide open realistic view that we're going to end up the year with what we went into it with and where we are in commodity markets and other economies as well. Brazil, Russia, some of the areas where -- have been really challenged. We're baking into this outlook continued tough times in a lot of those markets as well. 
So I really am hoping that this is a very realistic look. We've got some restructuring -- more restructuring coming to us that will help. We think we're about right-sized for right now. Of course, we've got some other restructuring that we'll be announcing as early as tomorrow with another one -- another round that will fulfill some of the things we talked about in September.
I also want to talk about inventory a little bit. We think we're pretty close and really not that excessive with inventory around the world, but we probably will see a slight similar reduction in dealer inventory. We've actually been producing at factory rates less than retail sales for a while, and we've, as a result, seen dealer inventory drop $1 billion and our own drop $2.5 billion. So we've really seen a drop here in the last year, which again sets us up nicely into 2016.
Then a little bit more on restructuring, I think. We are committed to that float-through number of 25% to 30%, up or down. As I said, we're 17% to 20% in 2015. We announced in September our goal was 4,000 to 5,000 positions eliminated by the end of the year. In fact, we were slightly over 5,000 on the 1st of January. And with a few more to go yet early in '16, which should fulfill that program and our cost-reduction goals.
Finally, and this is the one that's good news and I feel really good about. I'm going to talk about it for a minute. That's our efforts around digital technology, innovation and R&D. We increased R&D slightly in 2015. We're going to hold it at about that level as long as we can in 2016. And I would just point out that we also did something similar to this in '09 and '10 at the depths of the recession. We cut R&D, but we didn't cut it to the bone. That was the one thing that we held on to as long as we could. And those efforts in research and development that we made at that time on new products have hit the marketplace in our Tier 4 interim and final products being introduced, the last of them this year. And we have seen a substantial increase in the quality of the products, the design of the products and the acceptance in the marketplace, not to mention fuel economies across the board. 
Today, we're in the same boat post-Tier 4 with lots of powertrain development, all kinds of alternative propulsion methods coming through, which will be coming out in products in '17, '18 and '19. We want to continue that because we've seen the benefits of that in market share. We'll see the benefits of that in the future. And we're going to do all we can to hold that. So while it's a high number and subject to cut if we have to, and we will, we're doing all we can to preserve that. 
And then around the digital technology space. You've seen an awful lot of utterances from us last year, formation of a joint venture with a key partner, closer ties with other existing and traditional partners as well. The digital transformation is occurring, a reality, and we are going to lead this in our industry. While it's challenging and our cycle would probably -- if we had a better cycle, we'd probably spend more. We're doing all we can to extend our leadership in this area. 
What we're aiming at is quite a bit different than others. I would say we're aiming at the Internet of Caterpillar things so that when we think about what we're doing with digital technology, what we're doing with site preparation and technology, machine guidance technology, machine health technology, it's all about our installed base of 3,000 -- 3 million machines and engines. Rail, construction, mining, the things we do. We have no interest in going beyond that because we want to take care of our customers as we have been doing for 90 years. We have the domain knowledge of what our customers use our machines to do. We have knowledge of our machines. Our idea is to make a ready platform, lots of sensors across our machines and other brands to make sure that our customer gets the most out of that construction equipment in his or her fleet. 
I suspect that in the next year, 2, 5, this will be a tremendous add. We'll be talking a lot more to you about it in our investor meetings and so on as we get there. Just this month, we're commercializing our locomotive Internet technology. That led all of our segments, and it's now ready to go. We're in the middle stages of taking that to construction equipment. We'll have some of that ready midyear and a lot of it by the end of the year. But the idea here is really a lot of value creation for customers, reducing downtime and lowering owning and operating cost by predicting failures, by allowing them to take less passes across a parking lot, for example, better fuel economies and efficiencies as a result, all through this overwhelming amount of data that we can now receive, process and feed back to our customers, our dealers and even our factories in a way that we've never been able to do it before. 
We'll have a lot to say on this. There's been a lot written about it. I'm really happy where we are, and our speed to market on this is un-Caterpillar-like in terms of our iron development. I'm quite happy about that. That's why we've gone to outside partners.
So Mike, I'll turn it back over to you with those comments."

We've done actually very well over the last 3, 4 years on material cost. I think we've, in combination, taken out over $1 billion. So over that time frame -- and last year, '15, was a good chunk of that. So it's been a combination of actually lower commodity prices have helped some, but all the work we've done on lean, resourcing, engineered value chains, our investments in R&D, our partnerships with suppliers have helped generate a pretty good chunk of that cost reduction as well. So if you relate that to our price realization, that was a net benefit for us in 2015. I mean, we had continued good material cost reduction, and our pricing overall was pretty neutral. It was favorable in the first half of the year, unfavorable in the second half. As we look ahead to 2016, that'll probably shift down a little bit. I think given where commodity prices are right now, we're not expecting as much benefit because we don't see another big leg down. So the material cost reduction that we have in has a bit more of a concentration on the things that we do to get it. And by the same token, price realization is tougher. And I think, in large part or a chunk of what's going on, particularly in construction, is -- and we've had a stronger dollar over the course of the past year. There are translation effects of that, that happen immediately. We're selling in euros in Europe, and that changes. But the competitive effects in the U.S. and in countries where, say, we and Komatsu are competing against each other, say, whether it be Latin America or Europe, I think the impact of the stronger dollar is starting to bite a little bit. Another thing that's hurt us on price a bit, and particularly the fourth quarter, and this might be a little bit hard to follow, but actually, where we're selling product matters a bit. We have different price levels in different parts of the world. And I would tell you, if you look at construction in the fourth quarter, there was a large decline in Latin America, like 49%, I think, in CI. We tend to have better price realization there than we do in some other parts of the world and sort of that hurt the overall kind of average price in the quarter as well. So I guess, bottom line, stronger dollar, I think, very competitive environment with volumes lower, a little bit of negative geography for us. The flip side of that is still continued good work on material costs."

From a profit standpoint, first quarter will have a little bit below-average sales, likely. It's the middle of winter, not really the selling season, so probably a little weaker than average. So that'll impact profits to the downside a little bit. Flip side of that is the first quarter is usually a pretty good cost quarter. So that usually helps the first quarter a little bit.

I bring this up because sometimes we get the question, ""What are you going to do if sales continue to drop?"" And I can tell you that we're continuing to work that plan. We understand and are committed to our decremental pull-throughs.

We did talk a lot about the sales change and not much about the profit change by segment. so here's what I would say around that. So let's just backtrack a little bit and look at 2015. What happened in 2015 to decrementals? Construction had an awesome year. Decrementals in construction were 10%. So their sales were down about $2.8 billion. Their profit was down less than $300 million. And that was despite this legal charge that they got at the end of the year. So very good year on managing decrementals. Resource Industries, their decrementals were 36%. And I think that, that was a little over our target range and partly because, despite sales going down, we spent more there on R&D. I mean, it's a business that we think will be good for the long term, and we needed to spend investment money in R&D there. And in fact, we did. Energy & Transportation. They had decrementals of 24%, which I think, given the mix of what was down for them, if you look at how much of their business was down because of oil and gas, which tended to be an above-average margin business, 24%, I think, for them is pretty good. In total for the company, and again, this is excluding restructuring, we had decrementals of about 20%. That's kind of what we've got baked into next year. I won't comment so -- I mean, overall, 20%. I won't comment so much on ROS by segment. I mean, like Resource Industries, for example. They're at or below their breakeven point right now. So the ROS number, I think, is probably less meaningful than the decremental. And I think throughout the company, we're working on delivering decent decrementals and a big cost reduction that we have planned for next year, both on material cost -- or variable cost in total and the big restructuring should help all the segments. So I'm not going to give ROS guidance, but I would say that, certainly as a company -- and I don't think any of our segments would be big outliers here, we'll be at or better than our kind of our target decrementals."

Actually, I can't remember the year -- several years ago, we made a change to sunset our kind of main defined benefit plan at the end of 2019. And along the way, we've been on a path to derisk the asset, the fund balance. We've moved to more fixed incomes -- fixed income rather than equity, and that'll likely continue. It's going to sunset again at the end of 2019. That doesn't completely take out volatility, but I think the combination of -- we stopped adding people to that plan a long time ago. People in that plan are retiring. We're not adding people to it. It'll stop at the end of '19 with a shift towards more fixed income. Probably be -- what we're thinking, it would reduce the volatility somewhat. Certainly, it won't take it away, wouldn't suggest that at all. But as more companies have moved to this method, I think when they have a year-end adjustment for this, like we will at the end of this year, I think the market has done a decent job of understanding what's going on, and that it is -- what it is for what it is. So I don't think it'll -- I mean, our view anyway is that it's -- it wouldn't impact so much how people are viewing us if there's a year-end adjustment. And we like the change because it better matches what's actually happening from an expense standpoint rather than spreading it over years. So in the current year, for example, and I said this before, this is not a big, unique OTO item that's happening in the year. It's taking out losses from prior years that were masking operating results in the current year. That's our view anyway."

On the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.
Now this morning, we're going to do the call similar to what we did last October. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have it yet, the slide deck, it's available on our website at caterpillar.com, and it's with the conference call webcast link.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting that in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website, and it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that certainly involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors individually or in the aggregate that could make actual results differ materially from our projections, well, that can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is risk factors in our 10-K filed last February, and it's in the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release and near the front of this morning's slide deck.
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's financial release. And again, that's been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.
Okay. With that, let's get started. If I could ask you to pull out the slide deck and flip to Page 4 -- or I'm sorry, Page 3, and that's the agenda of our slide deck. I'll start this morning with a quick review of the fourth quarter and the full year of '15 and the outlook for 2016, and then I'll hand off to Doug, and he'll cover a few of the key points that we were trying to make in this morning's financial release.
So with that, let's flip to what would be Page 4 at the bottom of the slide deck. And this is the fourth quarter 2015 results versus fourth quarter 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ]. And you can see on here that sales and revenues are down $3.2 billion from $14.2 billion to $11 billion. That's a 23% drop. And I'll kind of talk about that in 2 ways. First, about $2.7 billion of that was lower volume, selling fewer things, and most of that was lower end-user demand. About $400 million of it was related to reductions in dealer inventory. 
Price realization was negative in the quarter, about $124 million, and we did have a stronger dollar versus the fourth quarter of '14, which causes our sales outside the U.S. to translate into fewer dollars and, in this case, quarter-over-quarter, a negative of about $400 million. So that's the $3.2 billion. 
If you look at that by segment, the biggest decline was Energy & Transportation. It was off $1.8 billion. About 8 -- $0.8 billion of that was CI, construction, and about half of that -- a little more than half of that was where the dealer inventory impact was most concentrated, and then about $0.5 billion was Resource Industries, and again, that's mostly mining. So the decline was across the board but a bit more concentration -- concentrated quarter-over-quarter in Energy & Transportation. And I think, given what's happened to oil prices over the course of the past year, that's probably not a big surprise.
Now the profit impact of those changes or that decline in sales volume was about $940 million negative. The next-largest item quarter-over-quarter is restructuring costs, and they were negative $585 million. They went from $97 million in the fourth quarter a year ago to $682 million this year. And a lot of that increase is a result of the fairly significant actions that we announced last September and are in the middle of implementing right now. Costs, though, were favorable, about $461 million, and that's pretty much all-in, excluding restructuring versus a year ago. So that's good news.
Now taxes, I know it's probably a little hard to follow what's happening with taxes. It was a very low kind of all-in tax impact in both quarters. The rate this year is a little lower than last year, and we had $85 million of favorable tax items in the fourth quarter of '14 and $77 million in the fourth quarter of '15. So a little bit hard to follow but not a massive impact quarter-over-quarter.
If we look at the profit numbers on the table up above, all-in profit in the fourth quarter a year ago was $1.23. We actually had a loss of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of '15, and a lot of that was because of the significant restructuring costs. So the all-in change was a decline of $1.38 a share. Excluding the restructuring costs in '14, the fourth quarter was $1.35. The fourth quarter of '15 was $0.74, and we were down $0.61. We continue to report our results both with and without restructuring costs. We think it's important to help you kind of understand what's going on in the business. So that's the fourth quarter.
Let's flip to Page 5. That's the full year. It was obviously a tough year for us in 2015. Sales were off $8.2 billion. The vast majority of that was lower sales volume, but the stronger dollar impacted the full year in kind of the same way it did the quarter. In terms of segments, Energy & Transportation was the largest decliner at $3.8 billion. That was oil, rail, electric power so fairly widespread within E&T. Construction Industries was down $2.8 billion and Resource Industries, $1.4 billion. 
So from a profit standpoint, all in, we were $5.88 in 2014. All-in, including restructuring, we dropped to $3.50 in 2015. And that's a decline of $2.38 a share. More than all of that is the decline in volume. If you take out restructuring costs, we were $6.38 in '14 and $4.64 in '15, down $1.74. 
And I think the story for '15 is big sales headwind, $8.2 billion, but we worked really hard on lowering costs. We took significant restructuring actions, and new restructuring actions began in the third quarter. Our costs were about $520 million favorable, and that's net of about $350 million of unfavorable cost absorption. So let me explain that a little bit.
In 2014, sales were pretty flat with 2013, not a big change. So inventory didn't change much. It was down $400 million in '14. In -- so inventory absorption wasn't a big deal in '14. In '15, inventory declined $2.5 billion. So that's $2.1 billion more than it did in 2015, and there's a pretty significant cost impact to that sizable a decline in inventory, order of magnitude, $350 million. And so without that, costs would have been even more favorable.
Share count was positive to profit year-over-year, about $0.16 a share, and that's -- a lot of that is the full year impact of the significant repurchases we did in '14 and a partial year impact of the repurchases that we did in '15. Overall, bottom line, all-in on tax, not much change year-over-year. So that's the full year. And if you take out the restructuring costs, I would just mention that our decremental operating profit margins were about 20%, and we would consider that to be pretty good performance. It's better than our 25% to 30% target.
So let's flip to the next page, Page 6. Now Page 6 is a little discussion on how we did versus our outlook. And in this case, we're -- since so much transpired over the year, we're kind of taking a long look back. How did we do versus what we told you we thought we would do a year ago right now in our year-end call for '14? And then how did we come out versus the outlook that we had in place at the end of October, the last conference call that we had, the third quarter financial release?
And so if you look down the numbers, in January a year ago, we were expecting sales and revenues this year to be $50 billion, profit per share to be $4.60, restructuring costs to be only another $150 million, and then profit per share, excluding those restructuring costs, to be around $4.75.
Now what we actually had was sales and revenues that were $47 billion, and that's in the third column, which were $3 billion below where we thought they would be when we started the year. And I think everything that's happened with oil prices, commodities in general, increased weakness in China, most of the sales decline that we actually had in '15, we'd anticipated in that outlook. We were down from that about $3 billion. 
Profit per share is lower by $1.10, and quite a bit of that is restructuring costs were a lot higher. And again, that's because we announced pretty substantial new actions in September. So excluding restructuring costs, we were at $4.64, and that's $0.11 a share shy of where our outlook was when we started the year. And I think our view would be, on a $3 billion sales decline, even given all the puts and takes, that's pretty good performance.
Now versus the last outlook that we provided in late October of 2015, we said our outlook was going to be about $48 billion, and we kind of clarified that a little further as somewhere in the range of $47 billion and $48 billion. We were looking at profit per share of $3.70, and that included $800 million of restructuring costs. And then excluding restructuring, we were looking at $4.60. Well, what we actually did was a little worse on sales. It's been a continuing challenging environment. Profit per share was lower, and that's largely because we had more restructuring costs than we expected at the time. 
Excluding restructuring, we ended up the year at $4.64, actually, a little ahead of our outlook. Now I've seen a few of this morning's analyst reports. And for sure, we did not have the tax extenders in our previous outlook. So that was an unanticipated benefit for us. And several analyst reports, I think, have picked that up. The flip side of that is we also had a fairly sizable charge for a legal matter in our fourth quarter. We didn't expect that either, and it really wasn't related to operations, if you will, in the quarter. And those 2 items about offset each other. So I would say, all in, despite lower sales, we did a little bit better than our outlook, and we're pretty pleased with that.
So let's talk about 2016. A lot going on in 2016. So let's flip to Page 7. First, we'll do sales and revenues. It looks to us like another tough year. We don't really forecast -- we're not forecasting any real improvement in the overall world economy. We're not banking on commodities getting better. And as a result of that, we're looking at $40 billion to $44 billion in sales and revenues. A midpoint there is about $42 billion. 
Now that is about $3.5 billion below where we were thinking last October when we gave a preliminary outlook. And I think that's probably not too surprising to most of you with the continued slide in oil prices to down around $30 a share, and I would say continuing concern and worry around emerging markets, particularly China.
So as we look at next year and what we think will happen with sales or what we're expecting, another down year for Energy & Transportation, down 10% to 15%. Now quite a bit of that decline is around timing. So we knew oil prices were coming down last year. We expected that to weaken pretty substantially in 2014, and it did. But most of that reduction was in the second half of the year. We started 2014 with a pretty sizable backlog. And we sold out of the backlog for the first half of the year in Energy & Transportation, particularly in the reciprocating engines for the -- for oil customers. So if you looked at Energy & Transportation at their first half of '14, they -- or I'm sorry, the first half of '15, they were only down 6% versus the prior year. Second half of the year was down 27%. That is kind of how we thought it would play in. It's what we signaled at the beginning of the year, stronger first half, weaker second half. And now we see kind of that level of business continuing on with the recip oil and gas business out on into 2015.
Construction Industries, we're looking at being down 5% to 10%. And Resource Industries down another 15% to 20%. Now on Resource Industries, the bad news is it looks like it's down another 15% to 20%. That's really a tough business in mining, very few orders. Many of our customers are in sort of challenged financial conditions. But what I would say is sales of new equipment in that number are quite low. You never want to say never about upside and downside risk, but there's so little new equipment in there, I think it's fair to say the downside risk is somewhat limited.
In terms of profit per share, we put in a table here, and this is the table that was in our financial release. There's a lot of moving parts. So I thought it would help to walk through it piece by piece. So if you look at our outlook for 2016, all-in, profit per share, we're looking at $3.50, and that includes restructuring cost and that includes pension changes that we are making.
We're making a change in accounting principle. It relates to our defined benefit plans primarily. It's positive to our results about $0.50 a share. And the way you want to think about this is we're moving from an accounting method that smooths actuarial gains and losses from prior years into current year results. And we're moving from that to a method that's kind of more mark-to-market and will closer -- will be a closer representation of what our current year costs really are. And that's favorable, about $425 million in and of itself, and that's about $0.50 a share. 
We also have another $400 million-or-so of restructuring costs in our outlook, and that's about $0.50. So all-in, excluding restructuring costs, we're at $4 a share. So that's the outlook for 2016 on sales and profit. In terms of profit, the negatives are lower sales as we go into 2016 from $47 billion down to the midpoint would be $42 billion. So at the midpoint, that's a $5 billion profit drop, offset by considerable cost reduction, a lot of that as a result of the restructuring actions that we started to put in place last September.
So with that, I'll turn the floor over to Doug Oberhelman."
259378,322159738,957198,"Caterpillar Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Caterpillar Inc.","Executives","Okay. Good morning, everyone. And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it. It was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos sometime during the year",1913,"Okay. Good morning, everyone. And I do want to make a few key points as I look back on '15 and forward into '16. Mike said it. It was a very tough year, but when you think about everything that happened, the challenges, the chaos sometime during the year with events around the world, a year ago today, we were expecting $50 billion in sales. We ended up at $47 billion. That $3 billion is quite a drop, but we really only reduced our profit per share outside of restructuring by $0.11. 
And as Mike said, there's a lot involved in that, up and down. But basically, I'm pretty pleased with cost management, the restructuring actions we took in the fourth quarter. Actually, they were more aggressive than we had planned and announced, and we took about $100 million more because of it, but that will suit us up well for 2016. So our team really did a good job, and I -- it's tough to say, but I -- we're getting used to cycles here. 
2009 volume at $32 billion, we doubled the company in 3 years in 2012. We're down about 30% from that now, and that will serve this team very well in the years and decades ahead as having to go through these kind of cycles in the short dates. 
Secondly, operationally, was one of our -- 2015 was one of our better years. One thing -- and I've talked about this before, one of the proxies I use for plant management is their safety record. And when I go to plants, I look at -- for that matter, when I go to customers' job sites, it's the same thing. But if there's a safe environment, they tell me about it, and their numbers are good, chances are we're going to see high quality, we're going to see engaged employees and we're going to see a profitable plant. And safety for us hit a record level of -- for recordable injury frequency in 2015 at 0.6, which is really world class, we think, for heavy manufacturing. 
Our market position, fifth year in a row of improvement around the world and virtually across all markets for that matter and most all products. And I think that goes back to saying something about the quality of our product, the quality of our design, our Tier 4 implementation as well as our dealer distribution organization, which right now is very strong. 
And then finally, Mike mentioned it, but I would point it out again, our decremental operating profit of 20%. If you really look at that without restructuring, it's really 17%. And a lot of that, granted, happened in the fourth quarter, but that's what we wanted to do. So very happy with that and, again, sets us up for '16 so well.
Our balance sheet's strong. We put some of the data in the release this morning. We saw a lot of free cash flow, about $5.2 billion in 2015, another great year. Certainly, we'll see another positive cash flow year this year, more than enough to cover our dividend and our CapEx. I would say that we are scrubbing CapEx very hard and taking a really close look at every line item. We'll get that number down below '15, and we're still working through it. 
And finally, our focus on use of cash, as you know, has been fairly well stated over the years. But at the moment, it's our balance sheet, our credit rating and protecting our dividend. And with the cash we have on the balance sheet, with the leverage we have today, which is the best it's ever been at this stage of a cycle going back to many, many of our downturns, we feel pretty good about that. But that's really a high priority for us today is to protect that dividend and that balance sheet.
We did a little conference call in November around Cat Financial. We really like that business. It's strategic to us. We would not have the market position we have without Cat Financial and the loyalty with our customers. Actually, in 2015, they hit a very high market share number for what they finance. The quality of that asset portfolio is very good. Past dues actually improved a little bit from 2014. And just to emphasize that we really, at Cat Financial, only use that captive finance company to finance Caterpillar products, yellow iron -- or yellow iron inside other products where yellow iron is a big piece of it. We have not varied from that strategy. We won't vary from that strategy. It is so key and crucial to us in delivering our market performance around the world. And it's a really well-managed company, and it really helping us through the cycles as well.
Looking at 2016. Tough market. I would expect bumps in the road all through the year. We've taken that outlook down to $42 billion, another drop of $5 billion, a little over 10% reduction, about 30% off our peak in '12. And I expect to see, frankly, commodities of all stripes and all kinds and oil, for that matter, not to move too much. It can move up or down. We'll see what happens. But we're really going into this with an eyes wide open realistic view that we're going to end up the year with what we went into it with and where we are in commodity markets and other economies as well. Brazil, Russia, some of the areas where -- have been really challenged. We're baking into this outlook continued tough times in a lot of those markets as well. 
So I really am hoping that this is a very realistic look. We've got some restructuring -- more restructuring coming to us that will help. We think we're about right-sized for right now. Of course, we've got some other restructuring that we'll be announcing as early as tomorrow with another one -- another round that will fulfill some of the things we talked about in September.
I also want to talk about inventory a little bit. We think we're pretty close and really not that excessive with inventory around the world, but we probably will see a slight similar reduction in dealer inventory. We've actually been producing at factory rates less than retail sales for a while, and we've, as a result, seen dealer inventory drop $1 billion and our own drop $2.5 billion. So we've really seen a drop here in the last year, which, again, sets us up nicely into 2016.
Then a little bit more on restructuring, I think. We are committed to that pull-through number of 25% to 30%, up or down. As I said, we're 17% to 20% in 2015. We announced in September our goal was 4,000 to 5,000 positions eliminated by the end of the year. In fact, we were slightly over 5,000 on the 1st of January and with a few more to go yet early in '16, which should fulfill that program and our cost-reduction goals.
Finally, and this is the one that's good news and I feel really good about. I'm going to talk about it for a minute. That's our efforts around digital technology, innovation and R&D. We increased R&D slightly in 2015. We're going to hold it at about that level as long as we can in 2016. And I would just point out that we also did something similar to this in '09 and '10 at the depths of the recession. We cut R&D, but we didn't cut it to the bone. That was the one thing that we held on to as long as we could. And those efforts in research and development that we made at that time on new products have hit the marketplace in our Tier 4 interim and final products being introduced, the last of them this year. And we have seen a substantial increase in the quality of the products, the design of the products and the acceptance in the marketplace, not to mention fuel economies across the board. 
Today, we're in the same boat post-Tier 4 with lots of powertrain development, all kinds of alternative propulsion methods coming through, which will be coming out in products in '17, '18 and '19. We want to continue that because we've seen the benefits of that in market share. We'll see the benefits of that in the future. And we're going to do all we can to hold that. So while it's a high number and subject to cut if we have to, and we will, we're doing all we can to preserve that. 
And then around the digital technology space. You've seen an awful lot of utterances from us last year, formation of a joint venture with a key partner, closer ties with other existing and traditional partners as well. The digital transformation is occurring, a reality, and we are going to lead this in our industry. While it's challenging and our cycle would probably -- if we had a better cycle, we'd probably spend more. We're doing all we can to extend our leadership in this area. 
What we're aiming at is quite a bit different than others. I would say we're aiming at the Internet of Caterpillar things so that when we think about what we're doing with digital technology, what we're doing with site preparation and technology, machine guidance technology, machine health technology, it's all about our installed base of 3,000 -- 3 million machines and engines: rail, construction, mining, the things we do. We have no interest in going beyond that because we want to take care of our customers as we have been doing for 90 years. We have the domain knowledge of what our customers use our machines to do. We have knowledge of our machines. Our idea is to make a ready platform, lots of sensors across our machines and other brands to make sure that our customer gets the most out of that construction equipment in his or her fleet. 
I suspect that in the next year, 2, 5, this will be a tremendous add. We'll be talking a lot more to you about it in our investor meetings and so on as we get there. Just this month, we're commercializing our locomotive Internet technology. That led all of our segments, and it's now ready to go. We're in the middle stages of taking that to construction equipment. We'll have some of that ready midyear and a lot of it by the end of the year. But the idea here is really a lot of value creation for customers, reducing downtime and lowering owning and operating cost by predicting failures, by allowing them to take less passes across a parking lot, for example, better fuel economies and efficiencies as a result, all through this overwhelming amount of data that we can now receive, process and feed back to our customers, our dealers and even our factories in a way that we've never been able to do it before. 
We'll have a lot to say on this. There's been a lot written about it. I'm really happy where we are, and our speed to market on this is un-Caterpillar-like in terms of our iron development. I'm quite happy about that. That's why we've gone to outside partners.
So Mike, I'll turn it back over to you with those comments."

We've done actually very well over the last 3, 4 years on material cost. I think we've, in combination, taken out over $1 billion. So over that time frame -- and last year, '15, was a good chunk of that. So it's been a combination of actually lower commodity prices have helped some, but all the work we've done on lean, resourcing, engineered value chains, our investments in R&D, our partnerships with suppliers have helped generate a pretty good chunk of that cost reduction as well. So if you relate that to our price realization, that was a net benefit for us in 2015. I mean, we had continued good material cost reduction, and our pricing overall was pretty neutral. It was favorable in the first half of the year, unfavorable in the second half. As we look ahead to 2016, that'll probably shift down a little bit. I think given where commodity prices are right now, we're not expecting as much benefit because we don't see another big leg down. So the material cost reduction that we have in has a bit more of a concentration on the things that we do to get it. And by the same token, price realization is tougher. And I think, in large part or a chunk of what's going on, particularly in construction, is -- and we've had a stronger dollar over the course of the past year. There are translation effects of that, that happen immediately. We're selling in euros in Europe, and that changes. But the competitive effects in the U.S. and in countries where, say, we and Komatsu are competing against each other, say, whether it be Latin America or Europe, I think the impact of the stronger dollar is starting to bite a little bit. Another thing that's hurt us on price a bit, and particularly the fourth quarter, and this might be a little bit hard to follow, but actually, where we're selling product matters a bit. We have different price levels in different parts of the world. And I would tell you, if you look at construction in the fourth quarter, there was a large decline in Latin America, like 49%, I think, in CI. We tend to have better price realization there than we do in some other parts of the world and sort of that hurt the overall kind of average price in the quarter as well. So I guess, bottom line, stronger dollar, I think, very competitive environment with volumes lower, a little bit of negative geography for us. The flip side of that is still continued good work on material costs."

From a profit standpoint, first quarter will have a little bit below-average sales, likely. It's the middle of winter, not really the selling season, so probably a little weaker than average.

We did talk a lot about the sales change and not much about the profit change by segment. so here's what I would say around that. So let's just backtrack a little bit and look at 2015. What happened in 2015 to decrementals? Construction had an awesome year. Decrementals in construction were 10%. So their sales were down about $2.8 billion. Their profit was down less than $300 million. And that was despite this legal charge that they got at the end of the year. So very good year on managing decrementals. Resource Industries, their decrementals were 36%. And I think that was a little over our target range and partly because, despite sales going down, we spent more there on R&D. I mean, it's a business that we think will be good for the long term, and we needed to spend investment money in R&D there. And in fact, we did. Energy & Transportation. They had decrementals of 24%, which I think, given the mix of what was down for them, if you look at how much of their business was down because of oil and gas, which tended to be an above-average margin business, 24%, I think, for them is pretty good. In total for the company, and again, this is excluding restructuring, we had decrementals of about 20%. That's kind of what we've got baked into next year. I won't comment so -- I mean, overall, 20%. I won't comment so much on ROS by segment. I mean, like Resource Industries, for example. They're at or below their breakeven point right now. So the ROS number, I think, is probably less meaningful than the decremental. And I think throughout the company, we're working on delivering decent decrementals and a big cost reduction that we have planned for next year, both on material cost or variable cost in total and the big restructuring should help all the segments. So I'm not going to give ROS guidance, but I would say that, certainly as a company -- and I don't think any of our segments would be big outliers here, we'll be at or better than our kind of our target decrementals."

Actually, I can't remember the year -- several years ago, we made a change to sunset our kind of main defined benefit plan at the end of 2019.

It's going to sunset again at the end of 2019. That doesn't completely take out volatility, but I think the combination of -- we stopped adding people to that plan a long time ago. People in that plan are retiring. We're not adding people to it. It'll stop at the end of '19 with a shift towards more fixed income. Probably be -- what we're thinking, it would reduce the volatility somewhat. It certainly won't take it away, wouldn't suggest that at all. But as more companies have moved to this method, I think when they have a year-end adjustment for this, like we will at the end of this year, I think the market has done a decent job of understanding what's going on, and that it is -- what it is for what it is. So I don't think it'll -- I mean, our view anyway is that it's -- it wouldn't impact so much how people are viewing us if there's a year-end adjustment. And we like the change because it better matches what's actually happening from an expense standpoint rather than spreading it over years. So in the current year, for example, and I said this before, this is not a big, unique OTO item that's happening in the year. It's taking out losses from prior years that were masking operating results in the current year. That's our view anyway."

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's President and Finance Services. And on the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO. 
We're going to do today's call similar to what we've done the past couple of quarters. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have that slide deck in front of you, it's available on our caterpillar.com website with the conference call webcast link. Remember, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And that will be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
So if you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And certainly, this morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate could make actual results to differ materially from our projections can be found under Item 1A Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the forward-looking statements in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can be found in our financial release. And again, that's been posted on the caterpillar.com website. 
Okay. With that, let's flip to Page 3 of the presentation, which is the agenda. I'm going to walk through the first quarter and the 2016 outlook, then Doug will go over a page of key points. And then Brad and Doug and I will move to Q&A and answer your questions. 
So with that, let's move to Page 4, and this is a pretty high-level summary of sales and profit for the quarter, and the little box at the top right-hand corner of the page, I think, is an important point. First quarter is quite a bit lower than the second quarter a year ago, and I'll cover that here in the second, but it was essentially right in line with what we were expecting for the first quarter in terms of sales and profit and profit excluding restructuring costs. 
So this page then primarily covers this year versus first quarter of last year, and sales were down $3.2 billion, $1.6 billion of that was Energy & Transportation, $1 billion in construction, $0.5 billion Resource Industries. And I'll cover those in a little more detail on the next page. 
Sales volume was the primary driver of the $1.57 decline in profit per share or the decline of $1.40, excluding restructuring costs. 
Price realization contributed another $234 million, and I'll cover price realization a little bit more in the context of the outlook. 
Other income and expense was unfavorable, that's below operating profit, $194 million. Two things really in there. In the first quarter of last year, we had $120 million gain, and that was from the sale of our -- the last part of our interest in our third-party logistics business, and then the difference between currency translation and hedging was negative -- the primary reason for the rest of the $64 million. 
Restructuring costs were unfavorable, $126 million in the month. That comes after our announcement last September where we accelerated actions. And then in addition to that, in the first quarter, we recorded a large chunk of restructuring costs for our ending production of our vocational on-highway truck, and that was not considered in the outlook for. 
And then on the bright side today, we have $474 million, almost $500 million, of lower cost in the quarter. That's period costs and variable costs. And certainly, for the period cost piece, a decent chunk of that was from the restructuring actions that we've been implementing over the last few years. 
So let's move on to Page 5. This is a little more explanation on sales change. It was a pretty good magnitude, $3.2 billion, so we thought it would be a good idea to kind of go through the elements. Energy & Transportation had the most significant decline, and that was $1.6 billion. Now oil and gas and transportation made up over 80% of that. With oil and gas, and we've been saying this for the past year, we had a sizable backlog for reciprocating engines for drilling and well servicing as we ended 2014 and started into 2015, and those turned in the sales for us despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2015. So we always knew the comparables between first and first and second to second were going to be tough. That was a big piece of it. We also had a high level of locomotive sales in the first quarter of last year, and that was certainly not the case in the first quarter of this year.  So those 2 things were the bulk of the decline in Energy & Transportation. 
If we move on to construction, the single biggest reason for the decline in sales is not demand. It's change in dealer inventory. So last year, we had a much more sizable increase in dealer inventory in the first quarter, and it's not uncommon to have an increase in the first quarter as dealers stock -- choose to stock up a bit for the second quarter selling season, spring and summer, and that's more activity. But the increase this year was smaller than the increase last year, and that was about half of that decline. About 1/3 of Construction Industries decline was end-user demand, mostly North America and Latin America. The North American piece, we're actually seeing, in terms of general construction and infrastructure, decent business in North America. Much of the decline in demand in North America is in the oil patch. So the first quarter of last year, that was still going fairly strong, and we think that's a decent piece of the recent construction is lower. And as we go through the year, we ought to be lapping that because it declined as we went through last year. Latin America is down. Brazil, for example, and Mexico, are quite a bit lower. Asia, on the other hand, demand was actually up in the quarter, and that's a good thing. I'm sure Doug will talk about it in a little bit, but China was better for us. And then EAME, principally in the Africa and Middle East part of it, was [indiscernible] 
Price realization was negative $172 million. So of the $234 million for the company, $172 million of it was in construction. And again, when we get to the outlook, I'll talk a little more about that. 
In Resource Industries, we were down $0.5 billion, most all of that was volume, essentially no dealer inventory impact there, and price realization was relatively benign in terms of dollars at negative $38 million. So most of the Resource Industries is lower end-user demand. So that's a recap of the sales change. 
Let's move forward and talk about the outlook. We did trim the range for sales and revenues. We moved it from 40 -- a range of $40 billion to $44 billion to a range of $40 billion to $42 billion, so the midpoint is down about $1 billion, and that represents about 2% profit per share move from $3.50 to $3. Restructuring costs actually are up a bit from $400 million to about $550 million, and the vocational on-highway truck, our ceasing of production there, is most of the difference. And excluding the increase in restructuring costs, we're moving from $4 to $3.70 a share. There are puts and takes on costs, but the primary reason for the decline in the $4 to $3.70 is the $1 billion decline in sales at the midpoint. So that's the outlook for sales and profit. 
I thought I would take a minute and talk about the elements of the sales change. So first look, construction, really no change in our volume. I mean there are some, again, puts and takes here. China, again, is a bit better. We took the forecast up a little for that. Latin America, a little weaker than expected. Sentiment around construction, and I think Doug will talk about this in a few minutes, is a bit better. That's good. We like that, but it's a bit too soon, I think, to start playing that into the outlook. So fundamentally, the outlook for volume in Construction Industries is pretty neutral. Resource Industries, demand looks like it's going to be down again, weaker than we had expected when we started the year, even though it's already pretty low. The recent improvement in commodity prices is a good thing. We're happy that that's positive for our customers, but it's certainly not enough and it hasn't been around long enough to drive a sustained increase in demand for our product.  Now that decline in Resource Industries is about 1/4 of our decline in the outlook. So Energy & Transportation, this is where the outlook for the year came down the most. And essentially, it's for the most part transportation-related. The biggest piece of that is rail. Looks like it's going to be a tougher year for our customers in rail. They have a lot of locomoted idled, and we think some of the orders on hand are going to get moved out to a -- later than this year. Marine is  weaker. A competitor of ours announced results yesterday, and talked about the same thing, particularly around workboats that service offshore oil. We're also down a bit in transportation because of the stopping of the on-highway vocational trucks. There was sales in the forecast for that when we started the year, and that's going to ramp down fairly quickly. And the last item that affects sales and effects profit, and that's price realization. When we started the year, we were thinking negative price of maybe about 0.5%, and that's what was in our outlook. We've raised that to about 1%. And from a year-over-year standpoint, we think that, that will be mostly in the first half of the year. We saw prices trending down in the second half of last year, so the comps are particularly more difficult in the first half than they'll be in the second half. And most of that decline is going to be in Resource Industries and Construction Industries. 
In terms of the timing of the outlook. As you know, there's always some seasonality in our business. And if you look at Caterpillar over the last 20 years, about 49% of our sales usually end up in the first half of the year and about 51% end up in the second half of the year. This year, that's going to be a little bit more skewed to the second half. We're thinking maybe 47.5% or so in the first half, 52% in the second half. And that represents about $600 million more in the second half of the year than kind of our historical average would lead you to expect. I just wanted to put that in for context so you didn't think that there was some big hockey stick at the end of the year. There's not. A bigger second half is normal. Much of the reason for a little bit more skewing in the second half is rail. And we've talked about this for the last couple of years. We'll be introducing the Tier 4 locomotive in North America in the second half. And then in addition to that, our turbine business is a little bit more skewed to the second half. We've got a good backlog there. In fact, the backlog from first quarter to second quarter is about the same -- or I'm sorry, from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter is about the same. 
So now what that all means for the second quarter is that sales will be up about $0.5 billion or so from the first quarter to the second quarter. That's about $10 billion. And on that, we think profit will be just a shade less than $1 a share. 
So with that, I would like to turn the floor over to our Chairman, Doug Oberhelman."

I'll just walk down through this slide I hope you have in front of you, these 7 points I'd like to make with you and shed a little color then we'll go to Q&A as well. 
First of all, around China. I was over there about 3 weeks ago, as I usually do in March, to attend a state-sponsored forum of CEOs from Europe and United States. And there's a lot of sharing about government policy, where they're going with the 5-year plan, where they're going with the 10-year plan, for that matter as well, and a lot of discussion around the transition from an investment economy to consumer economy, and I think that's part of what we're all feeling. They also announced about the same time, or a little bit before that actually, a little bit of a stimulus, which was minor. But frankly, we're feeling that. This is the first post-Chinese New Year in probably 3 that we have seen a continued industry uplift for the industries that we serve around construction. It's not a hockey stick. It's not a boom. It's not a 2010, but it is the first time we've seen that happened, and we have lifted our schedules as a result of that for this year. We've talked about that in the release. We'll see how long that goes. This was around infrastructure, primarily high-speed rail. And a lot of it this development in the West where it's really needed, where there's a lot of very backwards places. So they recognized that, and they're working on that trying to balance I think, the infrastructure needs with what I've described, plus continued investment in airports and so on with the consumerism they're trying to drive. And that's the balance, I think, that they're trying to pull off. We'll see how it goes. So far, so good. 
In the U.S., any -- just about any market that's away from oil is doing pretty good. Southeastern U.S., Southwest U.S., we're feeling the benefit now more of housing. In fact, Construction and segments were up about 7%. That's positive. When you get around and the oil patch, there's an oversupply of everything, and that's kind of shadowing the numbers. I think, once that balances out, we'll be back to -- or be able to show a fairly anemic but stable growth. And we're looking -- I just heard about the South Carolina construction plan the other day. It's a $4 billion program they're trying to pass. There's a lot of states lining up to get those kind of things done. And then of course, the federal -- the Feds [indiscernible] comes on top of that right now. As I've said before, I think the last call, we're looking at that more into '17. But certainly, that's giving states confidence, and we're seeing more and more of that around the country. So that's building again. I'm not here to project a hockey stick by any means, but it appears to be sustainable and good news for us. Energy is, as Mike said and everybody knows, is really flat. We haven't seen any kind of a uptick in our numbers with oil at $43 or whatever it is at these rates. It's probably going to have to go well before we do see that. So we're getting through that. 
Going on the second point. Operational performance continues to be very satisfying here. I know that some of these metrics aren't ones that you all watch every day, but I do. Certainly, safety had improved again in terms of recordable injury frequency rate. Now I use that to judge how management teams are operating in our factories and our offices and wherever they're running as well as employee engagement involvement. Those numbers continue to drop. It dropped 90%-plus in the last 15 years, and they're down significantly again already in the first 3 months of 2016. Our quality metrics continue to be good. We just had some reaffirmation of that in Germany at our Big Show there and talking with our customers and our big dealer zeppelins, so I'm happy with it. Our variable margin continues pretty well, even with the absence of our big -- obviously, mining and oil business that we've -- that are high-margin contributors in the past. So all in all, operationally, our Lean efforts are -- our value chain is working. Our material cost reductions and the purchasing group is working very well and continues on the path that we have been. 
A little bit more on restructuring. We actually bumped that up a bit in the first quarter, as Mike described, for the truck. Our global workforce is down about 8,600 people. We've announced the closure and consolidation of about 15 facilities. We're on plan. About $0.5 billion in cost out, as Mike mentioned, about $375 million of that or so is period cost, which is, you would expect to see it. We will make our goals. I'm very confident this year in what we projected. It's been a tougher road, needless to say, when we take those kinds of deep actions. And we've got several more coming for the rest of the year on plan that would be included in what we announced in September. But it's working. 
A strong balance sheet is another important area for us, and we're -- we've been very focused on that for a long time. You'll recall we entered '09 with a highly leveraged balance sheet. We did buy back some shares. We reduced our debt-to-cap ratio. Today, we're sitting on about $6 billion in cash. In fact, debt to cap improved again by almost a couple of points in the first quarter. So our balance sheet is strong. Our priority is the dividend, as I've said before, and will continue to say. And that balance sheet strength is one of the reasons we're able to do that and get through this turbulent period. 
Just a quick comment on Cat Financial. Nothing really obvious to report there, continue to be very tightly controlled and managed. 80% of our customer base there have a balance less than $100,000. So it's a very diverse portfolio. Our past dues bumped up a bit in the first quarter, not to be -- or to be expected in the first quarter, kind of a seasonal thing, but less than last year. So I think all the external and internal metrics we look at point to that business continuing on the path it's been, which is a real strength for us. 
And then finally, a couple of things on the future. We have maintained R&D. And that's one that has been paying off well for us. We did not cut R&D to the bone as we might have in earlier cycles in '09, and that's paying off for us now in terms of the product that's out there. We invested about $2 billion the last 3 years. Those products will come to market in the next 2 to 5 years. And I can tell you what I've seen that it will be outstanding additions to our fleet and really be nice payout. So to the extent we can, we're going to hold R&D and cut everywhere else. 
Our Lean efforts are working. Three years, over $1 billion of cost reduction through our variable costs on how we're going about that. Inventory improvement, it's down about $6 billion since 2012 as well. We've seen a big cultural change across our factories, and some of that's been demonstrated by safety, of course. 
Then lastly, I'd focus on digital, and I know some of you were at Bouma in Germany and we showed -- we've just started to scratch the surface of that by introducing the age of smart iron. We intend to be the leader here in terms of asset management, product health, productivity, safety, sustainability and predictive analytics, which is coming, will be a cornerstone of our Con Expo display next March in Las Vegas. Today, we've got 400,000 connected assets and growing. By this summer, every one of our machines will come off the line being able to be connected and provide some kind of feedback and operational productivity to the owner, to the dealer and to us, where improvements on the road, the idea being to get to a point where we can show the customer on his iPhone everything going on with his machine, his fleet, its health, its run rate, its productivity and so on. And so we'll be very close to that. We've got over 100 customers on experimental basis with that right now, several dealers participating and a lot of pull from the marketplace for this, which is quite exciting. 
So I think, Mike, I'll stop there. And we can move into Q&A, and then we can embellish as we need to as we go forward. Thank you."

As a part of our restructuring cost last year, we had a fair bit of employee-related costs. And that was, for the most part, paid in January. So there was, I think, about $400 million of extra negative cash flow in the first quarter that was related to the restructuring actions from last year. So that was a bit of a drag. And then of course, in the first quarter, we always pay. We accrue incentive compensation throughout the year, but it gets paid in the first quarter. And that was, I think, $600 million. So between the 2, we had close to $1 billion drag on operating cash flow in the quarter. So I think you'll see that improve. Operating cash flow ought to improve quite a bit from first quarter levels as we go through the rest of the year.

It goes into Marine. It goes into providing power for drill rig or a frac pump. So it's actually spread across a number of industries. I mean we worked on the cost structure.

When we made the announcement last year in September about these restructuring actions, we were thinking maybe 20 facilities would be impacted. We've announced about 15-plus now this -- on-highway vocational truck. So at least in terms of numbers of facilities, I think we're pretty far down that path. There's still more to go. And certainly, it will take a little -- even for the ones that we've announced, these phase-in, it takes a while to shut down and change and shed the cost. So we still, from a selling standpoint, we still have quite a bit to go. So that's a positive. On the incrementals, I think low 20s is too small a number. Normally, we think of incrementals as around 25. I think based on all the actions that we've done, when recovery starts, Doug has been probably the most vocal in saying this, and I believe it, too, we should probably do a bit better than that when things turn around because we certainly have plenty of capacity right now for most of our products and a period fixed cost structure that could handle a bit more."

But at the same time, the stories were much more positive that even France, in an election year there, is stimulating a bit infrastructure. And some of those big projects, we're feeding. And thus, our big dealer there was feeling better. So I would say that albeit a very small bit of optimism is in order in Europe, but I've been there now the last 2 years. I said about a year ago that Europe was 2 years behind the United States. I still believe that. So it's a very, very slow crawl out. I don't see much negativism there right now. I'd say the downside is continued -- the continued disappointment around oil and energy. I think that could go a while. I do think that our numbers are at a point where it's hard to go from -- yes, from 2 to 1 is 100% drop, but it's not a material amount of impact on us, but we saw some of that in the first quarter in resource. So we're getting near the bottom in all that just because there's -- we're at the bottom. But the downside would be -- and any big downside is going to be something we all don't see coming.

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And on the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO. 
We're going to do today's call similar to what we've done the past couple of quarters. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have that slide deck in front of you, it's available on our caterpillar.com website with the conference call webcast link. Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And that will be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
So if you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And certainly this morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found under Item 1A Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the forward-looking statements in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can be found in our financial release. And again, that's been posted on the caterpillar.com website. 
Okay. With that, let's flip to Page 3 of the presentation, which is the agenda. I'm going to walk through the first quarter and the 2016 outlook, then Doug will go over a page of key points. And then Brad and Doug and I will move to Q&A and answer your questions. 
So with that, let's move to Page 4, and this is a pretty high-level summary of sales and profit for the quarter. And then the little box at the top right-hand corner of the page, I think, is an important point. First quarter is quite a bit lower than the second quarter a year ago, and I'll cover that here in a second. But it was essentially right in line with what we were expecting for the first quarter in terms of sales and profit and profit, excluding restructuring costs. 
So this page then primarily covers this year versus first quarter of last year, and sales were down $3.2 billion. $1.6 billion of that was Energy & Transportation, $1 billion in Construction, $0.5 billion in Resource Industries. And I'll cover those in a little more detail on the next page. 
Sales volume was the primary driver of the $1.57 decline in profit per share or a decline of $1.40, excluding restructuring costs. 
Price realization contributed another $234 million, and I'll cover price realization a little bit more in the context of the outlook. 
Other income and expense was unfavorable. That's below operating profit, $194 million. Two things really in there. In the first quarter of last year, we had $120 million gain, and that was from the sale of our -- the last part of our interest in our third-party logistics business. And then the difference between currency translation and hedging was negative, the primary reason for the rest of the $64 million. 
Restructuring costs were unfavorable, $126 million in the month. That comes after our announcement last September where we accelerated actions. And then in addition to that, in the first quarter, we recorded a large chunk of restructuring costs for our ending production of our vocational on-highway truck, and that was not considered in the outlook for. 
And then on the bright side today, we have $474 million, almost $500 million, of lower costs in the quarter. That's period cost and variable cost. And certainly, for the period cost piece, a decent chunk of that was from the restructuring actions that we've been implementing over the last few years. 
So let's move on to Page 5. This is a little more explanation on sales change. It was a pretty good magnitude, $3.2 billion, so we thought it would be a good idea to kind of go through the elements. Energy & Transportation had the most significant decline, and that was $1.6 billion. Now oil and gas and transportation made up over 80% of that. 
With oil and gas, and we've been saying this for the past year, we had a sizable backlog for reciprocating engines for drilling and well servicing as we ended 2014 and started into 2015. And those turned into sales for us despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2015. So we always knew the comparables between first and first and second to second were going to be tough. That was a big piece of it. We also had a high level of locomotive sales in the first quarter of last year, and that was certainly not the case in the first quarter of this year.  So those 2 things were the bulk of the decline in Energy & Transportation. 
If we move on to Construction, the single biggest reason for the decline in sales is not demand. It's change in dealer inventory. So last year, we had a much more sizable increase in dealer inventory in the first quarter, and it's not uncommon to have an increase in the first quarter as dealers stock -- choose to stock up a bit for the second quarter selling season, spring and summer, and that's more activity. But the increase this year was smaller than the increase last year, and that was about half of that decline. About 1/3 of Construction Industries' decline was end-user demand, mostly North America and Latin America. The North American piece, we're actually seeing, in terms of general construction and infrastructure, decent business in North America. Much of the decline in demand in North America is in the oil patch. So the first quarter of last year, that was still going fairly strong, and we think that's a decent piece of the reason Construction is lower. And as we go through the year, we ought to be lapping that because it declined as we went through last year. Latin America is down. Brazil, for example, and Mexico are quite a bit lower. Asia, on the other hand, demand was actually up in the quarter, and that's a good thing. I'm sure Doug will talk about it in a little bit, but China was better for us. And then EAME, principally in the Africa and Middle East part of it, was down slightly. Price realization was negative $172 million. So of the $234 million for the company, $172 million of it was in Construction. And again, when we get to the outlook, I'll talk a little more about that. 
In Resource Industries, we were down $0.5 billion, most all of that was volume. Essentially no dealer inventory impact there, and price realization was relatively benign in terms of dollars, negative $38 million. So most of the Resource Industries is lower end-user demand. So that's a recap of the sales change. 
Let's move forward and talk about the outlook. We did trim the range for sales and revenues. We moved it from -- a range of $40 billion to $44 billion to a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So the midpoint is down about $1 billion, and that represents about 2% profit per share move from $3.50 to $3. Restructuring costs actually are up a bit from $400 million to about $550 million, and the vocational on-highway truck, our ceasing of production there is most of that difference. And excluding the increase in restructuring costs, we're moving from $4 to $3.70 a share. There are puts and takes on costs, but the primary reason for the decline in the $4 to $3.70 is the $1 billion decline in sales at the midpoint. So that's the outlook for sales and profit. 
I thought I would take a minute and talk about the elements of the sales change. So first with Construction, really no change in our volume. I mean, there are some, again, puts and takes here. China, again, is a bit better. We took the forecast up a little for that. Latin America, a little weaker than expected. Sentiment around Construction, and I think Doug will talk about this in a few minutes, is a bit better. That's good. We like that, but it's a bit too soon, I think, to start playing that into the outlook. So fundamentally, the outlook for volume in Construction Industries is pretty neutral. 
Resource Industries. Demand looks like it's going to be down again, weaker than we had expected when we started the year, even though it's already pretty low. The recent improvement in commodity prices is a good thing. We're happy that that's positive for our customers, but it's certainly not enough and it hasn't been around long enough to drive a sustained increase in demand for our product.  Now that decline in Resource Industries is about 1/4 of our decline in the outlook. 
So Energy & Transportation, this is where the outlook for the year came down the most. And essentially, it's -- for the most part transportation-related. The biggest piece of that is rail. Looks like it's going to be a tougher year for our customers in rail. They have a lot of locomotives idled, and we think some of the orders on hand are going to get moved out to a -- later than this year. Marine is  weaker. A competitor of ours announced results yesterday, and they talked about the same thing, particularly around workboats that service offshore oil. We're also down a bit in transportation because of the stopping of the on-highway vocational trucks. There was sales in the forecast for that when we started the year, and that's going to ramp down fairly quickly. 
And the last item that affects sales and it affects profit, and that's price realization. When we started the year, we were thinking negative price of maybe about 0.5%, and that's what was in our outlook. We've raised that to about 1%. And from a year-over-year standpoint, we think that, that will be mostly in the first half of the year. We saw prices trending down in the second half of last year, so the comps are particularly more difficult in the first half than they'll be in the second half. And most of that decline is going to be in Resource Industries and Construction Industries. 
In terms of the timing of the outlook. As you know, there's always some seasonality in our business. And if you look at Caterpillar over the last 20 years, about 49% of our sales usually end up in the first half of the year, and about 51% end up in the second half of the year. This year, that's going to be a little bit more skewed to the second half. We're thinking maybe 47.5% or so in the first half, 52% in the second half. And that represents about $600 million more in the second half of the year than kind of our historical average would lead you to expect. I just wanted to put that in for context so you didn't think that there was some big hockey stick at the end of the year. There is not. A bigger second half is normal. Much of the reason for a little bit more skewing in the second half is rail. And we've talked about this for the last couple of years. We'll be introducing the Tier 4 locomotive in North America in the second half. And then in addition to that, our turbine business is a little bit more skewed to the second half. We've got a good backlog there. In fact, the backlog from first quarter to second quarter was about the same -- or I'm sorry, from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter was about the same. 
So now what that all means for the second quarter is that sales will be up about $0.5 billion or so from the first quarter to the second quarter. That's about $10 billion. And on that, we think profit will be just a shade less than $1 a share. 
So with that, I would like to turn the floor over to our Chairman, Doug Oberhelman."

First of all, around China. I was over there about 3 weeks ago, as I usually do in March, to attend a state-sponsored forum of CEOs from Europe and United States. And there's a lot of sharing about government policy, where they're going with the 5-year plan, where they're going with the 10-year plan, for that matter as well, and a lot of discussion around the transition from an investment economy and consumer economy, and I think that's part of what we're all feeling. They also announced about the same time, or a little bit before that actually, a little bit of a stimulus, which was minor, and frankly, we're feeling that. This is the first post-Chinese New Year in probably 3 that we have seen a continued industry uplift for the industries that we serve around construction. It's not a hockey stick. It's not a boom. It's not a 2010, but it is the first time we've seen that happened, and we have lifted our schedules as a result of that for this year. We've talked about that in the release. We'll see how long that goes. This is around infrastructure, primarily high-speed rail. And a lot of it is development in the West, where it's really needed, where there's a lot of very backwards places. So they recognized that, and they're working on that, trying to balance, I think, the infrastructure needs with what I described, plus continued investment in airports and so on with the consumerism they're trying to drive. And that's the balance they're -- I think they're trying to pull off. We'll see how it goes. So far, so good. 
In the U.S., any -- just about any market that's away from oil is doing pretty good. Southeastern U.S., Southwest U.S., we're feeling the benefit now more of housing. In fact, construction and paving segments were up about 7%. That's positive. When you get around the oil patch, there's oversupply of everything, and that's kind of shadowing the numbers. I think once that balances out, we'll be back to -- or be able to show a fairly anemic but stable growth. And we're looking -- I just heard about the South Carolina infrastructure plan the other day. It's a $4 billion program they're trying to pass. There's a lot of states lining up to get those kind of things done. And then of course, the federal -- the FAST Act comes in on top of that right now. And as I've said before, I think the last call, we're looking at that more into '17. But certainly, that's giving states confidence, and we're seeing more and more of that around the country. So that's building again. I'm not here to project a hockey stick by any means, but it's -- appears to be sustainable and good news for us. Energy is, as Mike said and everybody knows, is really flat. We haven't seen any kind of uptick in our numbers with oil at $43 or whatever it is that these rates. It's probably going to have to go awhile before we do see that. So we're getting through that. 
Going on to the second point. Operational performance continues to be very satisfying here. I know that some of these metrics aren't ones you all watch every day, but I do. Certainly, safety have improved again in terms of recordable injury frequency rate. Now I use that to judge how management teams are operating in our factories and our offices and wherever they're running as well as employee engagement involvement. Those numbers continue to drop. It dropped 90% plus in the last 15 years, and they're down significantly again already in the first 3 months of 2016. Our quality metrics continue to be good. We just had some reaffirmation of that in Germany at our big bauma show there and talking with customers and our big dealer Zeppelins, so I'm happy with that. Variable margin continues pretty well, even with the absence of our big -- obviously mining and oil business that we've -- that are high-margin contributors in the past. So all in all, operationally, our Lean efforts, our value chain is working. Our material cost reductions for our purchasing group is working very well and continues on the path that we have been. 
A little bit more on restructuring. We actually bumped that up a bit in the first quarter, as Mike described, for the truck. Our global workforce is down about 8,600 people. We've announced the closure, a consolidation of about 15 facilities were on plan. About $0.5 billion in cost out, as Mike mentioned. About $375 million of that or so is period cost, which is you would expect to see. And we will make our goals. I'm very confident this year in what we projected. It's been a tough road, needless to say, when we take those kinds of deep actions. And we've got several more coming for the rest of the year on plan that would be included in what we announced in September, but it's working. 
A strong balance sheet is another important area for us, and we're -- we've been very focused on that for a long time. You'll recall we entered '09 with a highly leveraged balance sheet. We did buy back some shares. We reduced our debt-to-cap ratio. Today, we're sitting on about $6 billion in cash. And in fact, debt to cap improved again by almost a couple points in the first quarter. So our balance sheet is strong. Our priority is the dividend, as I've said before, and will continue to say. And that balance sheet strength is one of the reasons we're able to do that and get through this turbulent period. 
Just a quick comment on Cat Financial. Nothing really obvious to report there, continue to be very tightly controlled and managed. 80% of our customer base there have a balance less than $100,000, so it's a very diverse portfolio. Our past dues bumped up a bit in the first quarter, not to be -- or to be expected in the first quarter, kind of a seasonal thing, but less than last year. So I think all the external and internal metrics we look at point to that business continuing on the path it's been, which is a real strength for us. 
And then finally, a couple of things on the future. We have maintained R&D, and that's one that has been paying off well for us. We did not cut R&D to the bone as we might have in earlier cycles, in '09, and that's paying off for us now in terms of the product that's out there. We invested about $2 billion the last 3 years. Those products will come to market in the next 2 to 5 years. And I can tell you what I've seen. There will be outstanding additions to our fleet and really be nice payout. So to the extent we can, we're going to hold R&D and cut everywhere else. 
Our Lean efforts are working. 3 years, over $1 billion of cost reduction through our variable costs on how we're going about that. Inventory improvement is down about $6 billion since 2012 as well. We've seen a big cultural change across our factories, and some of that's demonstrated by safety, of course. 
Then lastly, I'd focus on digital. And I know some of you were at bauma in Germany, and we showed -- we just started to scratch the surface of that by introducing The Age of Smart Iron. We intend to be the leader here in terms of asset management, product health, productivity, safety, sustainability and predictive analytics, which is coming, will be a cornerstone of our CONEXPO display next March in Las Vegas. Today, we've got 400,000 connected assets and growing. By this summer, every one of our machines will come off the line, being able to be connected and provide some kind of feedback and operational productivity to the owner, to the dealer and to us for improvements down the road. The idea being to get to a point where we can show the customer on his iPhone everything going on with his machine, his fleet, its health, its run rate, its productivity and so on. And we're -- we'll be very close to that. We've got over 100 customers on experimental basis with that right now, several dealers participating and a lot of pull from the marketplace for this, which is quite exciting. 
So I think, Mike, I'll stop there, and we can move into Q&A, and we can embellish on any of that as we need to as we go forward. Thank you."

Now there is much of the world, Europe, for example, Japan, where we sell in local currency, so not as big an issue. We adjust for that. But in places like the U.S. and much of the Africa and Middle East where transaction prices are essentially in dollars, competitors of ours that are coming from a manufacturing base outside the U.S. are being more aggressive on pricing. And so that's putting pressure on us. So that's quite a bit. And then of course, in mining, it's a deal-by-deal battle. And that business certainly hasn't seen any signs of improvement yet. So dollar is quite a bit of it, I think."

And we are -- I just maybe leave it at that, but it's a balance, and it's kind of a market share gain for us because that drives this company long term."

There could be a mark-to-market change at the end of the year if interest rates go up or down or there's a material change in returns on the funded asset portfolio.

But if you look at the operating cash flow for this quarter, it was a couple of hundred million positive, and that's despite 2 big negatives in the first quarter. As a part of our restructuring costs last year, we had a fair bit of employee-related costs. And that was, for the most part, paid in January. So there was, I think, about $400 million of extra negative cash flow in the first quarter that was related to the restructuring actions from last year. So that was a bit of a drag. And then of course, in the first quarter, we always pay. We accrue incentive compensation throughout the year, but it gets paid in the first quarter. And that was, I think, $600 million. So between the 2, we had close to $1 billion drag on operating cash flow in the quarter. So I think you'll see that improve. Operating cash flow ought to improve quite a bit from first quarter levels as we go through the rest of the year. I think on inventory, we've been pretty public by saying that the one operational thing that we've not been as happy with is inventory turns. There's all kinds of reasons why quarter to quarter to quarter things can change. But on balance, our forecast has an improvement in turns built into this year, and we have everybody in the company working to make that happen."

And a general question, it sure feels like a lot of people are trying to target -- bringing the whole cost curve down to 60. [ph] I wonder if you feel like you're already there on cost.

In terms of the cost curve, a lot of the product that we have, particularly on the reciprocating engine side, is similar -- take a 3500 series engines. It goes into machines, electric power. It goes into marine. It goes into providing power for a drill rig or a frac pump. So it's actually spread across a number of industries. I mean, we've worked on the cost structure. And I think, actually, not just for oil and gas but across most of our products. And I think at the sales level that we're at right now based on the material cost reductions we've got, the Lean-related efficiency improvements, the period cost reductions, the restructuring, I think we've actually done a pretty darn good job on trying to getting the cost structure in line, for the most part, with where reasonable demand would be."

So -- no, what we did at Barclays was just trying to get expectations set there thereabouts where we'd thought all quarter. There was not a big step-down or run-down, and we ended up actually being pretty close to what we thought. Now we're not -- it's -- I mean, we've got many businesses, not just 3 segments.

Trying to forecast exchange rates over the next 3 months, we just don't do. So we would be expecting currency exchange and that other income and expense line to essentially be 0. In the first quarter, if memory serves me, we had about $0.05 a share, I think, negative. So that would be coming out. So that would be a little bit of a boost in the second quarter. And then we have higher sales in the $500 million to $600 million range. And it's probably -- you probably want to use something closer to our variable margin rate. I mean, period cost, over time, like year-over-year, we can fluctuate them up or down. But in the short term, rather than kind of an incremental margin kind of look, variable margin is probably a little bit better indicator. And for us, that's right around 40%. So I think a little less drag from currency translation and higher sales and maybe a little bit more continued cost reduction, but mostly it's sales and absence of exchange loss and a little bit of product mix, too."

Normally, we think of incrementals as around 25%. But I think based on all the actions that we have done, when recovery starts, and Doug has been probably the most vocal in saying this, and I believe it, too, we should probably do a bit better than that when things turn around because we certainly have plenty of capacity right now for most of our products and a period fixed cost structure that could handle a bit more."

And at some point, that replacement cycle will come to us, parts first, then rebuilds and then new truck orders. And those are the things we are waiting for. We're closer to it than ever, I think, is because of the longevity of the replacement cycle here. And we should start to see that, I would say, at any time.

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And on the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO. 
We're going to do today's call similar to what we've done the past couple of quarters. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have that slide deck in front of you, it's available on our caterpillar.com website with the conference call webcast link. Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. Any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And that will be in the section labeled Results Webcasts. 
So if you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And certainly this morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information, and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found under Item 1A Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the forward-looking statements in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can be found in our financial release. And again, that's been posted on the caterpillar.com website. 
Okay. With that, let's flip to Page 3 of the presentation, which is the agenda. I'm going to walk through the first quarter and the 2016 outlook, then Doug will go over a page of key points. And then Brad and Doug and I will move to Q&A and answer your questions. 
So with that, let's move to Page 4, and this is a pretty high-level summary of sales and profit for the quarter. And in a little box at the top right-hand corner of the page, I think, is an important point. First quarter is quite a bit lower than the second (sic) [first] quarter a year ago, and I'll cover that here in a second. But it was essentially right in line with what we were expecting for the first quarter in terms of sales and profit and profit excluding restructuring costs. 
So this page then primarily covers this year versus first quarter of last year, and sales were down $3.2 billion. $1.6 billion of that was Energy & Transportation; $1 billion, Construction, $0.5 billion, Resource Industries. And I'll cover those in a little more detail on the next page. 
Sales volume was the primary driver of the $1.57 decline in profit per share or a decline of $1.40 excluding restructuring costs. 
Price realization contributed another $234 million, and I'll cover price realization a little bit more in the context of the outlook. 
Other income and expense was unfavorable. That's below operating profit, $194 million. Two things really in there. In the first quarter of last year, we had $120 million gain, and that was from the sale of our -- the last part of our interest in our third-party logistics business. And then the difference between currency translation and hedging was negative, the primary reason for the rest of the $64 million. 
Restructuring costs were unfavorable, $126 million in the month. That comes after our announcement last September where we accelerated actions. And then in addition to that, in the first quarter we recorded a large chunk of restructuring costs for our ending production of our vocational on-highway truck, and that was not considered in the outlook before. 
And then on the bright side today, we have $474 million, almost $500 million, of lower costs in the quarter. That's period cost and variable cost. And certainly, for the period cost piece, a decent chunk of that was from the restructuring actions that we've been implementing over the last few years. 
So let's move on to Page 5. This is a little more explanation on the sales change. It was a pretty good magnitude, $3.2 billion, so we thought it would be a good idea to kind of go through the elements. Energy & Transportation had the most significant decline, and that was $1.6 billion. Now oil and gas and transportation made up over 80% of that. 
With oil and gas, and we've been saying this for the past year, we had a sizable backlog for reciprocating engines for drilling and well servicing as we ended 2014 and started into 2015. And those turned into sales for us despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2015. So we always knew the comparables between first and first and second to second were going to be tough. That was a big piece of it. We also had a high level of locomotive sales in the first quarter of last year, and that was certainly not the case in the first quarter of this year. So those 2 things were the bulk of the decline in Energy & Transportation. 
If we move on to Construction, the single biggest reason for the decline in sales is not demand. It's change in dealer inventory. So last year, we had a much more sizable increase in dealer inventory in the first quarter, and it's not uncommon to have an increase in the first quarter as dealers stock -- choose to stock up a bit for the second quarter selling season. That's spring and summer, and that's more activity. But the increase this year was smaller than the increase last year, and that was about half of that decline. About 1/3 of Construction Industries' decline was end-user demand, mostly North America and Latin America. The North American piece, we're actually seeing, in terms of general construction and infrastructure, decent business in North America. Much of the decline in demand in North America is in the oil patch. So the first quarter of last year, that was still going fairly strong, and we think that's a decent piece of the reason Construction is lower. And as we go through the year, we ought to be lapping that because it declined as we went through last year. Latin America is down. Brazil, for example, and Mexico are quite a bit lower. Asia, on the other hand, demand was actually up in the quarter, and that's a good thing. I'm sure Doug will talk about it in a little bit, but China was better for us. And then EAME, principally in the Africa-Middle East part of it, was down slightly. Price realization was negative $172 million. So of the $234 million for the company, $172 million of it was in Construction. And again, when we get to the outlook, I'll talk a little more about that. 
In Resource Industries, we were down $0.5 billion, most all of that was volume. Essentially, no dealer inventory impact there, and price realization was relatively benign in terms of dollars, a negative $38 million. So most of the Resource Industries is lower end-user demand. So that's a recap of the sales change. 
Let's move forward and talk about the outlook. We did trim the range for sales and revenues. We moved it from -- a range of $40 billion to $44 billion to a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So the midpoint is down about $1 billion, and that represents about 2% profit per share move from $3.50 to $3. Restructuring costs actually are up a bit from $400 million to about $550 million, and the vocational on-highway truck, our ceasing of production there is most of that difference. And excluding the increase in restructuring costs, we're moving from $4 to $3.70 a share. There are puts and takes on costs, but the primary reason for the decline in the $4 to $3.70 is the $1 billion decline in sales at the midpoint. So that's the outlook for sales and profit. 
I thought I would take a minute and talk about the elements of the sales change. So first with Construction, really no change in our volume. I mean, there are some, again, puts and takes here. China, again, is a bit better. We took the forecast up a little for that. Latin America, a little weaker than expected. Sentiment around Construction, and I think Doug will talk about this in a few minutes, is a bit better. That's good. We like that, but it's a bit too soon, I think, to start playing that into the outlook. So fundamentally, the outlook for volume in Construction Industries is pretty neutral. 
Resource Industries. Demand looks like it's going to be down again, weaker than we had expected when we started the year, even though it's already pretty low. The recent improvement in commodity prices is a good thing. We're happy that that's positive for our customers, but it's certainly not enough and it hasn't been around long enough to drive a sustained increase in demand for our product.  Now that decline in Resource Industries is about 1/4 of our decline in the outlook. 
So Energy & Transportation, this is where the outlook for the year came down the most. And essentially, it's for the most part transportation-related. The biggest piece of that is rail. Looks like it's going to be a tougher year for our customers in rail. They have a lot of locomotives idled, and we think some of the orders on hand are going to get moved out to a -- later than this year. Marine is weaker. A competitor of ours announced results yesterday, and they talked about the same thing, particularly around workboats that service offshore oil. We're also down a bit in transportation because of the stopping of the on-highway vocational trucks. There was sales in the forecast for that when we started the year, and that's going to ramp down fairly quickly. 
And the last item that affects sales and it affects profit, and that's price realization. When we started the year, we were thinking negative price of maybe about 0.5%, and that's what was in our outlook. We've raised that to about 1%. And from a year-over-year standpoint, we think that, that will be mostly in the first half of the year. We saw prices trending down in the second half of last year, so the comps are particularly more difficult in the first half than they'll be in the second half. And most of that decline is going to be in Resource Industries and Construction Industries. 
In terms of the timing of the outlook. As you know, there's always some seasonality in our business. And if you look at Caterpillar over the last 20 years, about 49% of our sales usually end up in the first half of the year, and about 51% end up in the second half of the year. This year, that's going to be a little bit more skewed to the second half. We're thinking maybe 47.5% or so in the first half, 52% in the second half. And that represents about $600 million more in the second half of the year than kind of our historical average would lead you to expect. I just wanted to put that in for context so you didn't think that there was some big hockey stick at the end of the year. There is not. A bigger second half is normal. Much of the reason for a little bit more skewing in the second half is rail. And we've talked about this for the last couple of years. We'll be introducing the Tier 4 locomotive in North America in the second half. And then in addition to that, our turbine business is a little bit more skewed to the second half. We've got a good backlog there. In fact, the backlog from first quarter to second quarter is about the same -- or I'm sorry, from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter is about the same. 
So now what that all means for the second quarter is that sales will be up about $0.5 billion or so from the first quarter to the second quarter. That's about $10 billion. And on that, we think profit will be just a shade less than $1 a share. 
So with that, I would like to turn the floor over to our Chairman, Doug Oberhelman."

I'll just walk down through this slide I hope you have in front of you on the -- these 7 points I'd like to make with you and shed a little color, and then we'll go to Q&A as well. 
First of all, around China. I was over there about 3 weeks ago, as I usually do in March, to attend a state-sponsored forum of CEOs from Europe and United States. And there's a lot of sharing about government policy, where they're going with the 5-year plan, where they're going with the 10-year plan, for that matter as well, and a lot of discussion around the transition from an investment economy and consumer economy, and I think that's part of what we're all feeling. They also announced about the same time, or a little bit before that actually, a little bit of a stimulus, which was minor, and frankly, we're feeling that. This is the first post-Chinese New Year in probably 3 that we have seen a continued industry uplift for the industries that we serve around construction. It's not a hockey stick. It's not a boom. It's not a 2010, but it is the first time we've seen that happen, and we have lifted our schedules as a result of that for this year. We talked about that in the release. We'll see how long that goes. This is around infrastructure, primarily high-speed rail. And a lot of it is development in the West, where it's really needed, where there's a lot of very backwards places. So they recognize that, and they're working on that, trying to balance, I think, the infrastructure needs with what I described, plus continued investment in airports and so on with the consumerism they're trying to drive. And that's the balance they're -- I think they're trying to pull off. We'll see how it goes. So far, so good. 
In the U.S., any -- just about any market that's away from oil is doing pretty good. Southeastern U.S., Southwest U.S., we're feeling the benefit now more of housing. In fact, construction and paving segments were up about 7%. That's positive. When you get around the oil patch, there's an oversupply of everything, and that's kind of shadowing the numbers. I think once that balances out, we'll be back to -- or be able to show a fairly anemic but stable growth. And we're looking -- I just heard about the South Carolina infrastructure plan the other day. It's a $4 billion program they're trying to pass. There's a lot of states lining up to get those kind of things done. And then of course, the federal -- the FAST Act comes in on top of that right now. And as I've said before, I think the last call, we're looking at that more into '17. But certainly, that's giving states confidence, and we're seeing more and more of that around the country. So that's building. Again, I'm not here to project a hockey stick by any means, but it's -- appears to be sustainable and good news for us. Energy is, as Mike said and everybody knows, is really flat. We haven't seen any kind of a uptick in our numbers with oil at $43 or whatever it is at these rates, It's probably going to have to go awhile before we do see that. So we're getting through that. 
Going on to the second point. Operational performance continues to be very satisfying here. I know that some of these metrics aren't ones you all watch every day, but I do. Certainly, the safety have improved again in terms of recordable injury frequency rate. Now I use that to judge how management teams are operating in our factories and our offices and wherever they're running as well as employee engagement involvement. Those numbers continue to drop. They've dropped 90% plus in the last 15 years, and they're down significantly again, already, in the first 3 months of 2016. Our quality metrics continue to be good. We just had some reaffirmation of that in Germany at our big bauma show there and talking with customers and our big dealer Zeppelin, so I'm happy with that. Variable margin continues pretty well, even with the absence of our big -- obviously mining and oil business that we've -- that are high-margin contributors in the past. So all in all, operationally, our Lean efforts, our value chain is working. Our material cost reductions for our purchasing group is working very well and continues on the path that we have been. 
A little bit more on restructuring. We actually bumped that up a bit in the first quarter, as Mike described, for the truck. Our global workforce is down about 8,600 people. We've announced a closure, a consolidation of about 15 facilities. We're on plan. About $0.5 billion in cost out, as Mike mentioned. About $375 million of that or so is period cost, which is -- you would expect to see. And we will make our goals. I'm very confident this year in what we projected. It's been a tough road, needless to say, when we take those kinds of deep actions. And we've got several more coming for the rest of the year on plan that would be included in what we announced in September, but it's working. 
A strong balance sheet is another important area for us, and we're -- we've been very focused on that for a long time. You'll recall we entered '09 with a highly leveraged balance sheet. We did buy back some shares. We reduced our debt-to-cap ratio. Today, we're sitting on about $6 billion in cash. And in fact, debt to cap improved again by almost a couple points in the first quarter. So our balance sheet is strong. Our priority is the dividend, as I've said before, and will continue to say. And that balance sheet strength is one of the reasons we're able to do that and get through this turbulent period. 
Just a quick comment on Cat Financial. Nothing really obvious to report there, continue to be very tightly controlled and managed. 80% of our customer base there have a balance less than $100,000, so it's a very diverse portfolio. Our past dues bumped up a bit in the first quarter, not to be -- or to be expected in the first quarter, kind of a seasonal thing, but less than last year. So I think all the external and internal metrics we look at point to that business continuing on the path it's been, which is a real strength for us. 
And then finally, a couple of things on the future. We have maintained R&D, and that's one that has been paying off well for us. We did not cut R&D to the bone as we might have in earlier cycles, in '09, and that's paying off for us now in terms of the product that's out there. We invested about $2 billion the last 3 years. Those products will come to market in the next 2 to 5 years. And I can tell you, what I've seen, they will be outstanding additions to our fleet and really be nice payoff. So to the extent we can, we're going to hold R&D and cut everywhere else. 
Our Lean efforts are working. 3 years, over $1 billion of cost reduction through our variable costs on how we're going about that. Inventory improvement is down about $6 billion since 2012 as well. We've seen a big culture change across our factories, and some of that's demonstrated by safety, of course. 
Then lastly, I'd focus on digital. And I know some of you were at bauma in Germany, and we showed -- we just started to scratch the surface of that by introducing The Age of Smart Iron. We intend to be the leader here in terms of asset management, product health, productivity, safety, sustainability. And predictive analytics, which is coming, will be a cornerstone of our CONEXPO display next March in Las Vegas. Today, we've got 400,000 connected assets and growing. By this summer, every one of our machines will come off the line being able to be connected and provide some kind of feedback and operational productivity to the owner, to the dealer and to us for improvements down the road. The idea being to get to a point where we can show the customer on his iPhone everything going on with his machine, his fleet, its health, its run rate, its productivity and so on. And we're -- we'll be very close to that. We've got over 100 customers on experimental basis with that right now, several dealers participating and a lot of pull from the marketplace for this, which is quite exciting. 
So I think, Mike, I'll stop there, and we can move into Q&A, and we can embellish on any of that as we need to as we go forward. Thank you."

As a part of our restructuring costs last year, we had a fair bit of employee-related costs. And that was, for the most part, paid in January. So there was, I think, about $400 million of extra negative cash flow in the first quarter that was related to the restructuring actions from last year. So that was a bit of a drag. And then of course, in the first quarter, we always pay. We accrue incentive compensation throughout the year, but it gets paid in the first quarter. And that was, I think, $600 million. So between the 2, we had close to $1 billion drag on operating cash flow in the quarter. So I think you'll see that improve.

In terms of the cost curve, a lot of the product that we have, particularly on the reciprocating engine side, is similar -- take a 3500 series engine. It goes into machines, electric power. It goes into marine. It goes into providing power for a drill rig or a frac pump. So it's actually spread across a number of industries. I mean, we've worked on the cost structure.

How many more are we thinking about in front of us on a relative basis to what's been done? And in the past, you've spoken about low 20s incremental margin targets in a recovery. I'm wondering if the thought process has changed at all based on the change in the footprint."

When we made the announcement last year in September about these restructuring actions, we were thinking maybe 20 facilities would be impacted. We've announced about 15, plus now this on-highway vocational truck. So at least in terms of numbers of facilities, I think we're pretty far down that path. There's still more to go. And certainly it will take a little -- even for the ones that we've announced, these phase-ins, it takes a while to shut down and change and shed the cost. So we still, from a saving standpoint, we still have quite a bit to go. So that's a positive. On the incrementals, I think low 20s is too small a number. Normally, we think of incrementals as around 25%. But I think based on all the actions that we have done, when recovery starts, and Doug has been probably the most vocal in saying this, and I believe it, too, we should probably do a bit better than that when things turn around because we certainly have plenty of capacity right now for most of our products and a period fixed cost structure that could handle a bit more."

There's no question, though, that the government is concerned about growth, and too slow of a growth and a change in growth will be much more negative than some stimulus now.

But at the same time, the stories were much more positive and even France, an election year there is stimulating a bit into infrastructure. And some of those big projects, we're feeding. And thus, our big dealer there was feeling better. So I would say that a bit -- a very small bit of optimism is in order in Europe, but I've been there now the last 2 years. I said about a year ago that Europe was 2 years behind the United States. I still believe that. So it's a very, very slow crawl out. I don't see much negativism there right now. I'd say the downside is continued -- the continued disappointment around oil and energy, I think that could go a while. I do think that our numbers are at a point where it's hard to go from -- yes, from 2 to 1 is 100% drop, but it's not a material amount of impact on us. But we saw some of that in the first quarter in Resource. So we're getting near the bottom in all that, just because there's -- we're at the bottom. But the downside would be -- and any big downside is going to be something we all don't see coming. And frankly, I've talked about that before, too.

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And as usual, on the call with me this morning, we have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. 
Today, I'll start by walking you through a short slide deck, similar to what we've done over the past couple of quarters, and then we'll move on to the Q&A after that. 
So if you don't have the slide deck in front of you right now, it's available on our website at caterpillar.com in the Investors section. And it's where the webcast link was.

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
If you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck discussions, either individually or in the aggregate, could make actual results to differ materially -- can also be found in Cautionary Statements under Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can also be found in the financial release on our website and is also the back page of today's slide deck.
So with that, let's get started on the slide deck, and I would ask you to flip over to Page 4. It's the comparison of the second quarter 2016 with the second quarter of 2015. It has the key lines for the second quarter versus last year. Sales and revenues down about $2 billion. About half of that was Energy & Transportation, and the other half was split closely evenly between Resource Industries and Construction Industries. And I'll talk a little bit more about sales in a minute. 
And profit. Primary drivers of the decline in profit from $1.31 to $0.93 a share this quarter, and excluding restructuring, $1.09, down from $1.40, so a $0.31 decline. 
By far, the biggest negative in the quarter was the decline in sales volume, and that included negative sales mix as more of the decline was in higher-margin products like oil and gas. 
Price realization was also pretty substantially negative in the quarter, and that was off $233 million. 
Now on the favorable side, below operating profit, other income and expense was a positive $156 million. And that was mostly all due to the absence of below operating profit exchange losses from a year ago. An important point, I think, to note about the second quarter was exchange had actually little impact on the quarter itself. 
And then bottom, the most substantial positive in the quarter from a profit standpoint was cost reduction. Period-end variable costs were favorable $670 million versus a year ago. And that just brings up the point here that we've been really focused on execution. That includes the cost reduction, but is not exclusively cost reduction. And we've improved our market position as well in -- around the word, and in particular, in China as well. 
So let's switch onto the next page, Page 5. It's a discussion of sales and revenues. Again, the biggest sales decline in the quarter was in Energy & Transportation, just shy of $1 billion. We've been talking about this for the last year or so. The decline really started about midyear last year. So this second quarter is kind of the last, I think, of the big declines that we're going to see, particularly related to oil. First to first, second to second. By the time we get to the third quarter, and certainly by the time we get to the fourth quarter of last year, it was pretty much all baked in. In fact, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, the comps will be a lot more like the prior year. So this should be the last quarter of declines in -- at least in this size. 
Resource Industries down about $600 million. And most of that decline was lower end-user demand and a little bit from pricing. I mean mining is just -- continued to be a very challenged industry. Customers are pushing out replacement purchases. They're delaying as much repair as they can. And we see that in our sales. 
Now relative to kind of the trend, it's about flat with where we were in the first quarter, so no continuing deterioration from where we were last quarter, but down from a year ago. 
And then finally, Construction Industries, down just under $400 million. A little more than half of the decline was price realization, and it is a pretty tough pricing environment out there today in construction. And we see it everywhere. We see it in the U.S. We see it outside the U.S. 
Now a word about this because I know it may seem to you like it's accelerating, but it's kind of not. It's started going up about midyear last year, the sales variance, the discounting. And so we had negatives in the second half of last year. The first half of this year is comparing with a better period a year ago. So it looks like it's quite a bit of an increase. But it's not much of an increase actually from where we've been over the last 2 or 3 quarters. And I think as we go on and talk about this in the outlook, we kind of see it starting to flatten out. 
Sales were down in North America, Latin America. Europe, Africa, Middle East was pretty flat year-over-year. Europe up; Africa, Middle East, down. And sales in Asia were actually up year-over-year despite price pressure. 
So that's a quick run through of sales. I know related to Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of concern around the turbine business because it's been pretty strong for quite some time. Our -- just a couple of facts about that. We reported on the backlog last quarter, said it was up slightly from year-end. Second quarter of this year is about spot on where we were at the end of the quarter. So we're not seeing any deterioration there. It's a little early to talk about 2017, but all indications are the year is progressing pretty well. 
Oil lower. Work backlog, sales around natural gas and natural gas pipelines are still pretty strong. Okay, so that's sales. 
Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk a little bit about the operating profit change and cost in particular. So this is the waterfall chart that we have actually in the release. No big new information on here outside of the release. It just highlights how well we've done on cost reduction. So in total, between variable and period, or you might call relatively fixed cost, we're down about $670 million. And that's gone a long way to offset the impact of lower volume and product mix. And you can see on here price realization, the negative $233 million. And actually, we've had more variable cost reduction if you think material costs and efficiency and that type of thing. We've about offset the impact on price realization with that. 
So year-to-date, if we turn to the next page, just talk a little bit about what we've done on costs. So on the first quarter, between period costs and variable cost, we were down just under $0.5 billion. This quarter again was $670 million. So through the first half of the year, we've taken over $1.1 billion of cost out. If you look up at the top of this page, in the yellow bubble up there, what we're saying is we're on track, our expectations are that we'll get -- we'll end this year with well over $2 billion of cost reduction. That's coming really in 3 sort of general buckets. The most significant is restructuring, and that is everything from combining office functions and reducing people to taking out manufacturing floor space and related costs. Material costs have also been favorable. We've had a good track record on material costs over the past few years. I mean we're down over $1 billion over the last few years. And it really comes from mostly design and sourcing-related cost reduction, and then important, but to a lesser degree, commodity-related cost reduction. And then everything else. It's everything from a bit lower short-term incentive pay based on lower results and then cost reductions throughout the company, every place we can find it, everything from travel and entertainment expense to consulting spend. So wherever we can take money out, we're working really hard to do that. 
So bottom line, we're investing in the things we need to for the future, things like digital and really important product programs. Everything else, we're really trying to put a lid on and cut where we can. And the results have actually been pretty good. 
So let's flip over to the next page. That would be Page 8, talk a little bit about the outlook for the year. When we were sitting here a quarter ago, we were expecting sales in a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So $41 billion as a midpoint. We've taken that down about -- from midpoint to midpoint, about $0.75 billion. And the gist of that is just everything that we're seeing in the economy today around the world, additional risk, everything from the results of the Brexit vote and the short-term uncertainties that that causes, the trouble we've seen in Turkey, all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections, oil prices have come off a little over the last couple of months. It's not any one thing, I would say. We've said this in the outlook. We have sluggish economic growth throughout the world in general, but not enough to drive growth in our end markets. And the news we've seen over the last few months is definitely not giving us more confidence. 
So the outlook for profit is $2.75 a share, and that's all in, excluding restructuring costs, which are going to be about $700 million now this year. Net of that, we're at about 300 -- or $3, I'm sorry -- $3.55 a share. And both on the top line and bottom line, our estimate is actually pretty close to the last consensus analyst estimates that we've seen. So we're pretty close to where we think the market is. 
Now one point about this outlook, and this is on -- in Q&A 11 in our release on Page 15. It has been negatively affected about $0.08 a share by taxes. So we hadn't made the change in how we're looking at taxes on our profit excluding restructuring cost. The outlook would have been $0.08 higher, which isn't too bad of performance considering $750 million decline in the top line. And I think it just goes back to the main theme of execution, cost reduction, doing everything we possibly can to keep the company strong and give us the ability to invest in the future. 
One last point I'll make about sales, and this might well be on your minds as well, and that's kind of the status of dealer inventory. We're pretty flat right now in dealer inventory with the year-end last year, but we think it's going to come down quite a bit over the next 2 quarters. And that's not entirely unusual. Last year, we had a reduction as well. Full year reduction in dealer inventory this year is probably going to be not quite, but close to double what we did last year. And it's not so much -- and you've asked this question before, ""Do we have a glut of inventory?"" And I would certainly not describe it as that. I think one of the things that's happening out there is a little bit of our own doing, and it's around lean. If you look at our delivery performance and the stability of our delivery performance dealers, it's actually improved quite a bit over the last 5 years. We're at a point now where dealers, we think, have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver what they need and when they need it. And we think that's causing them to both order less. So as our delivery times have come down in construction, our backlog comes down a little. I mean, think of it this way, it's an oversimplified example. But if we have delivery times that were 1 day, we wouldn't have much backlog. Dealers would order, and we would ship it. So I think one of the reasons that construction backlog is a little lower and one of the reason that we're getting probably more aggressive dealer inventory declines is how well we're performing on Lean relative to delivery performance. We knew that was likely to happen in the scheme of things. It's a good thing. 
So let's move on to the next -- the outlook. Let's move on to the next page, and that's -- I think it's probably a good time to talk about first half versus second half. We're through half of the year. Probably time to reflect a little bit on how the second half of the year is likely to shape up. End-user demand should be a fair bit higher than the first half of the year. I mean we have our sales, which we think are going to be $600 million to $700 million higher than the first half. And that does include some substantial dealer inventory reduction. And we have profit per share, excluding restructuring cost, up $0.09. With restructuring, it's down a little, and that's because of the extra cost for restructuring in the back half. 
So if you look at how the sales shape up, that 65 -- or that $6.5 billion -- $0.65 billion increase in sales, Construction Industries is likely to be down a little bit. End-user demand, pretty flat. But because of dealer inventory reductions, their sales are likely to be a bit down. That's our forecast anyway. Resource Industries, just slightly up from the first half from rate and not a lot. No big changes there in terms of trends. And then Energy & Transportation is responsible essentially for the increase in sales. And that's a -- that is mostly seasonal pattern on some of the big project kind of sales that we have. Turbines, for example. And we expect a bit more sales out of rail in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of profit, we have the $0.09 a share -- better profit in the second half of the year than the first half. And the higher sales volume is the most significant reason for that. 
Pricing. Let's talk about this, and I touched on it a minute ago. We -- on a year-over-year basis, the negative impact of pricing ought to start easing a little bit. And that's because -- no, we really saw a kickup midyear last year. And first half versus second half, though, forget about last year, we don't see much change in the pricing environment. 
Inventory cost absorption will be a modest negative in the back half of the year. We're looking at taking inventory down $500 million, $600 million -- our own inventory, not dealer inventory, down $500 million, $600 million in the back half of the year. It will be a little hit to profit, but positive free cash flow. We also had some sale of security gains in the second quarter for financial services division and for the insurance portion of that. And we're not expecting that to repeat in the second half. 
Cost overall, we think, will be fairly neutral first half to second half. We do have additional period cost reduction that we're looking at in the second half of the year, but with kind of lows seasonal cost in the first quarter and probably a little bit of efficiency negative. Production is going to come down because of the decline in dealer inventory. We think those will come close to offsetting during the second half of the year. 
Now we don't actually have an outlook for the third quarter. But if you think about the second half of the year, in a lot of ways, I think it will look similar to first half of the year. And if you think to the first half of the year, we had a low first quarter and a pretty good second quarter. And I think, as we look at the rest of the year, the third and fourth quarter will play out similarly. We'll have probably a weak third quarter and a much better fourth quarter. Again, a lot of that is the timing of some of this E&T sales around larger projects. So we're thinking that third quarter will probably be $400 million, $500 million in sales better than the first quarter and profit will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 a share better than the first quarter. And then the fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Sales slightly higher, profit about the same as Q2. So that's how we think the rest of the year will shape up. 
So let's move on to the last slide that I'm going to cover today. That's Slide 10, and that's kind of key discussion points. Just a little quick recap of much of what I talked about. On balance, there's not much change in demand from the industries that we're serving. Construction demand is relatively steady, but with continuing price pressure. We have no clear signs of recovery in mining or oil and gas or rail, for that matter. Good operational performance continues. Overall, our market position has improved. And that's been a continuing story for most of the last 5 years. Our decremental margins are pretty good and better than our target range. And that's despite a pretty negative sales mix second quarter to second quarter. Cost reduction is substantial at $1.1 billion year-to-date. We're thinking over $2 billion for the full year. We're on track with our restructuring actions. They have contributed to cost reduction this year, and that will contribute to more in 2017. And then finally, our balance sheet is strong. And that's very important to us because maintaining our credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities for us. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio for our machinery -- machining engines -- our Energy & Transportation business was 39%, about 21 net of about $6.8 billion of cash that we had on hand at the end of the quarter. 
So that's a wrap-up. We're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call."

So a lot of these projects might hit them quicker than they hit us. I mean, we're still expecting a decline in dealer inventory this year, so -- and particularly, in the second half of the year. So if we were just selling to end-user demand, sales would be a bit better than they are right now. So yes, I don't want to sound totally negative. It doesn't look to us like it's continuing to go down. And there are a few small signs like that, particularly like the rebuild activity that's a little positive. But we track share of what's being sold, and we're not seeing deterioration there. So -- it would be nice if we would improve a lot quicker. And hopefully, somewhere down the road, it will."

That, plus the inventory declines, plus the absence of the sort of $0.04 we got on the security sale in the second quarter, all kind of make it look like it doesn't hang together first half and second half of sales."

Everybody wants to know when we're going to start recovering in that trend towards midcycle, but we still need to be prepared for what could happen in the next -- in the short term on the downside. And so we've talked about kind of 25% to 30% decremental. I would say we're still committed to that. I would also say that we're being extremely directive in the things that we fund, things like digital, which will be up significantly this year over last year, things like funding the businesses that we believe have the highest opportunity to improve the value of the company and it -- and our operating profit after capital charge, which we call OPACC in the medium term. So we want to fund those industries which we think are attractive for us and where we play well. And things that are not as attractive are the places that we look first to cut. So we're still in that process, and we're still preparing to stay ahead of the game. And I would say that, if required, we would be ready."

It's probably split 2/3 construction, 1/3 resource in that sort of ballpark. And in terms of adequate levels, I mean, I've tried to address this point. I think adequate levels is a little bit of a moving target around delivery performance. So again, if we were able to cut delivery performance in half from where it's at now, dealers would feel comfortable holding less inventory. If our delivery -- if -- let's say things ticked up, orders ticked up, the market is heated up, and let's say we were -- we had trouble keeping up, that would concern dealers and they would order even more. They would want to hold even more. But just the opposite is happening right now. We have excellent delivery performance. They can get pretty much what they need when their customers need it. And so that's causing them to hold or want to hold less. And the more -- the better we do with Lean, the more that will probably be the case. So I would -- I'm trying to stress a point. I don't think dealer inventories are excessive. I mean there's a reasonable range, but I think they will come down over the second half of the year."

So that's part of the increase in the back half of the year."

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And as usual, on the call with me this morning, we have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. 
Today, I'll start by walking you through a short slide deck, similar to what we've done over the past couple of quarters, and then we'll move on to the Q&A after that. 
So if you don't have the slide deck in front of you right now, it's available on our website, at caterpillar.com, in the Investors section. And it's where the webcast link was. 
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. And any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
If you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck discussions, either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results to differ materially, can also be found in Cautionary Statements under Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can also be found in the financial release on our website and is also the back page of today's slide deck.
So with that, let's get started on the slide deck, and I would ask you to flip over to Page 4. It's the comparison of the second quarter 2016 with the second quarter of 2015. It has the key lines for the second quarter versus last year. Sales and revenues down about $2 billion. About half of that was Energy & Transportation, and the other half was split closely evenly between Resource Industries and Construction Industries. And I'll talk a little bit more about sales in a minute. 
And profit. Primary drivers of the decline in profit from $1.31 to $0.93 a share this quarter, and excluding restructuring, $1.09, down from $1.40, so a $0.31 decline. 
By far, the biggest negative in the quarter was the decline in sales volume, and that included negative sales mix as more of the decline was in higher-margin products, like oil and gas. 
Price realization was also pretty substantially negative in the quarter, and that was off $233 million. 
Now on the favorable side, below operating profit, other income and expense was a positive $156 million. And that was mostly all due to the absence of below operating profit exchange losses from a year ago. An important point, I think, to note about this second quarter was exchange had actually little impact on the quarter itself. 
And then the bottom, the most substantial positive in the quarter from a profit standpoint was cost reduction. Period-end variable costs were favorable $670 million versus a year ago. And that just brings up the point here that we've been really focused on execution. That includes the cost reduction, but is not exclusively cost reduction. I mean, we've improved our market position as well in -- around the word, and in particular, in China as well. 
So let's switch onto the next page, Page 5. It's a discussion of sales and revenues. Again, the biggest sales decline in the quarter was in Energy & Transportation, just shy of $1 billion. We've been talking about this for the last year or so. The decline really started about midyear last year. So this second quarter is kind of the last, I think, of the big declines that we're going to see, particularly related to oil. First to first, second to second. By the time we got to the third quarter, and certainly by the time we got to the fourth quarter of last year, it was pretty much all baked in. In fact, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, the comps will be a lot more like the prior year. So this should be the last quarter of declines in -- at least in this size. 
Resource Industries down about $600 million. And most of that decline was lower end-user demand and a little bit from pricing. I mean, mining is just -- continued to be a very challenged industry. Customers are pushing out replacement purchases. They're delaying as much repair as they can. And we see that in our sales. 
Now relative to kind of the trend, it's about flat with where we were in the first quarter. So no continuing deterioration from where we were last quarter, but down from a year ago. 
And then finally, Construction Industries, down just under $400 million. A little more than half of the decline was price realization, and it is a pretty tough pricing environment out there today in construction. And we see it everywhere. We see it in the U.S. We see it outside the U.S. 
Now a word about this, because I know it may seem to you like it's accelerating, but it's kind of not. It's started going up about midyear last year, the sales variance, the discounting. And so we had negatives in the second half of last year. The first half of this year is comparing with a better period a year ago. So it looks like it's quite a bit of an increase. But it's not much of an increase actually from where we've been over the last 2 or 3 quarters. And I think as we go on and talk about this in the outlook, we kind of see it starting to flatten out. 
Sales were down in North America, Latin America. Europe, Africa and Middle East was pretty flat year-over-year. Europe up; Africa, Middle East down. And sales in Asia were actually up year-over-year despite price pressure. 
So that's a quick run through of sales. I know related to Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of concern around the turbine business, because it's been pretty strong for quite some time. Our -- just a couple of facts about that. We reported on the backlog last quarter, said it was up slightly from year-end. Second quarter of this year is about spot-on, where we were at the end of the quarter. So we're not seeing any deterioration there. It's a little early to talk about 2017, but all indications are the year is progressing pretty well. 
Oil is lower. Work backlog, sales around natural gas and natural gas pipelines are still pretty strong. Okay. So that's sales. 
Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk a little bit about the operating profit change and cost in particular. So this is the waterfall chart that we have actually in the release. No big new information on here outside of the release. It just highlights how well we've done on cost reduction. So in total, between variable and period, or you might call relatively fixed cost, we're down about $670 million. And that's gone a long way to offset the impact of lower volume and product mix. And you can see on here price realization, the negative $233 million. And actually, we've had more variable cost reduction, if you think material costs and efficiency and that type of thing. We've about offset the impact on price realization with that. 
So year-to-date, if we turn to the next page, just talk a little bit about what we've done on costs. So on the first quarter, between period costs and variable costs, we were down just under $0.5 billion. This quarter again was $670 million. So through the first half of the year, we've taken over $1.1 billion of cost out. If you look up at the top of this page, in the yellow bubble up there, what we're saying is we're on track, our expectations are that we'll get -- we'll end this year with well over $2 billion of cost reduction. That's coming really in 3 sort of general buckets. The most significant is restructuring, and that is everything from combining office functions and reducing people to taking out manufacturing floor space and related costs. Material costs have also been favorable. And we've had a good track record on material costs over the past few years. I mean, we're down over $1 billion over the last few years. And it really comes from mostly design and sourcing-related cost reduction, and then important, but to a lesser degree, commodity-related cost reduction. And then everything else. It's everything from a bit lower short-term incentive pay based on lower results and then cost reductions throughout the company, every place we can find it, from -- everything from travel and entertainment expense to consulting spend. So wherever we can take money out, we're working really hard to do that. 
So bottom line, we're investing in the things we need to for the future, things like digital and really important product programs. Everything else, we're really trying to put a lid on and cut where we can. And the results have actually been pretty good. 
So let's flip over to the next page, that would be Page 8, talk a little bit about the outlook for the year. When we were sitting here a quarter ago, we were expecting sales in a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So $41 billion as a midpoint. We've taken that down about -- from midpoint to midpoint, about $0.75 billion. And the gist of that is just everything that we're seeing in the economy today around the world, additional risk, everything from the results of the Brexit vote and the short-term uncertainties that causes the trouble we've seen in Turkey, all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections, oil prices have come off a little over the last couple of months. It's not any one thing, I would say. It's -- and we've said this in the outlook. We have sluggish economic growth throughout the world in general, but not enough to drive growth in our end markets. And the news we've seen over the last few months is definitely not giving us more confidence. 
So the outlook for profit is $2.75 a share, and that's all in, excluding restructuring costs, which are going to be about $700 million now this year. Net of that, we're at about 300 -- or $3, I'm sorry -- $3.55 a share. And both on the top line and bottom line, our estimate is actually pretty close to the last consensus analyst estimates that we've seen. So we're pretty close to we think where the market is. 
Now one point about this outlook, and this is on -- in Q&A 11 in our release on Page 15. It has been negatively affected about $0.08 a share by taxes. So we hadn't made the change in how we're looking at taxes on our profit excluding restructuring cost. The outlook would have been $0.08 higher, which isn't too bad of performance considering $750 million decline in the top line. And I think it just goes back to the main theme of execution, cost reduction, doing everything we possibly can to keep the company strong and give us the ability to invest in the future. 
One last point I'll make about sales, and this might well be on your minds as well, and that's kind of the status of dealer inventory. We're pretty flat right now in dealer inventory with the year-end last year, but we think it's going to come down quite a bit over the next 2 quarters. And that's not entirely unusual. Last year, we had a reduction as well. Full year reduction in dealer inventory this year is probably going to be not quite, but close to double what we did last year. And it's not so much -- and you've asked this question before, ""Do we have a glut of inventory?"" And I certainly would not describe it as that. I think one of the things that's happening out there is a little bit of our own doing, and it's around lean. If you look at our delivery performance and the stability of our delivery performance dealers, it's actually improved quite a bit over the last 5 years. We're at a point now where dealers, we think, have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver what they need and when they need it. And we think that's causing them to both order less. So as our delivery times have come down in construction, our backlog comes down a little. I mean, think of it this way. It's an oversimplified example. But if we had delivery times that were 1 day, we wouldn't have much backlog. Dealers would order, and we would ship it. So I think one of the reasons that construction backlog is a little lower and one of the reasons that we're getting probably more aggressive dealer inventory declines is how well we're performing on Lean relative to delivery performance. We knew that was likely to happen in the scheme of things. It's a good thing. 
So let's move on to the next -- the outlook. Let's move on to the next page, and that's -- I think it's probably a good time to talk about first half versus second half. We're through half of the year. Probably time to reflect a little bit on how the second half of the year is likely to shape up. End-user demand should be a fair bit higher than the first half of the year. I mean, we have our sales, which we think are going to be $600 million to $700 million higher than the first half. And that does include some substantial dealer inventory reduction. And we have profit per share, excluding restructuring cost, up $0.09. With restructuring, it's down a little, and that's because of the extra cost for restructuring in the back half. 
So if you look at how the sales shape up, that 65 -- that $6.5 billion -- $0.65 billion increase in sales, Construction Industries is likely to be down a little bit. End-user demand, pretty flat. But because of dealer inventory reductions, their sales are likely to be a bit down. That's our forecast anyway. Resource Industries, just slightly up from the first half run rate and not a lot. No big changes there in terms of trends. And then Energy & Transportation is responsible essentially for the increase in sales. And that's a -- that is mostly seasonal pattern on some of the big project kind of sales that we have. Turbines, for example. And we expect a bit more sales out of rail in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of profit, we have the $0.09 a share, better profit in the second half of the year than the first half. And the higher sales volume is the most significant reason for that. 
Pricing. Let's talk about this, and I touched on it a minute ago. We -- on a year-over-year basis, the negative impact of pricing ought to start easing a little bit. And that's because -- no, we really saw a kick-up midyear last year. And first half versus second half though, forget about last year, we don't see much change in the pricing environment. 
Inventory cost absorption will be modest negative in the back half of the year. We're looking at taking inventory down $500 million, $600 million -- our own inventory, not dealer inventory, down $500 million, $600 million in the back half of the year. It'll be a little hit to profit, but positive for cash flow. We'll also -- we also had some sale of security gains in the second quarter for financial services division and for the insurance portion of that. And we're not expecting that to repeat in the second half. 
Cost overall, we think, will be fairly neutral first half to second half. We do have additional period cost reduction that we're looking at in the second half of the year, but with kind of low seasonal cost in the first quarter and probably a little bit of efficiency negative, production is going to come down because of the decline in dealer inventory. We think those will come close to offsetting during the second half of the year. 
Now we don't actually have an outlook for the third quarter. But if you think about the second half of the year, in a lot of ways, I think it will look similar to the first half of the year. And if you think to the first half of the year, we had a low first quarter and a pretty good second quarter. And I think, as we look at the rest of the year, the third and fourth quarter will play out similarly. We'll have probably a weak third quarter and a much better fourth quarter. Again, a lot of that is the timing of some of this E&T sales around larger projects. So we're thinking that third quarter will probably be $400 million, $500 million in sales better than the first quarter, and profit will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 a share better than the first quarter. And then the fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Sales slightly higher, profit about the same as Q2. So that's how we think the rest of the year will shape up. 
So let's move on to the last slide that I'm going to cover today. That's Slide 10, and that's kind of key discussion points. Just a little quick recap of much of what I've talked about. On balance, there's not much change in demand from the industries that we're serving. Construction demand is relatively steady, but with continuing price pressure. We have no clear signs of recovery in mining or oil and gas or rail, for that matter. Good operational performance continues. Overall, our market position has improved. And that's been a continuing story for most of the last 5 years. Our decremental margins are pretty good and better than our target range. And that's despite a pretty negative sales mix, second quarter to second quarter. Cost reduction is substantial at $1.1 billion year-to-date, and we're thinking over $2 billion for the full year. We're on track with our restructuring actions. They have contributed to cost reduction this year, and that will contribute to more in 2017. And then finally, our balance sheet is strong. And that's very important to us because maintaining our credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities for us. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio for our machinery -- machining engines for Energy & Transportation business was 39%, about 21 net of about $6.8 billion of cash that we had on hand at the end of the quarter. 
So that's a wrap-up. We're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call."

So we've had good cost reduction during the first half of the year for material. And our view is, we'll continue to have cost reduction in the second half of the year versus 2015. But commodity prices have come up a little. So we're probably going to have less than the first half of the year. So in other words, full year, even second half versus the second half of last year positive, but the positiveness is probably peaked. And it will probably go down a little bit in the second half of the year. So that is one of the reasons, I think, that second half profitability. That, plus the inventory declines, plus the absence of the sort of $0.04 we got on the security sale in the second quarter, all kind of make it look like it doesn't hang together first half and second half of sales."

So going from above 60 down to 40, we've been absolutely trying to stay ahead of the process to be prepared, if things did not get better. If we were not staying ahead, quite frankly, there is no way we could have done $2 billion of cost reduction this year to offset some of the price pressures and the drop in volume. And we really like our mid-cycle numbers. Everybody wants to know when we're going to start recovering in that trend towards mid-cycle, but we still need to be prepared for what could happen in the next -- in the short term on the downside. And so we've talked about kind of 25% to 30% decremental. I would say we're still committed to that. I would also say that we're being extremely directive in the things that we fund, things like digital, which will be up significantly this year over the last year, things like funding the businesses that we believe have the highest opportunity to improve the value of the company and it -- and our operating profit after capital charge, which we call OPACC in the medium term. So we want to fund those industries, which we think are attractive for us and where we play well. And things that are not as attractive are the places that we look first to cut.

So again, if we were able to cut delivery performance in half from where it's at now, dealers would feel comfortable holding less inventory. If our delivery -- if -- let's say things ticked up, orders ticked up, the market is heated up, and let's say we were -- we had trouble keeping up, that would concern dealers and they would order even more. They would want to hold even more. But just the opposite is happening right now. We have excellent delivery performance. They can get pretty much what they need when their customers need it. And so that's causing them to hold or want to hold less. And the more -- the better we do with Lean, the more that will probably be the case. So I would -- I'm trying to stress a point. I don't think dealer inventories are excessive. I mean, there's a reasonable range, but I think they will come down over the second half of the year."

So I -- I mean -- oil prices this morning, I guess, were in a $42-plus range. We're probably still ways away from that."

And we have grown our share there. But one thing I want to comment on, which we had a few questions come in on, there is pressure in the used equipment market. It's probably down 2% or 3% from the last quarter. It's probably down 5% to 10%, if you look from a year ago. We carry a little over $600 million of used equipment both from repossessions and residuals. Still pretty well behaved. We had a gain last year. We had a very small loss this quarter. And so we don't see any big issues in that regard. But I would tell you that, that is an area that does have some pressure and that we're watching, but it's, at this point, very well maintained."

So I would say that over the course of the past quarter, we're a little more negative on the world economy. And the Brexit, the Turkey, the elections, oil price. You name it. All of that contributes. And we're less bullish on second half sales because of that. And whatever impact that would have in the future, we're trying to get ahead of that with additional cost reduction. So I would say it's us trying to get ahead of the potential, not what we actually know and not specifically related to any one of those items."

And when you get the numbers, we're talking a change, quarter-to-quarter of a couple of hundred million, not for pricing, but in total for them. Costs were a little higher because of some inventory adjustments. Just kind of normal surplus and excess inventory. And then we had a little negative inventory absorption for RI. They took out inventory in the second quarter. That hurt a little bit. They are certainly a part of the extra cost reduction that we're going after in the second half of the year. When I talked a little bit about first half, second half, we think their sales are going to be up a little bit in the second half of the year.

I don't think it would move the needle a great deal, but we would certainly feel it. It's hard to quantify until states start lining up for their matching funds. So there's quite a big effort under way to get that done as well. So we'll just have to see it play out. It's certainly going to be a positive, but I would doubt we'd see it move the needle in a big way in '17. But we'd feel it."

So excluding restructuring, it will vary a little bit by quarter, depending upon how much restructuring there is, but probably around 27%, excluding restructuring. And then what's normal on incentive pay, I'm going to qualify it a little bit here. It depends on how many employees we have because it scales, if you look at it in terms of dollars. But based on the number of employees we have right now, if we were to pay everyone at a 1.0 payout, which we would consider to be normal in a normal year, you're looking at something in the order of magnitude of, let's say, a rough number, 8 50."

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And as usual, on the call with me this morning, we have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. 
Today, I'll start by walking you through a short slide deck, similar to what we've done over the past couple of quarters, and then we'll move on to the Q&A after that. 
So if you don't have the slide deck in front of you right now, it's available on our website, at caterpillar.com, in the Investors section. And it's where the webcast link was. 
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. And any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
If you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, discussions either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results to differ materially, can also be found in Cautionary Statements under Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can also be found in the financial release on our website and is also the back page of today's slide deck.
So with that, let's get started on the slide deck, and I would ask you to flip over to Page 4. It's the comparison of the second quarter 2016 with the second quarter of 2015. It has the key lines for the second quarter versus last year. Sales and revenues down about $2 billion. About half of that was Energy & Transportation, and the other half was split close to evenly between Resource Industries and Construction Industries. And I'll talk a little bit more about sales in a minute. 
And profit. The Primary drivers of the decline in profit from $1.31 to $0.93 a share this quarter, and excluding restructuring, $1.09, down from $1.40, so a $0.31 decline. 
By far, the biggest negative in the quarter was the decline in sales volume, and that included negative sales mix as more of the decline was in higher-margin products, like oil and gas. 
Price realization was also pretty a substantial negative in the quarter, and that was off $233 million. 
Now on the favorable side, below operating profit, other income and expense was a positive $156 million. And that was mostly all due to the absence of below operating profit exchange losses from a year ago. An important point, I think, to note about this second quarter was exchange had actually little impact on the quarter itself. 
And then the bottom, the most substantial positive in the quarter from a profit standpoint was cost reduction. Period and variable costs were favorable $670 million versus a year ago. And that just brings up the point here that we've been really focused on execution. That includes the cost reduction, but is not exclusively cost reduction. I mean, we've improved our market position as well in -- around the word, and in particular, in China as well. 
So let's switch onto the next page, Page 5. It's a discussion of sales and revenues. Again, the biggest sales decline in the quarter was in Energy & Transportation, just shy of $1 billion. We've been talking about this for the last year or so. The decline really started about midyear last year. So this second quarter is kind of the last, I think, of the big declines that we're going to see, particularly related to oil. First to first, second to second. By the time we got to the third quarter, and certainly by the time we got to the fourth quarter of last year, it was pretty much all baked in. In fact, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, the comps will be a lot more like the prior year. So this should be the last quarter of declines in -- at least in this size. 
Resource Industries down about $600 million. And most of that decline was lower end-user demand and a little bit from pricing. I mean, mining is just -- continued to be a very challenged industry. Customers are pushing out replacement purchases. They're delaying as much repair as they can. And we see that in our sales. 
Now relative to kind of the trend, it's about flat with where we were in the first quarter. So no continuing deterioration from where we were last quarter, but down from a year ago. 
And then finally, Construction Industries, down just under $400 million. A little more than half of the decline was price realization, and it is a pretty tough pricing environment out there today in construction. And we see it everywhere. We see it in the U.S. We see it outside the U.S. 
Now a word about this, because I know it may seem to you like it's accelerating, but it's kind of not. It started going up about midyear last year; the sales variance, the discounting. And so we had negatives in the second half of last year. The first half of this year is comparing with a better period a year ago. So it looks like it's quite a bit of an increase. But it's not much of an increase actually from where we've been over the last 2 or 3 quarters. And I think as we go on and talk about this in the outlook, we kind of see it starting to flatten out. 
Sales were down in North America, Latin America. Europe, Africa and Middle East was pretty flat year-over-year. Europe up; Africa, Middle East down. And sales in Asia were actually up year-over-year despite price pressure. 
So that's a quick run through of sales. I know related to Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of concern around the turbine business, because it's been pretty strong for quite some time. Our -- just a couple of facts about that. We reported on the backlog last quarter, said it was up slightly from year-end. Second quarter of this year is about spot-on, where we were at the end of the quarter. So we're not seeing any deterioration there. It's a little early to talk about 2017, but all indications are the year is progressing pretty well. 
Oil is lower. Work backlog, sales around natural gas and natural gas pipelines are still pretty strong. Okay. So that's sales. 
Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk a little bit about the operating profit change and cost in particular. So this is the waterfall chart that we have actually in the release. No big new information on here outside of the release. It just highlights how well we've done on cost reduction. So in total, between variable and period, or you might call relatively fixed cost, we're down about $670 million. And that's gone a long way to offset the impact of lower volume and product mix. And you can see on here price realization, the negative $233 million. And actually, we've had more variable cost reduction, if you think material costs and efficiency and that type of thing. We've about offset the impact on price realization with that. 
So year-to-date, if we turn to the next page, just talk a little bit about what we've done on costs. So on the first quarter, between period costs and variable costs, we were down just under $0.5 billion. This quarter again was $670 million. So through the first half of the year, we've taken over $1.1 billion of cost out. If you look up at the top of this page, in the yellow bubble up there, what we're saying is we're on track, our expectations are that we'll get -- we'll end this year with well over $2 billion of cost reduction. And that's coming really in 3 sort of general buckets. The most significant is restructuring, and that is everything from combining office functions and reducing people to taking out manufacturing floor space and related costs. Material costs have also been favorable. And we've had a good track record on material costs over the past few years. I mean, we're down over $1 billion over the last few years. And it really comes from mostly design and sourcing-related cost reduction, and then important, but to a lesser degree, commodity-related cost reduction. And then everything else. It's everything from a bit lower short-term incentive pay based on lower results and then cost reductions throughout the company, every place we can find it, from -- everything from travel and entertainment expense to consulting spend. So wherever we can take money out, we're working really hard to do that. 
So bottom line, we're investing in the things we need to for the future, things like digital and really important product programs. Everything else, we're really trying to put a lid on and cut where we can. And the results have actually been pretty good. 
So let's flip over to the next page, that would be Page 8, talk a little bit about the outlook for the year. When we were sitting here a quarter ago, we were expecting sales in a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So $41 billion as a midpoint. We've taken that down about -- from midpoint to midpoint, about $0.75 billion. And the gist of that is just everything that we're seeing in the economy today around the world, additional risk, everything from the results of the Brexit vote and the short-term uncertainties that causes, the trouble we've seen in Turkey, all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections, oil prices have come off a little over the last couple of months. It's not any one thing, I would say. It's -- and we've said this in the outlook. We have sluggish economic growth throughout the world in general, but not enough to drive growth in our end markets. And the news we've seen over the last few months is definitely not giving us more confidence. 
So the outlook for profit is $2.75 a share, and that's all in, excluding restructuring costs, which are going to be about $700 million now this year. Net of that, we're at about 300 -- or $3, I'm sorry -- $3.55 a share. And both on the top line and bottom line, our estimate is actually pretty close to the last consensus analyst estimates that we've seen. So we're pretty close to we think where the market is. 
Now one point about this outlook, and this is on -- in Q&A 11 in our release on Page 15. It has been negatively affected about $0.08 a share by taxes. So we hadn't made the change in how we're looking at taxes on our profit excluding restructuring cost. The outlook would have been $0.08 higher, which isn't too bad of performance considering $750 million decline in the top line. And I think it just goes back to the main theme of execution, cost reduction, doing everything we possibly can to keep the company strong and give us the ability to invest in the future. 
One last point I'll make about sales, and this might well be on your minds as well, and that's kind of the status of dealer inventory. We're pretty flat right now in dealer inventory with the year-end last year, but we think it's going to come down quite a bit over the next 2 quarters. And that's not entirely unusual. Last year, we had a reduction as well. Full year reduction in dealer inventory this year is probably going to be, not quite, but close to double what we did last year. And it's not so much -- and you've asked this question before, ""Do we have a glut of inventory?"" And I certainly would not describe it as that. I think one of the things that's happening out there is a little bit of our own doing, and it's around Lean. If you look at our delivery performance and the stability of our delivery performance dealers, it's actually improved quite a bit over the last 5 years. We're at a point now where dealers, we think, have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver what they need and when they need it. And we think that's causing them to both order less -- so as our delivery times have come down in construction, our backlog comes down a little. I mean, think of it this way. This is an oversimplified example. But if we had delivery times that were one day, we wouldn't have much backlog. Dealers would order, and we would ship it. So I think one of the reasons that construction backlog is a little lower and one of the reasons that we're getting probably more aggressive dealer inventory declines is how well we're performing on Lean relative to delivery performance. We knew that was likely to happen in the scheme of things. It's a good thing. 
So let's move on to the next -- the outlook. Let's move on to the next page, and that's -- I think it's probably a good time to talk about first half versus second half. We're through half of the year. Probably time to reflect a little bit on how the second half of the year is likely to shape up. End-user demand should be a fair bit higher than the first half of the year. I mean, we have our sales, which we think are going to be $600 million to $700 million higher than the first half. And that does include some substantial dealer inventory reduction. And we have profit per share, excluding restructuring cost, up $0.09. With restructuring, it's down a little, and that's because of the extra cost for restructuring in the back half. 
So if you look at how the sales shape up, that 65 -- that $6.5 billion -- $0.65 billion increase in sales, Construction Industries is likely to be down a little bit. End-user demand, pretty flat. But because of dealer inventory reductions, their sales are likely to be a bit down. That's our forecast anyway. Resource Industries, just slightly up from the first half run rate and not a lot. No big changes there in terms of trends. And then Energy & Transportation is responsible essentially for the increase in sales. And that's a -- that is mostly seasonal pattern on some of the big project kind of sales that we have. Turbines, for example. And we expect a bit more sales out of rail in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of profit, we have the $0.09 a share, better profit in the second half of the year than the first half. And the higher sales volume is the most significant reason for that. 
Pricing. Let's talk about this, and I touched on it a minute ago. We -- on a year-over-year basis, the negative impact of pricing ought to start easing a little bit. And that's because we really saw a kick-up midyear last year. And first half versus second half though, forget about last year, we don't see much change in the pricing environment. 
Inventory cost absorption will be modest negative in the back half of the year. We're looking at taking inventory down $500 million, $600 million -- our own inventory, not dealer inventory, down $500 million, $600 million in the back half of the year. It'll be a little hit to profit, but positive for cash flow. We'll also -- we also had some sale of security gains in the second quarter for financial services division and for the insurance portion of that. And we're not expecting that to repeat in the second half. 
Cost overall, we think, will be fairly neutral first half to second half. We do have additional period cost reduction that we're looking at in the second half of the year, but with kind of low seasonal cost in the first quarter and probably a little bit of efficiency negative, production is going to come down because of the decline in dealer inventory. We think those will come close to offsetting during the second half of the year. 
Now we don't actually have an outlook for the third quarter. But if you think about the second half of the year, in a lot of ways, I think it will look similar to the first half of the year. And if you think to the first half of the year, we had a low first quarter and a pretty good second quarter. And I think, as we look at the rest of the year, the third and fourth quarter will play out similarly. We'll have probably a weak third quarter and a much better fourth quarter. Again, a lot of that is the timing of some of this E&T sales around larger projects. So we're thinking that third quarter will probably be $400 million, $500 million in sales better than the first quarter, and profit will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 a share better than the first quarter. And then the fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Sales slightly higher, profit about the same as Q2. So that's how we think the rest of the year will shape up. 
So let's move on to the last slide that I'm going to cover today. That's Slide 10, and that's kind of key discussion points. Just a little quick recap of much of what I've talked about. On balance, there's not much change in demand from the industries that we're serving. Construction demand is relatively steady, but with continuing price pressure. We have no clear signs of recovery in mining or oil and gas, or rail for that matter. Good operational performance continues. Overall, our market position has improved. And that's been a continuing story for most of the last 5 years. Our decremental margins are pretty good and better than our target range. And that's despite a pretty negative sales mix, second quarter to second quarter. Cost reduction is substantial at $1.1 billion year-to-date, and we're thinking over $2 billion for the full year. We're on track with our restructuring actions. They have contributed to cost reduction this year, and that will contribute to more in 2017. And then finally, our balance sheet is strong. And that's very important to us because maintaining our credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities for us. 
In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio for our machinery -- machining engines or Energy & Transportation business was 39%, about 21 net of about $6.8 billion of cash that we had on hand at the end of the quarter. 
So that's a wrap-up. We're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call."

The trough earnings number has been stated between $2.50 and $3.50. I'd say, if you look at how -- and I would say the sales decline modeled in those scenarios would not have been as severe as what we've experienced in the 4-year trend. So going from above 60 down to 40, we've been absolutely trying to stay ahead of the process, to be prepared if things did not get better. If we were not staying ahead, quite frankly, there is no way we could have done $2 billion of cost reduction this year to offset some of the price pressures and the drop in volume. And we really like our mid-cycle numbers. Everybody wants to know when we're going to start recovering in that trend towards mid-cycle, but we still need to be prepared for what could happen in the short term on the downside. And so we've talked about kind of 25% to 30% decremental. I would say we're still committed to that. I would also say that we're being extremely directive in the things that we fund; things like digital, which will be up significantly this year over the last year; things like funding the businesses that we believe have the highest opportunity to improve the value of the company and it -- and our operating profit after capital charge, which we call OPACC in the medium term. So we want to fund those industries, which we think are attractive for us and where we play well. And things that are not as attractive are the places that we look first to cut. So we're still in that process, and we're still preparing to stay ahead of the game. And I would say that, if required, we would be ready."

And in terms of adequate levels, I mean, I've tried to address this point. I think adequate levels is a little bit of a moving target around delivery performance. So again, if we were able to cut delivery performance in half from where it's at now, dealers would feel comfortable holding less inventory. If our delivery -- if -- let's say things ticked up, orders ticked up, the markets heated up, and let's say we were -- we had trouble keeping up, that would concern dealers and they would order even more. They would want to hold even more. But just the opposite is happening right now. We have excellent delivery performance. They can get pretty much what they need when their customers need it. And so that's causing them to hold or want to hold less. And the more -- the better we do with Lean, the more that will probably be the case. So I would -- I'm trying to stress a point. I don't think dealer inventories are excessive. I mean, there's a reasonable range, but I think they will come down over the second half of the year."

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services. And as usual, on the call with me this morning, we have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. 
Today, I'll start by walking you through a short slide deck, similar to what we've done over the past couple of quarters, and then we'll move on to the Q&A after that. 
So if you don't have the slide deck in front of you right now, it's available on our website, at caterpillar.com, in the Investors section. And it's where the webcast link was. 
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. And any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website. And it'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast. 
If you go to Page 2 of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, discussions either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results to differ materially, can also be found in Cautionary Statements under Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release. 
In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can also be found in the financial release on our website and is also the back page of today's slide deck.
So with that, let's get started on the slide deck, and I would ask you to flip over to Page 4. It's the comparison of the second quarter 2016 with the second quarter of 2015. It has the key lines for the second quarter versus last year. Sales and revenues down about $2 billion. About half of that was Energy & Transportation, and the other half was split close to evenly between Resource Industries and Construction Industries. And I'll talk a little bit more about sales in a minute. 
And profit. The Primary drivers of the decline in profit from $1.31 to $0.93 a share this quarter, and excluding restructuring, $1.09, down from $1.40, so a $0.31 decline. 
By far, the biggest negative in the quarter was the decline in sales volume, and that included negative sales mix as more of the decline was in higher-margin products, like oil and gas. 
Price realization was also pretty a substantial negative in the quarter, and that was off $233 million. 
Now on the favorable side, below operating profit, other income and expense was a positive $156 million. And that was mostly all due to the absence of below operating profit exchange losses from a year ago. An important point, I think, to note about this second quarter was exchange had actually little impact on the quarter itself. 
And then the bottom, the most substantial positive in the quarter from a profit standpoint was cost reduction. Period and variable costs were favorable $670 million versus a year ago. And that just brings up the point here that we've been really focused on execution. That includes the cost reduction, but is not exclusively cost reduction. I mean, we've improved our market position as well in -- around the word, and in particular, in China as well. 
So let's switch onto the next page, Page 5. It's a discussion of sales and revenues. Again, the biggest sales decline in the quarter was in Energy & Transportation, just shy of $1 billion. We've been talking about this for the last year or so. The decline really started about midyear last year. So this second quarter is kind of the last, I think, of the big declines that we're going to see, particularly related to oil. First to first, second to second. By the time we got to the third quarter, and certainly by the time we got to the fourth quarter of last year, it was pretty much all baked in. In fact, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, the comps will be a lot more like the prior year. So this should be the last quarter of declines in -- at least in this size. 
Resource Industries down about $600 million. And most of that decline was lower end-user demand and a little bit from pricing. I mean, mining is just -- continued to be a very challenged industry. Customers are pushing out replacement purchases. They're delaying as much repair as they can. And we see that in our sales. 
Now relative to kind of the trend, it's about flat with where we were in the first quarter. So no continuing deterioration from where we were last quarter, but down from a year ago. 
And then finally, Construction Industries, down just under $400 million. A little more than half of the decline was price realization, and it is a pretty tough pricing environment out there today in construction. And we see it everywhere. We see it in the U.S. We see it outside the U.S. 
Now a word about this, because I know it may seem to you like it's accelerating, but it's kind of not. It started going up about midyear last year; the sales variance, the discounting. And so we had negatives in the second half of last year. The first half of this year is comparing with a better period a year ago. So it looks like it's quite a bit of an increase. But it's not much of an increase actually from where we've been over the last 2 or 3 quarters. And I think as we go on and talk about this in the outlook, we kind of see it starting to flatten out. 
Sales were down in North America, Latin America. Europe, Africa and Middle East was pretty flat year-over-year. Europe up; Africa, Middle East down. And sales in Asia were actually up year-over-year despite price pressure. 
So that's a quick run through of sales. I know related to Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of concern around the turbine business, because it's been pretty strong for quite some time. Our -- just a couple of facts about that. We reported on the backlog last quarter, said it was up slightly from year-end. Second quarter of this year is about spot-on, where we were at the end of the quarter. So we're not seeing any deterioration there. It's a little early to talk about 2017, but all indications are the year is progressing pretty well. 
Oil is lower. Work backlog, sales around natural gas and natural gas pipelines are still pretty strong. Okay. So that's sales. 
Let's flip over to Page 6 and talk a little bit about the operating profit change and cost in particular. So this is the waterfall chart that we have actually in the release. No big new information on here outside of the release. It just highlights how well we've done on cost reduction. So in total, between variable and period, or you might call relatively fixed cost, we're down about $670 million. And that's gone a long way to offset the impact of lower volume and product mix. And you can see on here price realization, the negative $233 million. And actually, we've had more variable cost reduction, if you think material costs and efficiency and that type of thing. We've about offset the impact on price realization with that. 
So year-to-date, if we turn to the next page, just talk a little bit about what we've done on costs. So on the first quarter, between period costs and variable costs, we were down just under $0.5 billion. This quarter again was $670 million. So through the first half of the year, we've taken over $1.1 billion of cost out. If you look up at the top of this page, in the yellow bubble up there, what we're saying is we're on track, our expectations are that we'll get -- we'll end this year with well over $2 billion of cost reduction. And that's coming really in 3 sort of general buckets. The most significant is restructuring, and that is everything from combining office functions and reducing people to taking out manufacturing floor space and related costs. Material costs have also been favorable. And we've had a good track record on material costs over the past few years. I mean, we're down over $1 billion over the last few years. And it really comes from mostly design and sourcing-related cost reduction, and then important, but to a lesser degree, commodity-related cost reduction. And then everything else. It's everything from a bit lower short-term incentive pay based on lower results and then cost reductions throughout the company, every place we can find it, from -- everything from travel and entertainment expense to consulting spend. So wherever we can take money out, we're working really hard to do that. 
So bottom line, we're investing in the things we need to for the future, things like digital and really important product programs. Everything else, we're really trying to put a lid on and cut where we can. And the results have actually been pretty good. 
So let's flip over to the next page, that would be Page 8, talk a little bit about the outlook for the year. When we were sitting here a quarter ago, we were expecting sales in a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So $41 billion as a midpoint. We've taken that down about -- from midpoint to midpoint, about $0.75 billion. And the gist of that is just everything that we're seeing in the economy today around the world, additional risk, everything from the results of the Brexit vote and the short-term uncertainties that causes, the trouble we've seen in Turkey, all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections, oil prices have come off a little over the last couple of months. It's not any one thing, I would say. It's -- and we've said this in the outlook. We have sluggish economic growth throughout the world in general, but not enough to drive growth in our end markets. And the news we've seen over the last few months is definitely not giving us more confidence. 
So the outlook for profit is $2.75 a share, and that's all in, excluding restructuring costs, which are going to be about $700 million now this year. Net of that, we're at about 300 -- or $3, I'm sorry -- $3.55 a share. And both on the top line and bottom line, our estimate is actually pretty close to the last consensus analyst estimates that we've seen. So we're pretty close to we think where the market is. 
Now one point about this outlook, and this is on -- in Q&A 11 in our release on Page 15. It has been negatively affected about $0.08 a share by taxes. So we hadn't made the change in how we're looking at taxes on our profit excluding restructuring cost. The outlook would have been $0.08 higher, which isn't too bad of performance considering $750 million decline in the top line. And I think it just goes back to the main theme of execution, cost reduction, doing everything we possibly can to keep the company strong and give us the ability to invest in the future. 
One last point I'll make about sales, and this might well be on your minds as well, and that's kind of the status of dealer inventory. We're pretty flat right now in dealer inventory with the year-end last year, but we think it's going to come down quite a bit over the next 2 quarters. And that's not entirely unusual. Last year, we had a reduction as well. Full year reduction in dealer inventory this year is probably going to be, not quite, but close to double what we did last year. And it's not so much -- and you've asked this question before, ""Do we have a glut of inventory?"" And I certainly would not describe it as that. I think one of the things that's happening out there is a little bit of our own doing, and it's around Lean. If you look at our delivery performance and the stability of our delivery performance dealers, it's actually improved quite a bit over the last 5 years. We're at a point now where dealers, we think, have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver what they need and when they need it. And we think that's causing them to both order less -- so as our delivery times have come down in construction, our backlog comes down a little. I mean, think of it this way. This is an oversimplified example. But if we had delivery times that were one day, we wouldn't have much backlog. Dealers would order, and we would ship it. So I think one of the reasons that construction backlog is a little lower and one of the reasons that we're getting probably more aggressive dealer inventory declines is how well we're performing on Lean relative to delivery performance. We knew that was likely to happen in the scheme of things. It's a good thing. 
So let's move on to the next -- the outlook. Let's move on to the next page, and that's -- I think it's probably a good time to talk about first half versus second half. We're through half of the year. Probably time to reflect a little bit on how the second half of the year is likely to shape up. End-user demand should be a fair bit higher than the first half of the year. I mean, we have our sales, which we think are going to be $600 million to $700 million higher than the first half. And that does include some substantial dealer inventory reduction. And we have profit per share, excluding restructuring cost, up $0.09. With restructuring, it's down a little, and that's because of the extra cost for restructuring in the back half. 
So if you look at how the sales shape up, that 65 -- that $6.5 billion -- $0.65 billion increase in sales, Construction Industries is likely to be down a little bit. End-user demand, pretty flat. But because of dealer inventory reductions, their sales are likely to be a bit down. That's our forecast anyway. Resource Industries, just slightly up from the first half run rate and not a lot. No big changes there in terms of trends. And then Energy & Transportation is responsible essentially for the increase in sales. And that's a -- that is mostly seasonal pattern on some of the big project kind of sales that we have. Turbines, for example. And we expect a bit more sales out of rail in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of profit, we have the $0.09 a share, better profit in the second half of the year than the first half. And the higher sales volume is the most significant reason for that. 
Pricing. Let's talk about this, and I touched on it a minute ago. We -- on a year-over-year basis, the negative impact of pricing ought to start easing a little bit. And that's because we really saw a kick-up midyear last year. And first half versus second half though, forget about last year, we don't see much change in the pricing environment. 
Inventory cost absorption will be modest negative in the back half of the year. We're looking at taking inventory down $500 million, $600 million -- our own inventory, not dealer inventory, down $500 million, $600 million in the back half of the year. It'll be a little hit to profit, but positive for cash flow. We'll also -- we also had some sale of security gains in the second quarter for financial services division and for the insurance portion of that. And we're not expecting that to repeat in the second half. 
Cost overall, we think, will be fairly neutral first half to second half. We do have additional period cost reduction that we're looking at in the second half of the year, but with kind of low seasonal cost in the first quarter and probably a little bit of efficiency negative, production is going to come down because of the decline in dealer inventory. We think those will come close to offsetting during the second half of the year. 
Now we don't actually have an outlook for the third quarter. But if you think about the second half of the year, in a lot of ways, I think it will look similar to the first half of the year. And if you think to the first half of the year, we had a low first quarter and a pretty good second quarter. And I think, as we look at the rest of the year, the third and fourth quarter will play out similarly. We'll have probably a weak third quarter and a much better fourth quarter. Again, a lot of that is the timing of some of this E&T sales around larger projects. So we're thinking that third quarter will probably be $400 million, $500 million in sales better than the first quarter, and profit will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 a share better than the first quarter. And then the fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Sales slightly higher, profit about the same as Q2. So that's how we think the rest of the year will shape up. 
So let's move on to the last slide that I'm going to cover today. That's Slide 10, and that's kind of key discussion points. Just a little quick recap of much of what I've talked about. On balance, there's not much change in demand from the industries that we're serving. Construction demand is relatively steady, but with continuing price pressure. We have no clear signs of recovery in mining or oil and gas, or rail for that matter. Good operational performance continues. Overall, our market position has improved. And that's been a continuing story for most of the last 5 years. Our decremental margins are pretty good and better than our target range. And that's despite a pretty negative sales mix, second quarter to second quarter. Cost reduction is substantial at $1.1 billion year-to-date, and we're thinking over $2 billion for the full year. We're on track with our restructuring actions. They have contributed to cost reduction this year, and that will contribute to more in 2017. And then finally, our balance sheet is strong. And that's very important to us because maintaining our credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities for us. 
In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio for our machinery -- machining engines or Energy & Transportation business was 39%, about 21 net of about $6.8 billion of cash that we had on hand at the end of the quarter. 
So that's a wrap-up. We're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call."

So in other words, full year, even second half versus the second half of last year positive, but the positiveness is probably peaked. And it will probably go down a little bit in the second half of the year. So that is one of the reasons, I think, that second half profitability. That, plus the inventory declines, plus the absence of the sort of $0.04 we got on the security sale in the second quarter, all kind of make it look like it doesn't hang together first half and second half of sales."

I'd say, if you look at how -- and I would say the sales decline modeled in those scenarios would not have been as severe as what we've experienced in the 4-year trend. So going from above 60 down to 40, we've been absolutely trying to stay ahead of the process, to be prepared if things did not get better. If we were not staying ahead, quite frankly, there is no way we could have done $2 billion of cost reduction this year to offset some of the price pressures and the drop in volume. And we really like our mid-cycle numbers. Everybody wants to know when we're going to start recovering in that trend towards mid-cycle, but we still need to be prepared for what could happen in the short term on the downside. And so we've talked about kind of 25% to 30% decremental. I would say we're still committed to that. I would also say that we're being extremely directive in the things that we fund; things like digital, which will be up significantly this year over the last year; things like funding the businesses that we believe have the highest opportunity to improve the value of the company and it -- and our operating profit after capital charge, which we call OPACC in the medium term. So we want to fund those industries, which we think are attractive for us and where we play well. And things that are not as attractive are the places that we look first to cut.

So again, if we were able to cut delivery performance in half from where it's at now, dealers would feel comfortable holding less inventory. If our delivery -- if -- let's say things ticked up, orders ticked up, the markets heated up, and let's say we were -- we had trouble keeping up, that would concern dealers and they would order even more. They would want to hold even more. But just the opposite is happening right now. We have excellent delivery performance. They can get pretty much what they need when their customers need it. And so that's causing them to hold or want to hold less. And the more -- the better we do with Lean, the more that will probably be the case. So I would -- I'm trying to stress a point. I don't think dealer inventories are excessive. I mean, there's a reasonable range, but I think they will come down over the second half of the year."

And we have grown our share there. But one thing I want to comment on, which we had a few questions come in on, there is pressure in the used equipment market. It's probably down 2% or 3% from the last quarter. It's probably down 5% to 10%, if you look from a year ago. We carry a little over $600 million of used equipment both from repossessions and residuals. Still pretty well behaved. We had a gain last year. And we had a very small loss this quarter. And so we don't see any big issues in that regard. But I would tell you that, that is an area that does have some pressure and that we're watching, but it's, at this point, very well maintained."

Costs were a little higher because of some inventory adjustments. Just kind of normal surplus and excess inventory. And then we had a little negative inventory absorption for RI. They took out inventory in the second quarter. That hurt a little bit. They are certainly a part of the extra cost reduction that we're going after in the second half of the year. When I talked a little bit about first half, second half, we think their sales are going to be up a little bit in the second half of the year.

I think as most states have recovered from their fiscal problems the last few years, they're starting to recognize the needs for infrastructure. And we're seeing that. If there's any impact, and I've said this all year long, from that transportation act of last year, it's going to be a '17 event. We might feel it. I don't think it would move the needle a great deal, but we would certainly feel it. And It's hard to quantify until states start lining up for their matching funds. So there's quite a big effort under way to get that done as well. So we'll just have to see it play out. It's certainly going to be a positive, but I would doubt we'd see it move the needle in a big way in '17. But we'd feel it."

But based on the number of employees we have right now, if we were to pay everyone at a 1.0 payout, which we would consider to be normal in a normal year, you're looking at something in the order of magnitude of, let's say, rough number, 8 50."

And I just want to make a few opening comments, and I'll get back to -- we'll get back to Mike in [ph] a normal conference call stuff. 
I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning process that the board used, just make a few comments on that. We have a -- and [ph] we've talked about this before in analyst conferences and so on, but we have a very robust succession planning process that goes all the way down to almost the first levels of management. We review and spend a lot of time on that every year. And every year, at least once, usually in October, we go through that with the board for, let's say, [ph] the top 300 -- top 350 people and talk about succession, the future, some names. And then, during the year, we try to introduce the board to a lot of those names and individuals, as we have been doing. 
I certainly have been active in that. I was very adamant that I wanted, when my time was up, and I'll be 64 in February. When I retire at the end of March, I will be 64 years old, with just a few months to go before I'm 65. Pretty much right on the process. There's no drama here, contrary to a lot of the stuff that's going around. But I wanted to -- I was adamant with the board that I wanted a very good, sound process to use, that they were happy with it, our executive office team was happy with it at the end. And both the -- all the executive officers then would go right on through performance and not miss a beat. I think we've achieved that. I picked the timing. I've been very much supportive of Jim. I'm very much supportive of the full executive office. And as we announced a week ago yesterday, I will be CEO until the end of December, and I will be Executive Chairman until the end of March. But we did make a change in governance with a split chair and CEO role. I think most of you know we've had a shareholder proposal on that for several years in a row, and we have a couple of large shareholders that are fundamentally for that. They pushed that at transition times, and obviously, this was a time the board considered that because we were in transition. 
Dave Calhoun will be the Executive Chairman come April 1. I would tell you that I've had a wonderful relationship and extensive and also frequent with the current residing director, Ed Rust, and we talked frequently, before, during and after the -- every single board meeting, and have for years, since I've been on the job. David's role will not be anything different to [ph] Jim. Jim will run the company, and David will coordinate the board as Executive Chair. Just a change in governance. Both work very well. I've had great luck with the presiding director situation, and I'm sure Jim and Dave will have great luck with the split chair, CEO role as well. Again, no drama. Just a different way of doing things, and I think we'll carry on and not even miss a beat. 
So with that, little preamble, I will tell you I'm excited to move into the next phase. I'm very excited for Jim and the executive team that we have here. I feel the company's positioned. We've been through an awful rough period the last 4 years, as all of you have known and endured, but I do think we're set up for the future. So Mike, if you'd take over."

Just as a reminder, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting at the Investors section of that same caterpillar.com website, and it'll be in a section labeled Results Webcast. 
So if you go to Page 2 on this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements, and I am quite certain that, this morning, we're going to be discussing quite a bit of forward-looking information, and that always involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, [ph] a discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in aggregate, could make results differ can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is Risk Factors, from our Form 10-K filed with the SEC earlier this year and in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. 
Now in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that are used in both our financial release and this presentation can be found in both the financial release and the last page of the slide deck. 
One more thing, actually, before we get started on the slide deck. And I know that with Doug's announced retirement and with Jim replacing him, I suspect you have a lot of questions for Jim about his long-term strategy. But I would say, since Jim found out he's going to be CEO just about 10 days ago, now is probably not the best time for those kind of questions. So what we're going to ask is, today, we're going to try and keep the call here to our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and kind of our preliminary view of sales for next year. 
So with that, let's start on the slide deck, and if you could flip to Page 4. And on Page 4, that's a high-level summary of what happened in the third quarter to sales and profit -- sales and revenues and profit. So we were down $1.8 billion in the quarter, kind of continued on the same trajectory we've been most of the year. Profit per share dropped from $0.94 per share last year in the third quarter to $0.48 this quarter. Quite a bit of that was from more restructuring costs. Certainly, in the quarter, we had asset impairments -- additional asset impairments related to our Resource Industries business, and restructuring costs were $226 million higher than a year ago. If you exclude the restructuring costs, profit per share was down $0.20, which, I think, is pretty good performance on a $1.8 billion drop in sales. And that'll be a theme, I think, across the next few slides that we'll talk about. Cost reduction was very good. 
So if we go to the next page, it'll kind of walk us through the change in sales in a little bit more detail. So the most significant decline was in Energy & Transportation. We were down a little over $800 million. And transportation -- and in fact, this is, I think, the first time all year we've said that oil and gas was not the most significant reason. But this quarter, it was transportation, followed by power gen, oil and gas and industrial engines. 
Resource Industries was down $465 million. That's about -- that's a little over 25%, and it's been kind of down about in that range every quarter this year. So not a big change. And it's actually a split between mining products and large construction. We don't talk much about construction in Resource Industries, but we have large products like articulated trucks, some of the smaller off-highway trucks, some of the large bulldozers, some of the large wheel loaders are used in construction. And a pretty good decline this quarter in Resource Industries was from construction equipment, and we're seeing that -- quite a bit of that in North America. 
For the Construction Industries segment, we were down $521 million. And again, about 2/3 of that was volume, North America was the most significant region; and about 1/3 of that was price. So the total decline then is $1.8 billion. 
So let's maybe flip to the next slide, Page 6, talk a little bit about profit. And this is our normal waterfall chart. So on the left, the black bar is the third quarter operating profit from a year ago. And then we're isolating what caused changes. So you can see, without a doubt, that $1.8 billion decline in sales and revenues drove substantial impact on profit from lower volume. 
Price realization has remained pretty decent-sized negative, about the same as versus a year ago and [ph] last quarter. It was $213 million this quarter. The next 2 bars are the positives. Variable manufacturing costs, that's cost absorption, that's material cost, that's variable labor and overhead in our factories. And that's been positive for all year. Period costs, we've done a lot of work to take structural costs out of the company, and we've actually performed very well on this all year long. 
And then a couple of bars to the right is the restructuring cost. If you look at the decline in operating profit, about half of the decline was from the restructuring cost. So excluding restructuring costs, on the prior page, you saw we were down $0.20. It's a little over $200 million in operating profit. And if you look at that price realization bucket, had we not been in such a difficult pricing environment this quarter, we would have had enough variable and period cost reduction to essentially offset the impact of $1.8 billion in lower sales. 
Now I'm going to ask you to do something I normally wouldn't do at this time. Let's just back up, given that good cost performance. Let's back up to the previous page one more time. So when we look at Energy & Transportation, our sales were down $818 million, but the profit on that level of sales decline was only off $111 million. I think that indicates great cost performance. 
Construction Industries, $521 million decline in sales and revenues in -- and $165 million of that was price realization. Despite that, their profit was only down $28 million. 
Resource Industries, mining and large construction down $465 million in sales, but their profit was down only $35 million. So I think that -- when you look at the change in profit in the context with the change in sales, it just reinforces the point that I made a minute ago, that cost reduction has been very good so far this year. 
So if we move on to Page 7 and look at where we've been on cost reduction this year. You can see, through the first 9 months of the year, we're favorable about $1.8 billion. And that breaks down into 3 major categories. The first is restructuring efforts. We've been on that path for a few years. We announced a fairly big series of restructuring actions last September. And with all those actions, we've reduced square footage, capacity and people. Material cost has been favorable this year. And I know it's tempting to always think about that as just commodity-based, but the fact of the matter is, we've gotten more cost reduction from design- and sourcing-related changes than we have from commodity prices. And then there's everything else, and that includes short-term incentive pay. A little over $300 million of the $1.8 billion is from lower incentive pay this year, at least for [ph] our expectations. And -- so even without that, we're $1.5 billion of lower costs this year. 
So that's a little bit about the third quarter. Again, tough sales environment, very good progress on cost reduction across the board. 
So let's look at the outlook. We did lower the 2016 outlook. Previously, we were thinking $40 billion to $40.5 billion for the year and $2.75 profit per share, $3.55 without restructuring costs. Now we've lowered that. We think sales and revenues are going to be about $39 billion this year and profit will be $2.35 a share or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs. 
Now sales came down. So at the midpoint of the outlook, that's about $1.25 billion decline in sales, and that came out across -- relatively evenly across Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Now the decline for construction is [ph] particularly in North America, and the weakness in North American construction is impacted, both our Construction Industries segment and, to some degree, Resource Industries for large equipment. So I think -- that's one of the bigger reasons for the decline in the outlook. 
In Energy & Transportation, we also took down rail. We had some business that we thought was going to ship in the second half, and it's been pushed out to later years. And we've also had some decline in oil and gas, and that's mostly from service and overhaul work related to Solar. You always have a lot of questions about Solar. We were thinking Solar was going to be down about 10% this year. It looks like, based on where we're at now, it'll be closer to 15%, and most of that change is related to service and overhaul work, not new turbine sales. 
Power generation has also been down. It's been particularly weak in oil-producing regions. From a profit standpoint, our restructuring costs are about $100 million higher than we expect for the year, and most of that was from the additional asset write-offs that we had in Resource Industries in the third quarter. 
So we don't normally give quarterly guidance, but when we get to this point in the year, we have 3 quarters of actual, and we have a full year forecast. So it's pretty easy to figure out what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. And based on this outlook, it implies about $10 billion of sales and revenues, $0.47 a share profit and $0.67 excluding restructuring. 
If we move to the next page, Page 9, I'll kind of walk you through why, on higher sales, we think profit in the fourth quarter is going to be a bit lower. 
So if you look at the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter outlook, we have sales and revenues up about $800 million. Most all of that is in Energy & Transportation. We always have some seasonality in our fourth quarter sales, so this is probably not a surprise to you. We also have more locomotive shipments in the fourth quarter, particularly Tier 4 locomotives, and we have some large turnkey power generation projects in the fourth quarter. Profit on that higher sales, excluding the restructuring costs, we think, will be about $0.18 lower. And of course, one positive is higher volume. We do have a substantial offset of the higher volume on sales mix. And this is also not, I don't think, very unusual. Over the last couple of years, that's been the case for us. And we've had lower margins in the fourth quarter, and they've tended to rebound then in the first quarter. And we think that's likely the case here as well. 
Cost absorption, one of the things that also happens commonly with us is we -- and it's partly related to the higher sales, we have, usually, a pretty good-sized inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. We're expecting that again this year. And that, we think, will result in negative cost absorption. 
We had -- in the third quarter, because we lowered the outlook, we had a favorable kind of year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter for incentive compensation. We certainly don't expect that to repeat in the fourth quarter. So relative -- third to fourth is going to be negative for that. 
And then another item that we talk about quite a bit in the fourth quarter is a bit of seasonally higher costs at year-end, and we don't have any reason to believe this year will be any different than prior years. So we'd probably -- we expect a little bit of a cost increase in the fourth quarter. 
So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter. Now let's talk about 2017, and that's Page 10. Now we usually provide a preliminary view of next year in our third quarter release, and so we're doing that again this year. It's always difficult at this time of the year to predict that. It's -- the quarter doesn't even start for -- the year doesn't even start for a couple more months. But at this point in time, on balance, we're not expecting 2017 to be significantly different than '16. It doesn't mean that it couldn't be different. That just means, at this point in time, it's a little hard to predict. We have -- we try to give you some insight into our thinking here by providing a list of the positives and a list of the things that we're concerned about. And on the very first bullet, you'll see they're kind of the same thing, and that's commodity prices. So on the plus side, commodity prices have improved from earlier this year, and with -- like oil, for example, it seemed to stabilize somewhere around $50. And certainly, compared with where we were, that's good. That's a positive signal. On the concern side of that, we don't think commodity prices are still quite good enough to drive substantial sales increases next year. We would like to see commodity prices rise more next year. If that happens, that, we think, logically, would be upside for the second half of next year. If that doesn't happen, probably not upside then. On the positive side, construction in China, that's been generally positive this year. Both our market position -- we're doing a bit better than most of our competitors, and the market there is improved. And that's been good for us. If you look at today's release, for example, the one up sales increase that we have in our release is in construction in Asia. If memory serves me, we were up about 9% there. And we think as long as there's continued support for growth in China that next year can be up as well. Construction sales in some other developing countries, particularly in places like Brazil, where it's just been very, very challenging situation. CIS is in that category, too. Been a very, very challenging year for both Brazil because of deep recession. Russia, and actually, much of the Middle East as well because of low commodity prices. We kind of think that sales in many of these countries may have bottomed, and there's every opportunity to think that, in places like that, we could have some upside next year. 
Been around mining, and this is a bit related to the commodity comments earlier. It looks to us like the CapEx forecasts are flattening out, and sentiment amongst customers and dealers has been a little bit better. And that's good. On the concern side, in addition to commodity prices, North American construction over the last -- in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter is weaker than we would have thought a few months ago. And if that continues, that would be concerning next year as well. Hopefully, with all the election noise behind us, and particularly if we get some investment in U.S. infrastructure, that could help. But right now, I would think, on balance, it looks pretty tough. 
Economic growth in Europe, it's been kind of okay, but we're still concerned about Brexit. And as that draws nearer, the concerns that we have are -- does it impact economic growth and business confidence and investment? 
I think another fallout from the lower oil prices has been power gen, particularly in the oil-producing regions. It's very weak now, and we don't see anything in the short term that's going to change that around. 
And also kind of related to commodities in a way, Marine, particularly for offshore service vessels, we're concerned about. And rail remains very weak industry, particularly in North America. And industrial engine sales to ag customers, that's lose engine sales that we sell to ag customers and particularly ag and some power gen packagers remain pretty weak. 
I know with Solar it's always a topic of discussion. So I thought I would kind of give you the -- our current view of Solar as well. So right now, we've had a pretty stable backlog. Based on where it's at right now, it would give us expectations that Solar would be about flat next year with this year. I know you're concerned about how this will play out by segment, and I would tell you that it's not a lot. I mean, when we say not significantly different than '17, by and large, that's probably pretty similar across most of the segments. I would say probably slightly more negative with Energy & Transportation than, say, Resource Industries, which is at such a low bottom. I mean, new equipment sales in the big mining product is down 80% to 90% since 2012, not as much room there for downside. 
So with that, we'll just wrap up with a few discussion points on Page 11. Not much change over the past quarter in the industries we serve, with the exception of North American construction, which has -- which is disappointing. We've had great operational performance, and that's not just cost reduction. Our market position vis-à-vis our competitors was better this quarter than a year ago for raw machines and continues to improve in China. Our decrementals in every single segment were very good year-over-year. Cost reduction -- and that's driven by cost reduction, which is quite substantial. We're pretty well on track with restructuring. Most of the things that are of any magnitude that we were considering a year ago in September, with that announcement have been made public. Balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to -- our ME&T debt to cap is 37% at the end of the quarter. And we had a cash balance of over $6 billion, and we're still thinking that this year will be positive free cash flow. 
So with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for questions."

But we said this in the release, I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year, and we're -- the flattish for the year relies on a bit of improvement in the second half of the year. So I think, to your point on costs, I would suspect, as we wrap this up, we will be planning and trying to set a cost structure for something that's probably a little bit more conservative than what we're thinking sales for the year can be. So it will remain a very big focus on cost and cost reduction. Won't get into too many of the details yet. As you know, we're kind of in the middle of our planning process for next year right now. But I think some big things that you could certainly expect, one, we'll have a big headwind. I don't know how much yet, but we'll likely have a pretty sizable headwind on incentive compensation. This year, we're pretty -- we're off of our outlook in most areas, off of our plan. So we'll have less-than-expected short-term incentive comps this year for all of our employees. And something more normal going into next year could be a headwind of $500 million, $600 million, depending upon where the executive team and the board sets the target. So that would be a headwind. On the positive side, we've done very well on costs. We've taken out more costs as we've gone along this year. So we'll have some benefits from carryover impact of that. So that should be a tailwind. We've done very well on material costs. And again, much of the commodity benefit and material costs, with the rise in commodity prices, has come out. But even without commodity changes, we've done very well on sourcing and design with material cost. So I think we would see that as a tailwind for next year. So we're still working on all the other items in the plan. And when we get to January, we'll definitely do a more complete review of sales and the profit drivers."

I -- predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter, and this will be a plus or minus, probably a couple of hundred million dollars, but probably something around -- dealer inventory, in its totality, around $1.5 billion decline this year with probably somewhere close to half of that coming out in the fourth quarter of this year. So we are not currently producing to end-market demand. This year, let's say, order of magnitude, $1.5 billion lower. Now when you start talking about next year. I'll tell you what makes it really difficult to predict. It depends a lot how we'll end the year, depends a lot on how the second half of the year turns out and what expectations for 2018 are. So for example, if things start improving in the middle of next year and there's confidence that 2018 is going to be a better year, part of dealer inventory is thinking about what's going to be needed for the future, not what was needed in the past. So that would tend to help dealer inventory. If 2018 looks bad, if there's some sort of a world event and dealers are more pessimistic, there would likely be some additional dealer inventory reduction. I think it -- I think we'll probably be in a better position to talk about that maybe more in January, but I would say, in our current estimates, we do continue to have some level of dealer inventory reduction in for next year. I guess, at this point, let's just call it a placeholder, but probably not as much as this year."

So I think, naturally, they're ordering less. We would certainly expect a pickup in orders in the first quarter as they want to build some inventory for the second quarter selling season. In the case of Solar, backlog is reasonable. And based on everything we know about history, should be reasonably in line with the flat year next year.

And I guess if you want to read into that down, I think that's probably a reasonable way to think of it. How confident are we that the back half of the year will improve? I think that will depend largely on what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. construction and whether or not this trend of maybe part sales firming in construction happens and whether or not we start to see orders from mining companies, which we haven't seen much of so far.

And I wish our intel on that, but -- I wish we were able to break down all the reasons and causes for everything that goes on within dealer inventory. There's usually a reasonable band in terms of months of supply. And you kind of have to look at it in a band. It's not a static kind of expectation. It depends a lot on -- is the bias up or is the bias down in future sales because that will color a lot what dealers hold. How were to your point, how we're shipping? Are we meeting shipping commitments? Are they relatively quick? Can they get what they want when they need it? And so that kind of puts downward bias on what they want to hold as well. The flip side of that is if in allocation. They won't order as much as they can get and they want to hold as much as they can keep. So there's not a hard and fast rule. But somewhere in the sort of maybe 3 months on the low end, 3.5, there's probably a reasonable band. And for the most part, we're in that band. And you have to even take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it depends upon kind of what the product mix is of what's being sold. So if it were all small machines that we sell, that we can provide delivery on in 8 weeks, it provides a bit different dealer dynamic benefits big machines that takes 6 months. But I guess the gist of my answer would be, I don't think there's any massive excess of dealer inventory. I think we'd all like to get dealer inventory down. It's just more efficient for us and dealers if we can deliver quickly what they want, what they need. And then in the ultimate world, wouldn't it be great if they didn't have to have any inventory, that we could just ship them everything in 1 day? Unfortunately, that's not the case.

So if you think about our business in construction, the heavy construction and rental are pretty decent-sized businesses for us. If you look at construction in North America, housing seems to be motoring on and has been okay. The problem we find ourselves in, I think, is the larger projects, the infrastructure spending is maybe not quite as robust as housing would be right now. And that's a bigger sweet spot for us. We have this other dynamic going on, and I'll try to describe it like this. We have too much used equipment in the marketplace right now, and used equipment prices are fairly depressed. And so what that causes in rental, particularly with our rental channel through CAT dealers, is it does not provide much of an incentive for dealers to sell off their used equipment and refresh fleets. So we're seeing the rent -- our sales into the rental channel as pretty challenged right now. And I talked about construction equipment in Resource Industries, in particular articulated trucks. We had quite a bit more rental loading earlier in the year than we've seen here in the back half of the year. So I think, hopefully, sentiment will improve. We'll get the election out of the way. We'll have a new government that's interested in infrastructure spending. And somewhere 6 months to a year down the road, maybe that will turn into something better.

And I'm sure that will hit RI, and we have usually little higher seasonal cost. And I'm sure that will hit RI. So I will not be looking for RI to do better on profit in the fourth quarter."

And I just want to make a few opening comments, and I'll get back to -- we'll get back to Mike in normal conference call stuff. 
I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning process that the board used, just make a few comments on that. We have a -- and we've talked about this before in analyst conferences and so on, but we have a very robust succession planning process that goes all the way down to almost the first levels of management. We review and spend a lot of time on that every year. And every year, at least once, usually in October, we go through that with the board for, let's say, the top 300 -- top 350 people and talk about succession, the future, some names. And then, during the year, we try to introduce the board to a lot of those names and individuals, as we have been doing. 
I certainly have been active in that. I was very adamant that I wanted, when my time was up, and I'll be 64 in February. When I retire at the end of March, I will be 64 years old, with just a few months to go before I'm 65. Pretty much right on the process. There's no drama here, contrary to a lot of the stuff that's going around. But I wanted to -- I was adamant with the board that I wanted a very good, sound process to use, that they were happy with it, our executive office team was happy with it at the end. And both the -- all the executive officers then would go right on through performance and not miss a beat. I think we've achieved that. I picked the timing. I've been very much supportive of Jim. I'm very much supportive of the full executive office. And as we announced a week ago yesterday, I will be CEO until the end of December, and I will be Executive Chairman until the end of March. But we did make a change in governance with a split chair and CEO role. I think most of you know we've had a shareholder proposal on that for several years in a row, and we have a couple of large shareholders that are fundamentally for that. They pushed that at transition times, and obviously, this was a time the board considered that because we were in transition. 
Dave Calhoun will be the Executive Chairman come April 1. I would tell you that I've had a wonderful relationship and extensive and also frequent with the current residing director, Ed Rust, and we talked frequently, before, during and after the -- every single board meeting, and have for years, since I've been on the job. David's role will not be anything different than Jim. Jim will run the company, and David will coordinate the board as Executive Chair. Just a change in governance. Both work very well. I've had great luck with the presiding director situation, and I'm sure Jim and Dave will have great luck with the split chair, CEO role as well. Again, no drama. Just a different way of doing things, and I think we'll carry on and not even miss a beat. 
So with that little preamble, I will tell you I'm excited to move into the next phase. I'm very excited for Jim and the executive team that we have here. I feel the company's positioned. We've been through an awful rough period the last 4 years, as all of you have known and endured, but I do think we're set up for the future. So Mike, if you'd take over."

So if you go to Page 2 on this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements, and I am quite certain that, this morning, we're going to be discussing quite a bit of forward-looking information, and that always involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in aggregate, could make results differ can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is Risk Factors, from our Form 10-K filed with the SEC earlier this year and in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. 
Now in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that are used in both our financial release and this presentation can be found in both the financial release and the last page of the slide deck. 
One more thing, actually, before we get started on the slide deck. And I know that with Doug's announced retirement and with Jim replacing him, I suspect you have a lot of questions for Jim about his long-term strategy. But I would say, since Jim found out he's going to be CEO just about 10 days ago, now is probably not the best time for those kind of questions. So what we're going to ask is, today, we're going to try and keep the call here to our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and kind of our preliminary view of sales for next year. 
So with that, let's start on the slide deck, and if you could flip to Page 4. And on Page 4, that's a high-level summary of what happened in the third quarter to sales and profit -- sales and revenues and profit. So we were down $1.8 billion in the quarter, kind of continued on the same trajectory we've been most of the year. Profit per share dropped from $0.94 per share last year in the third quarter to $0.48 this quarter. Quite a bit of that was from more restructuring costs. Certainly, in the quarter, we had asset impairments -- additional asset impairments related to our Resource Industries business, and restructuring costs were $226 million higher than a year ago. If you exclude the restructuring costs, profit per share was down $0.20, which, I think, is pretty good performance on a $1.8 billion drop in sales. And that'll be a theme, I think, across the next few slides that we'll talk about. Cost reduction was very good. 
So if we go to the next page, it'll kind of walk us through the change in sales in a little bit more detail. So the most significant decline was in Energy & Transportation. We were down a little over $800 million. And transportation -- and in fact, this is, I think, the first time all year we've said that oil and gas was not the most significant reason. But this quarter, it was transportation, followed by power gen, oil and gas and industrial engines. 
Resource Industries was down $465 million. That's about -- that's a little over 25%, and it's been kind of down about in that range every quarter this year. So not a big change. And it's actually a split between mining products and large construction. We don't talk much about construction in Resource Industries, but we have large products like articulated trucks, some of the smaller off-highway trucks, some of the large bulldozers, some of the large wheel loaders are used in construction. And a pretty good decline this quarter in Resource Industries was from construction equipment, and we're seeing that -- quite a bit of that in North America. 
For the Construction Industries segment, we were down $521 million. And again, about 2/3 of that was volume, North America was the most significant region; and about 1/3 of that was price. So the total decline then is $1.8 billion. 
So let's maybe flip to the next slide, Page 6, talk a little bit about profit. And this is our normal waterfall chart. So on the left, the black bar is the third quarter operating profit from a year ago. And then we're isolating what caused changes. So you can see, without a doubt, that $1.8 billion decline in sales and revenues drove substantial impact on profit from lower volume. 
Price realization has remained pretty decent-sized negative, about the same as versus a year ago as last quarter. It was $213 million this quarter. The next 2 bars are the positives. Variable manufacturing costs, that's cost absorption, that's material cost, that's variable labor and overhead in our factories. And that's been positive for all year. Period costs, we've done a lot of work to take structural costs out of the company, and we've actually performed very well on this all year long. 
And then a couple of bars to the right is the restructuring cost. If you look at the decline in operating profit, about half of the decline was from the restructuring cost. So excluding restructuring costs, on the prior page, you saw we were down $0.20. It's a little over $200 million in operating profit. And if you look at that price realization bucket, had we not been in such a difficult pricing environment this quarter, we would have had enough variable and period cost reduction to essentially offset the impact of $1.8 billion in lower sales. 
Now I'm going to ask you to do something I normally wouldn't do at this time. Let's just back up, given that good cost performance. Let's back up to the previous page one more time. So when we look at Energy & Transportation, our sales were down $818 million, but the profit on that level of sales decline was only off $111 million. I think that indicates great cost performance. 
Construction Industries, $521 million decline in sales and revenues in -- and $165 million of that was price realization. Despite that, their profit was only down $28 million. 
Resource Industries, mining and large construction down $465 million in sales, but their profit was down only $35 million. So I think that -- when you look at the change in profit in the context with the change in sales, it just reinforces the point that I made a minute ago, that cost reduction has been very good so far this year. 
So if we move on to Page 7 and look at where we've been on cost reduction this year. You can see, through the first 9 months of the year, we're favorable about $1.8 billion. And that breaks down into 3 major categories. The first is restructuring efforts. We've been on that path for a few years. We announced a fairly big series of restructuring actions last September. And with all those actions, we've reduced square footage, capacity and people. Material cost has been favorable this year. And I know it's tempting to always think about that as just commodity-based, but the fact of the matter is, we've gotten more cost reduction from design- and sourcing-related changes than we have from commodity prices. And then there's everything else, and that includes short-term incentive pay. A little over $300 million of the $1.8 billion is from lower incentive pay this year, at least for our expectations. And -- so even without that, we're $1.5 billion of lower costs this year. 
So that's a little bit about the third quarter. Again, tough sales environment, very good progress on cost reduction across the board. 
So let's look at the outlook. We did lower the 2016 outlook. Previously, we were thinking $40 billion to $40.5 billion for the year and $2.75 profit per share, $3.55 without restructuring costs. Now we've lowered that. We think sales and revenues are going to be about $39 billion this year and profit will be $2.35 a share or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs. 
Now sales came down. So at the midpoint of the outlook, that's about $1.25 billion decline in sales, and that came out across -- relatively evenly across Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Now the decline for construction is particularly in North America, and the weakness in North American construction is impacted, both our Construction Industries segment and, to some degree, Resource Industries for large equipment. So I think -- that's one of the bigger reasons for the decline in the outlook. 
In Energy & Transportation, we also took down rail. We had some business that we thought was going to ship in the second half, and it's been pushed out to later years. And we've also had some decline in oil and gas, and that's mostly from service and overhaul work related to Solar. You always have a lot of questions about Solar. We were thinking Solar was going to be down about 10% this year. It looks like, based on where we're at now, it'll be closer to 15%, and most of that change is related to service and overhaul work, not new turbine sales. 
Power generation has also been down. It's been particularly weak in oil-producing regions. From a profit standpoint, our restructuring costs are about $100 million higher than we expect for the year, and most of that was from the additional asset write-offs that we had in Resource Industries in the third quarter. 
So we don't normally give quarterly guidance, but when we get to this point in the year, we have 3 quarters of actual, and we have a full year forecast. So it's pretty easy to figure out what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. And based on this outlook, it implies about $10 billion of sales and revenues, $0.47 a share profit and $0.67 excluding restructuring. 
If we move to the next page, Page 9, I'll kind of walk you through why, on higher sales, we think profit in the fourth quarter is going to be a bit lower. 
So if you look at the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter outlook, we have sales and revenues up about $800 million. Most all of that is in Energy & Transportation. We always have some seasonality in our fourth quarter sales, so this is probably not a surprise to you. We also have more locomotive shipments in the fourth quarter, particularly Tier 4 locomotives, and we have some large turnkey power generation projects in the fourth quarter. Profit on that higher sales, excluding the restructuring costs, we think, will be about $0.18 lower. And of course, one positive is higher volume. We do have a substantial offset of the higher volume on sales mix. And this is also not, I don't think, very unusual. Over the last couple of years, that's been the case for us. And we've had lower margins in the fourth quarter, and they've tended to rebound then in the first quarter. And we think that's likely the case here as well. 
Cost absorption, one of the things that also happens commonly with us is we -- and it's partly related to the higher sales, we have, usually, a pretty good-sized inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. We're expecting that again this year. And that, we think, will result in negative cost absorption. 
We had -- in the third quarter, because we lowered the outlook, we had a favorable kind of year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter for incentive compensation. We certainly don't expect that to repeat in the fourth quarter. So relative -- third to fourth is going to be negative for that. 
And then another item that we talk about quite a bit in the fourth quarter is a bit of seasonally higher costs at year-end, and we don't have any reason to believe this year will be any different than prior years. So we'd probably -- we expect a little bit of a cost increase in the fourth quarter. 
So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter. Now let's talk about 2017, and that's Page 10. Now we usually provide a preliminary view of next year in our third quarter release, and so we're doing that again this year. It's always difficult at this time of the year to predict that. It's -- the quarter doesn't even start for -- the year doesn't even start for a couple more months. But at this point in time, on balance, we're not expecting 2017 to be significantly different than '16. It doesn't mean that it couldn't be different. That just means, at this point in time, it's a little hard to predict. We have -- we try to give you some insight into our thinking here by providing a list of the positives and a list of the things that we're concerned about. And on the very first bullet, you'll see they're kind of the same thing, and that's commodity prices. So on the plus side, commodity prices have improved from earlier this year, and with -- like oil, for example, it seemed to stabilize somewhere around $50. And certainly, compared with where we were, that's good. That's a positive signal. On the concern side of that, we don't think commodity prices are still quite good enough to drive substantial sales increases next year. We would like to see commodity prices rise more next year. If that happens, that, we think, logically, would be upside for the second half of next year. If that doesn't happen, probably not upside, then. 
On the positive side, construction in China, that's been generally positive this year. Both our market position -- we're doing a bit better than most of our competitors. And the market there has improved, and that's been good for us. If you look at today's release, for example, the one up sales increase that we have on the -- in our release is in construction in Asia. If memory serves me, we were up about 9% there. And we think, as long as there's continued support for growth in China, that next year can be up as well. 
Construction sales in some other developing countries, particularly in places like Brazil, where it's just been a very, very challenging situation. CIS is in that category, too. Been a very, very challenging year for both, Brazil because of deep recession; Russia, and actually, much of the Middle East as well, because of low commodity prices. We kind of think that sales in many of those countries may have bottomed, and there's every opportunity to think that, in places like that, we could have some upside next year. 
Then around mining, and this is a bit related to the commodity comments earlier. It looks to us like the CapEx forecasts are flattening out, and sentiment amongst customers and dealers has been a little bit better, and that's good. On the concern side, in addition to commodity prices, North American construction over the last -- in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter is weaker than we would have thought a few months ago. And if that continues, that would be concerning next year as well. Hopefully, with all the election noise behind us, and particularly if we get some investment in U.S. infrastructure, that could help. But right now, I would think, on balance, it looks pretty tough. 
Economic growth in Europe, it's been kind of okay, but we're still concerned about Brexit. And as that draws nearer, the concerns that we have are, does it impact economic growth and business confidence and investment? 
I think another fallout from the lower oil prices has been power gen, particularly in the oil-producing regions. That's -- it's very weak now, and we don't see anything in the short term that's going to change that around. 
And also kind of related to commodities in a way, marine, particularly for offshore service vessels, we're concerned about. And rail remains a very weak industry, particularly in North America. And industrial engine sales to ag customers, that's loose [ph] engine sales that we sell to ag customers, and particularly ag and some power gen packagers remain pretty weak. 
I know, with Solar, it's always a topic of discussion. So I thought I would kind of give you the -- our current view of Solar as well. So right now, we've had a pretty stable backlog. Based on where it's at right now, it would give us expectations that Solar would be about flat next year with this year. I know you're concerned about how this will play out by segment, and I would tell you that it's not a lot. I mean, when we say not significantly different than '17, by and large, that's probably pretty similar across most of the segments. I would say probably slightly more negative with Energy & Transportation than, say, Resource Industries, which is at such a low bottom. I mean, new equipment sales in -- for the big mining product is down 80% to 90% since 2012. Not as much room there for downside. 
So with that, we'll just wrap up with a few discussion points on Page 11. Not much change over the past quarter in the industries we serve, with the exception of North American construction, which has disappointed. We've had great operational performance, and that's not just cost reduction. Our market position vis-à-vis our competitors was better this quarter than a year ago for our machines and continues to improve in China. Our decrementals in every single segment were very good year-over-year, cost reduction -- and that's driven by cost reduction, which is quite substantial. We're pretty well on track with restructuring. Most of the things that -- of any magnitude that we were considering a year ago in September with that announcement have been made public. Balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to -- our ME&T debt-to-cap is 37% at the end of the quarter. And we had a cash balance of over $6 billion, and we're still thinking that this year will be positive free cash flow. 
So with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for questions."

But we said this in the release, I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year, and we're -- the flattish for the year relies on a bit of improvement in the second half of the year. So I think, to your point on costs, I would suspect, as we wrap this up, we will be planning and trying to set a cost structure for something that's probably a little bit more conservative than where we're thinking sales for the year could be. So it'll remain a very big focus on cost and cost reduction. Won't get into too many of the details yet. As you know, we're kind of in the middle of our planning process for next year right now. But I think some big things that you can certainly expect, one, we'll have a big headwind. I don't know how much yet, but we'll likely have a pretty sizable headwind on incentive compensation. This year, we're pretty -- we're off of our outlook in most areas, off of our plan. So we'll have less-than-expected short-term incentive comps this year for all of our employees and something more normal going into next year could be a headwind of $500 million, $600 million, depending upon where the executive team and the board sets the target. So that would be a headwind. On the positive side, we've done very well on costs. We've taken out more cost as we've gone along this year. So we'll have some benefits from a carryover impact of that. So that should be a tailwind. We've done very well on material costs. And again, much of the commodity benefit and material costs, with the rise in commodity prices, has come out. But even without commodity changes, we've done very well on sourcing and design with material cost. So I think we would see that as a tailwind for next year. So we're still working on all the other items in the plan. And when we get to January, we'll definitely do a more complete review of sales and the profit drivers."

Have you changed your assumptions in terms of where dealer inventory should be at the end of the year and CAT's inventories relative your previous guide?

So I guess that's my first question. And then, also, you mentioned a couple times about your 2017 revenue assumption, the first half is weaker versus the second half. Back to the where -- how we'll be producing relative to in line with retail demand. It's the second half improvement.

I -- it -- predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter -- and this will be a plus or minus probably a couple hundred million dollars, but probably something around -- dealer inventory, in its totality, around $1.5 billion decline this year, with probably somewhere close to half of that coming out in the fourth quarter of this year. So we are not currently producing to end-market demand. This year, let's say, order of magnitude, $1.5 billion lower. Now when you start talking about next year, I'll tell you what makes it really difficult to predict. It depends a lot -- how we'll end the year will depend a lot on how the second half of the year turns out and what expectations for 2018 are. So for example, if things start improving in the middle of next year and there's confidence that 2018 is going to be a better year, part of dealer inventory is thinking about what's going to be needed for the future, not what was needed in the past. So that would tend to help dealer inventory. If 2018 looks bad, if there's some sort of a world event and dealers are more pessimistic, there would likely be some additional dealer inventory reduction. I think it -- I think we'll probably be in a better position to talk about that maybe more in January, but I would say, in our current estimates, we do continue to have some level of dealer inventory reduction in for next year. I guess, at this point, let's just call it a placeholder, but probably not as much as this year."

We would certainly expect a pickup in orders in the first quarter as they want to build some inventory for the second quarter selling season. In the case of Solar, backlog is reasonable. And based on everything we know about history, should be reasonably in line with the flat year next year. So how confident are we in next year's sort of preliminary view? I think we're confident that the first half will definitely be challenged. And I guess, if you want to read into that down, I think that's probably a reasonable way to think of it. How confident are we that the back half of the year will improve? I think that will depend largely on what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. construction, and whether or not this trend of maybe parts sales firming in construction happens and whether or not we start to see orders from mining companies, which we haven't seen much of so far. We're encouraged by the commodity prices, the sentiment, the discussion on CapEx, but to the -- probably to the point that you're making, that has not turned into orders of any magnitude yet.

And I wish our intel on that was -- we were -- I wish we were able to break down all the reasons and causes for everything that goes on within dealer inventory. There's usually a reasonable band in terms of months of supply, and you kind of have to look at it in a band. It's not a static kind of -- it depends a lot on, is the bias up or is the bias down on future sales, because that will color a lot what dealers hold. How we're -- to your point, how we're shipping, are we meeting shipping commitments? Are they relatively quick? Can they get what they want when they need it? And sort of that kind of puts a downward bias on what they want to hold as well. The flip side of that is if we're on allocation. They want to order as much as they can get, and they want to hold as much as they can keep. So there's not a hard and fast rule. But somewhere in the sort of maybe 3 months on the low end, 3.5, there's probably a reasonable band. And for the most part, we're in that band. And you have to even take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it depends upon kind of what the product mix is of what's being sold. So if it were all small machines that we sell that we can provide delivery on in 8 weeks, it provides a little different dealer dynamic than if it's big machines that take 6 months. But I guess, the gist of my answer would be I don't think there's any massive excess of dealer inventory. I think we all would like to get dealer inventory down. It's just more efficient for us and dealers if we can deliver quickly what they want, what they need. In an ultimate world, wouldn't it be great if they didn't have to have any inventory and we could just ship them everything in 1 day? Unfortunately, that's not the case, but you're always striving to do better."

So if you think about our business in construction, the heavy construction and rental are pretty decent-sized businesses for us. If you look at construction in North America, housing seems to be motoring on and has been okay. The problem we find ourselves in, I think, is the larger projects, the infrastructure spending is maybe not quite as robust as housing would be right now, and that's a bigger sweet spot for us. We had -- we have this other dynamic going on, and I'll try to describe it like this. We have too much used equipment in the marketplace right now, and used equipment prices are fairly depressed. And so what that causes in rental, particularly with our rental channel through CAT dealers, is it does not provide much of an incentive for dealers to sell off their used equipment and refresh fleets. So we're seeing the rent -- our sales into the rental channel as pretty challenged right now. And I talked about construction equipment in Resource Industries, in particular, articulated trucks. We had quite a bit more rental loading earlier in the year than we've seen here in the back half of the year. So I think, hopefully, sentiment will improve. We'll get the election out of the way, we'll have a new government that's interested in infrastructure spending. And somewhere 6 months to a year down the road, maybe that will turn into something better. But right now, I think we're on the fence and concerned about overall construction in North America."

And I just want to make a few opening comments, and I'll get back to -- we'll get back to Mike in -- and normal conference call stuff. I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning pro",623,"Yes. Good morning, everybody. It's Doug Oberhelman here. And I just want to make a few opening comments, and I'll get back to -- we'll get back to Mike in -- and normal conference call stuff. 
I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning process that the board used, just make a few comments on that. We have a -- and we've talked about this before in analyst conferences and so on, but we have a very robust succession planning process that goes all the way down to almost the first levels of management. We review and spend a lot of time on that every year. And every year, at least once, usually in October, we go through that with the board for, let's say, the top 300 -- top 350 people and talk about succession, the future, some names. And then, during the year, we try to introduce the board to a lot of those names and individuals, as we have been doing. 
I certainly have been active in that. I was very adamant that I wanted, when my time was up, and I'll be 64 in February. When I retire at the end of March, I will be 64 years old, with just a few months to go before I'm 65. Pretty much right on the process. There's no drama here, contrary to a lot of the stuff that's going around. But I wanted to -- I was adamant with the board that I wanted a very good, sound process to use, that they were happy with it, that our executive office team was happy with it at the end. And both the -- all the executive officers then would go right on through performance and not miss a beat. I think we've achieved that. I picked the timing. I've been very much supportive of Jim. I'm very much supportive of the full executive office. And as we announced a week ago yesterday, I will be CEO until the end of December, and I will be Executive Chairman until the end of March. But we did make a change in governance with a split chair and CEO role. I think most of you know we've had a shareholder proposal on that for several years in a row, and we have a couple of large shareholders that are fundamentally for that. They pushed that at transition times, and obviously, this was a time the board considered that because we were in transition. 
Dave Calhoun will be the Executive Chairman come April 1. I will tell you that I've had a wonderful relationship and extensive and also frequent with the current residing director, Ed Rust, and we talked frequently, before, during and after the -- every single board meeting, and have for years, since I've been on the job. David's role will not be anything different than Jim. Jim will run the company, and David will coordinate the board as Executive Chair. Just a change in governance. Both work very well. I've had great luck with the presiding director situation, and I'm sure Jim and Dave will have great luck with the split chair, CEO role as well. Again, no drama. Just a different way of doing things, and I think we'll carry on and not even miss a beat. 
So with that little preamble, I will tell you I'm excited to move into the next phase. I'm very excited for Jim and the executive team that we have here. I feel the company's positioned. We've been through an awful rough period the last 4 years, as all of you have known and endured, but I do think we're set up for the future. So Mike, if you'd take over."

If you don't have that slide deck in front of you, you can pick it up on our caterpillar.com website with -- where the conference call webcast link was.

So if you go to Page 2 on this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements, and I am quite certain that, this morning, we're going to be discussing quite a bit of forward-looking information, and that always involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in aggregate, could make results differ can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is Risk Factors, from our Form 10-K filed with the SEC earlier this year and in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. 
Now in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that are used in both our financial release and this presentation can be found in both the financial release and the last page of the slide deck. 
One more thing, actually, before we get started on the slide deck. And I know that with Doug's announced retirement and with Jim replacing him, I suspect you have a lot of questions for Jim about his long-term strategy. But I would say, since Jim found out he's going to be CEO just about 10 days ago, now is probably not the best time for those kind of questions. So what we're going to ask is, today, we're going to try and keep the call here to our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and kind of our preliminary view of sales for next year. 
So with that, let's start on the slide deck, and if you could flip to Page 4. And on Page 4, that's a high-level summary of what happened in the third quarter to sales and profit -- sales and revenues and profit. So we were down $1.8 billion in the quarter, kind of continued on the same trajectory we've been most of the year. Profit per share dropped from $0.94 per share last year in the third quarter to $0.48 this quarter. Quite a bit of that was from more restructuring costs. Certainly, in the quarter, we had asset impairments -- additional asset impairments related to our Resource Industries business, and restructuring costs were $226 million higher than a year ago. If you exclude the restructuring costs, profit per share was down $0.20, which, I think, is pretty good performance on a $1.8 billion drop in sales. And that'll be a theme, I think, across the next few slides that we'll talk about. Cost reduction was very good. 
So if we go to the next page, it'll kind of walk us through the change in sales in a little bit more detail. So the most significant decline was in Energy & Transportation. We were down a little over $800 million. And transportation -- and in fact, this is, I think, the first time all year we've said that oil and gas was not the most significant reason. But this quarter, it was transportation, followed by power gen, oil and gas and industrial engines. 
Resource Industries was down $465 million. That's about -- that's a little over 25%, and it's been kind of down about in that range every quarter this year. So not a big change. And it's actually a split between mining products and large construction. We don't talk much about construction in Resource Industries, but we have large products like articulated trucks, some of the smaller off-highway trucks, some of the large bulldozers, some of the large wheel loaders are used in construction. And a pretty good decline this quarter in Resource Industries was from construction equipment, and we're seeing that -- quite a bit of that in North America. 
For the Construction Industries segment, we were down $521 million. And again, about 2/3 of that was volume, North America was the most significant region; and about 1/3 of that was price. So the total decline then is $1.8 billion. 
So let's maybe flip to the next slide, Page 6, talk a little bit about profit. And this is our normal waterfall chart. So on the left, the black bar is the third quarter operating profit from a year ago. And then we're isolating what caused changes. So you can see, without a doubt, that $1.8 billion decline in sales and revenues drove substantial impact on profit from lower volume. 
Price realization has remained pretty decent-sized negative, about the same as versus a year ago as last quarter. It was $213 million this quarter. The next 2 bars are the positives. Variable manufacturing costs, that's cost absorption, that's material cost, that's variable labor and overhead in our factories. And that's been positive for all year. Period costs, we've done a lot of work to take structural costs out of the company, and we've actually performed very well on this all year long. 
And then a couple of bars to the right is the restructuring cost. If you look at the decline in operating profit, about half of the decline was from the restructuring cost. So excluding restructuring costs, on the prior page, you saw we were down $0.20. It's a little over $200 million in operating profit. And if you look at that price realization bucket, had we not been in such a difficult pricing environment this quarter, we would have had enough variable and period cost reduction to essentially offset the impact of $1.8 billion in lower sales. 
Now I'm going to ask you to do something I wouldn't normally do at this time. Let's just back up, given that good cost performance. Let's back up to the previous page one more time. So when we look at Energy & Transportation, their sales were down $818 million, but their profit on that level of sales decline was only off $111 million. I think that indicates great cost performance. 
Construction Industries, $521 million decline in sales and revenues in -- and $165 million of that was price realization. Despite that, their profit was only down $28 million. 
Resource Industries, mining and large construction down $465 million in sales, but their profit was down only $35 million. So I think that -- when you look at the change in profit in the context with the change in sales, it just reinforces the point that I made a minute ago, that cost reduction has been very good so far this year. 
So if we move on to Page 7 and look at where we've been on cost reduction this year. You can see, through the first 9 months of the year, we're favorable about $1.8 billion. And that breaks down into 3 major categories. The first is restructuring efforts. We've been on that path for a few years. We announced a fairly big series of restructuring actions last September. And with all those actions, we've reduced square footage, capacity and people. Material cost has been favorable this year. And I know it's tempting to always think about that as just commodity-based, but the fact of the matter is, we've gotten more cost reduction from design- and sourcing-related changes than we have from commodity prices. And then there's everything else, and that includes short-term incentive pay. A little over $300 million of the $1.8 billion is from lower incentive pay this year, at least for our expectations. And -- so even without that, we're $1.5 billion of lower costs this year. 
So that's a little bit about the third quarter. Again, tough sales environment, very good progress on cost reduction across the board. 
So let's look at the outlook. We did lower the 2016 outlook. Previously, we were thinking $40 billion to $40.5 billion for the year and $2.75 profit per share, $3.55 without restructuring costs. Now we've lowered that. We think sales and revenues are going to be about $39 billion this year and profit will be $2.35 a share or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs. 
Now sales came down. So at the midpoint of the outlook, that's about $1.25 billion decline in sales, and that came out across -- relatively evenly across Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Now the decline for construction is particularly in North America, and the weakness in North American construction is impacted, both our Construction Industries segment and, to some degree, Resource Industries for large equipment. So I think that's one of the bigger reasons for the decline in the outlook. 
In Energy & Transportation, we also took down rail. We had some business that we thought was going to ship in the second half, and it's been pushed out to later years. And we've also had some decline in oil and gas, and that's mostly from service and overhaul work related to Solar. You always have a lot of questions about Solar. We were thinking Solar was going to be down about 10% this year. It looks like, based on where we're at now, it'll be closer to 15%, and most of that change is related to service and overhaul work, not new turbine sales. 
Power generation has also been down. It's been particularly weak in oil-producing regions. From a profit standpoint, our restructuring costs are about $100 million higher that we expect for the year, and most of that was from the additional asset write-offs that we had in Resource Industries in the third quarter. 
So we don't normally give quarterly guidance, but when we get to this point in the year, we have 3 quarters of actual, and we have a full year forecast. So it's pretty easy to figure out what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. And based on this outlook, it implies about $10 billion of sales and revenues, $0.47 a share profit and $0.67 excluding restructuring. 
If we move to the next page, Page 9, I'll kind of walk you through why, on higher sales, we think profit in the fourth quarter is going to be a bit lower. 
So if you look at the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter outlook, we have sales and revenues up about $800 million. Most all of that is in Energy & Transportation. We always have some seasonality in our fourth quarter sales, so this is probably not a surprise to you. We also have more locomotive shipments in the fourth quarter, particularly Tier 4 locomotives, and we have some large turnkey power generation projects in the fourth quarter. Profit on that higher sales, excluding the restructuring costs, we think, will be about $0.18 lower. And of course, one positive is higher volume. We do have a substantial offset of the higher volume on sales mix. And this is also not, I don't think, very unusual. Over the last couple of years, that's been the case for us. And we've had lower margins in the fourth quarter, and they've tended to rebound then in the first quarter. And we think that's likely the case here as well. 
Cost absorption. One of the things that also happens commonly with us is we -- and it's partly related to the higher sales, we have, usually, a pretty good-sized inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. We're expecting that again this year. And that, we think, will result in negative cost absorption. 
We had -- in the third quarter, because we lowered the outlook, we had a favorable kind of year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter for incentive compensation. We certainly don't expect that to repeat in the fourth quarter. So relative -- third to fourth is going to be negative for that. 
And then another item that we talk about quite a bit in the fourth quarter is a bit of seasonally higher costs at year-end, and we don't have any reason to believe this year will be any different than prior years. So we'd probably -- we expect a little bit of a cost increase in the fourth quarter. 
So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter. Now let's talk about 2017, and that's Page 10. Now we usually provide a preliminary view of next year in our third quarter release, and so we're doing that again this year. It's always difficult at this time of the year to predict that. It's -- the quarter doesn't even start for -- the year doesn't even start for a couple more months. But at this point in time, on balance, we're not expecting 2017 to be significantly different than '16. It doesn't mean that it couldn't be different. That just means, at this point in time, it's a little hard to predict. We have -- we try to give you some insight into our thinking here by providing a list of the positives and a list of the things that we're concerned about. And on the very first bullet, you'll see they're kind of the same thing, and that's commodity prices. So on the plus side, commodity prices have improved from earlier this year, and with -- like oil, for example, it seemed to stabilize somewhere around $50. And certainly, compared with where we were, that's good. That's a positive signal. On the concern side of that, we don't think commodity prices are still quite good enough to drive substantial sales increases next year. We would like to see commodity prices rise more next year. If that happens, that, we think, logically, would be upside for the second half of next year. If that doesn't happen, probably not upside, then. 
On the positive side, construction in China, that's been generally positive this year. Both our market position -- we're doing a bit better than most of our competitors. And the market there has improved, and that's been good for us. If you look at today's release, for example, the one up sales increase that we have on the -- in our release is in construction in Asia. If memory serves me, we were up about 9% there. And we think, as long as there's continued support for growth in China, that next year can be up as well. 
Construction sales in some other developing countries, particularly in places like Brazil, where it's just been a very, very challenging situation. CIS is in that category, too. Been a very, very challenging year for both, Brazil because of deep recession; Russia, and actually, much of the Middle East as well, because of low commodity prices. We kind of think that sales in many of those countries may have bottomed, and there's every opportunity to think that, in places like that, we could have some upside next year. 
Then around mining, and this is a bit related to the commodity comments earlier. It looks to us like the CapEx forecasts are flattening out, and sentiment amongst customers and dealers has been a little bit better, and that's good. On the concern side, in addition to commodity prices, North American construction over the last -- in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter is weaker than we would have thought a few months ago. And if that continues, that would be concerning next year as well. Hopefully, with all the election noise behind us, and particularly if we get some investment in U.S. infrastructure, that could help. But right now, I would think, on balance, it looks pretty tough. 
Economic growth in Europe, it's been kind of okay, but we're still concerned about Brexit. And as that draws nearer, the concerns that we have are, does it impact economic growth and business confidence and investment? 
I think another fallout from the lower oil prices has been power gen, particularly in the oil-producing regions. That's -- it's very weak now, and we don't see anything in the short term that's going to change that around. 
And also kind of related to commodities in a way, marine, particularly for offshore service vessels, we're concerned about. And rail remains a very weak industry, particularly in North America. And industrial engine sales to ag customers, that's loose engine sales that we sell to ag customers, and particularly ag and some power gen packagers remain pretty weak. 
I know, with Solar, it's always a topic of discussion. So I thought I would kind of give you the -- our current view of Solar as well. So right now, we've had a pretty stable backlog. Based on where it's at right now, it would give us expectations that Solar would be about flat next year with this year. I know you're concerned about how this will play out by segment, and I would tell you that it's not a lot. I mean, when we say not significantly different than '17, by and large, that's probably pretty similar across most of the segments. I would say probably slightly more negative with Energy & Transportation than, say, Resource Industries, which is at such a low bottom. I mean, new equipment sales in -- for the big mining product is down 80% to 90% since 2012. Not as much room there for downside. 
So with that, we'll just wrap up with a few discussion points on Page 11. Not much change over the past quarter in the industries we serve, with the exception of North American construction, which has disappointed. We've had great operational performance, and that's not just cost reduction. Our market position vis-à-vis our competitors was better this quarter than a year ago for our machines and continues to improve in China. Our decrementals in every single segment were very good year-over-year, cost reduction -- and that's driven by cost reduction, which is quite substantial. We're pretty well on track with restructuring. Most of the things that -- of any magnitude that we were considering a year ago in September with that announcement have been made public. Balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to -- our ME&T debt-to-cap is 37% at the end of the quarter. And we had a cash balance of over $6 billion, and we're still thinking that this year will be a positive free cash flow. 
So with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for questions."

So as we said on sales, I'll start with that, on balance, we're not seeing a significant difference. But we said this in the release, I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year, and we're -- the flattish for the year relies on",370,"Yes.

But we said this in the release, I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year, and we're -- the flattish for the year relies on a bit of improvement in the second half of the year. So I think, to your point on costs, I would suspect, as we wrap this up, we will be planning and trying to set a cost structure for something that's probably a little bit more conservative than where we're thinking sales for the year could be. So there will remain a very big focus on cost and cost reduction. Won't get into too many of the details yet. As you know, we're kind of in the middle of our planning process for next year right now. But I think some big things that you can certainly expect, one, we'll have a big headwind. I don't know how much yet, but we'll likely have a pretty sizable headwind on incentive compensation. This year, we're pretty -- we're off of our outlook in most areas, off of our plan. So we'll have less-than-expected short-term incentive comps this year for all of our employees and something more normal going into next year could be a headwind of $500 million, $600 million, depending upon where the executive team and the board sets the target. So that would be a headwind. On the positive side, we've done very well on costs. We've taken out more cost as we've gone along this year. So we'll have some benefits from a carryover impact of that. So that should be a tailwind. We've done very well on material costs. And again, much of the commodity benefit and material costs, with the rise in commodity prices, has come out. But even without commodity changes, we've done very well on sourcing and design with material cost. So I think we would see that as a tailwind for next year. So we're still working on all the other items in the plan. And when we get to January, we'll definitely do a more complete review of sales and the profit drivers."

I guess, Mike, my first question -- I appreciate the color on the fourth quarter revenues as well as the EPS and why the EPS is lighter, but can you just give me a little more color? Have you changed your assumptions in terms of where dealer inventory should be at the end of the year and CAT's inventories relative to your previous guide? Because I think what everyone is trying to get a better understanding of is as we approach 2017, what's your confidence level that we should start to produce in line with retail demand, given where we are today? So I guess that's my first question. And then, also, you mentioned a couple times about your 2017 revenue assumption, the first half is weaker versus the second half. Back to the where -- how we'll be producing relative to in line with retail demand. It's a second half improvement. You're assuming the markets get better, or is there some change in what would be normal seasonality in terms of production for Caterpillar?"

I -- it -- predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter -- and this will be a plus or minus probably a couple hundred million dollars, but probably something around -- dealer inventory, in its totality, around $1.5 billion decline this year, with probably somewhere close to half of that coming out in the fourth quarter of this year. So we are not currently producing to end-market demand. This year, let's say, order of magnitude, $1.5 billion lower. Now when you start talking about next year, I'll tell you what makes it really difficult to predict. It depends a lot -- how we'll end the year will depend a lot on how the second half of the year turns out and what expectations for 2018 are. So for example, if things start improving in the middle of next year and there's confidence that 2018 is going to be a better year, part of dealer inventory is thinking about what's going to be needed for the future, not what was needed in the past. So that would tend to help dealer inventory. If 2018 looks bad, if there's some sort of a world event and dealers are more pessimistic, there would likely be some additional dealer inventory reduction. I think it -- I think we'll probably be in a better position to talk about that maybe more in January, but I would say, in our current estimates, we do continue to have some level of dealer inventory reduction in for next year. I guess, at this point, let's just call it a placeholder, but probably not as much as this year."

We -- in our K last year, we provided more color on goodwill. And the segment that has more of the -- or that had -- the closest a year ago to triggering an impairment, I think, if memory serves me, it was about 15% off.

Dealers are -- like I said a minute ago, dealers are planning to cut inventory in the fourth quarter, so I think, naturally, they're ordering less. We would certainly expect a pickup in orders in the first quarter as they want to build some inventory for the second quarter selling season. In the case of Solar, backlog is reasonable. And based on everything we know about history, should be reasonably in line with the flat year next year. So how confident are we in next year's sort of preliminary view? I think we're confident that the first half will definitely be challenged. And I guess, if you want to read into that down, I think that's probably a reasonable way to think of it. How confident are we that the back half of the year will improve? I think that will depend largely on what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. construction, and whether or not this trend of maybe parts sales firming in construction happens and whether or not we start to see orders from mining companies, which we haven't seen much of so far. We're encouraged by the commodity prices, the sentiment, the discussion on CapEx, but to the -- probably to the point that you're making, that has not turned into orders of any magnitude yet.

And when asked for kinds of puts and takes for next year, I was silent on price realization. So on the positive side, we did put list prices up for machines in the range of some none, some as much as 4%. We don't provide any kind of a weighting on that. So it's a little tough for you to know kind of what an overall average is for that. And then, even that, that's just machines. So that wouldn't have aftermarket in it, and that's not Energy & Transportation either. So I think -- but I think the fact that we had a 0 to plus-4% range, you can look at and think of that as a bias for a little better price. The flip side of that is, price realization this year, we did not take list prices down but we have negative price realizations. So the market will be what the market will be, regardless of what we put out in list price changes. I think, at this point, I didn't talk about it as a headwind or a tailwind, and I think that probably describes, at this point anyway, how we're thinking about it."

And I wish our intel on that was -- we were -- I wish we were able to break down all the reasons and causes for everything that goes on within dealer inventory. There's usually a reasonable band in terms of months of supply, and you kind of have to look at it in a band. It's not a static kind of -- it depends a lot on, is the bias up or is the bias down on future sales, because that will color a lot what dealers hold. How we're -- to your point, how we're shipping, are we meeting shipping commitments? Are they relatively quick? Can they get what they want when they need it? And sort of that kind of puts a downward bias on what they want to hold as well. The flip side of that is, if we're on allocation, they want to order as much as they can get, and they want to hold as much as they can keep. So there's not a hard and fast rule. But somewhere in the sort of maybe 3 months on the low end, 3.5, is probably a reasonable band. And for the most part, we're in that band. And you have to even take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it depends upon kind of what the product mix is of what's being sold. So if it were all small machines that we sell that we can provide delivery on in 8 weeks, it provides a little different dealer dynamic than if it's big machines that take 6 months. But I guess, the gist of my answer would be I don't think there's any massive excess of dealer inventory. I think we all would like to get dealer inventory down. It's just more efficient for us and dealers if we can deliver quickly what they want, what they need. In an ultimate world, wouldn't it be great if they didn't have to have any inventory and we could just ship them everything in 1 day? Unfortunately, that's not the case, but you're always striving to do better."

So if you think about our business in construction, the heavy construction and rental are pretty decent-sized businesses for us. If you look at construction in North America, housing seems to be motoring on and has been okay. The problem we find ourselves in, I think, is the larger projects, the infrastructure spending is maybe not quite as robust as housing would be right now, and that's a bigger sweet spot for us. We had -- we have this other dynamic going on, and I'll try to describe it like this. We have too much used equipment in the marketplace right now, and used equipment prices are fairly depressed. And so what that causes in rental, particularly with our rental channel through CAT dealers, is it does not provide much of an incentive for dealers to sell off their used equipment and refresh fleets. So we're seeing the rent -- our sales into the rental channel as pretty challenged right now. And I talked about construction equipment in Resource Industries, in particular, articulated trucks. We had quite a bit more rental loading earlier in the year than we've seen here in the back half of the year. So I think, hopefully, sentiment will improve. We'll get the election out of the way, we'll have a new government that's interested in infrastructure spending. And somewhere 6 months to a year down the road, maybe that will turn into something better. But right now, I think we're on the fence and concerned about overall construction in North America."

And I just want to make a few opening comments, and I'll get back to -- we'll get back to Mike in -- and normal conference call stuff. 
I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning process that the board used, just make a few comments on that. We have a -- and we've talked about this before in analyst conferences and so on, but we have a very robust succession planning process that goes all the way down to almost the first levels of management. We review and spend a lot of time on that every year. And every year, at least once, usually in October, we go through that with the board for, let's say, the top 300 -- top 350 people and talk about succession, the future, some names. And then, during the year, we try to introduce the board to a lot of those names and individuals, as we have been doing. 
I certainly have been active in that. I was very adamant that I wanted, when my time was up, and I'll be 64 in February. When I retire at the end of March, I will be 64 years old, with just a few months to go before I'm 65. Pretty much right on the process. There's no drama here, contrary to a lot of the stuff that's going around. But I wanted to -- I was adamant with the board that I wanted a very good, sound process to use, that they were happy with it, that our executive office team was happy with it at the end. And both the -- all the executive officers then would go right on through performance and not miss a beat. I think we've achieved that. I picked the timing. I've been very much supportive of Jim. I'm very much supportive of the full executive office. And as we announced a week ago yesterday, I will be CEO until the end of December, and I will be Executive Chairman until the end of March. But we did make a change in governance with a split chair and CEO role. I think most of you know we've had a shareholder proposal on that for several years in a row, and we have a couple of large shareholders that are fundamentally for that. They pushed that at transition times, and obviously, this was a time the board considered that because we were in transition. 
Dave Calhoun will be the Executive Chairman come April 1. I will tell you that I've had a wonderful relationship and extensive and also frequent with the current residing director, Ed Rust, and we talked frequently, before, during and after the -- every single board meeting, and have for years, since I've been on the job. David's role will not be anything different than Jim. Jim will run the company, and David will coordinate the board as Executive Chair. Just a change in governance. Both work very well. I've had great luck with the presiding director situation, and I'm sure Jim and Dave will have great luck with the split chair, CEO role as well. Again, no drama. Just a different way of doing things, and I think we'll carry on and not even miss a beat. 
So with that little preamble, I will tell you I'm excited to move into the next phase. I'm very excited for Jim and the executive team that we have here. I feel the company's positioned. We've been through an awful rough period the last 4 years, as all of you have known and endured, but I do think we're set up for the future. So Mike, if you'd take over."

If you don't have that slide deck in front of you, you can pick it up on our caterpillar.com website with -- where the conference call webcast link was. 
Just as a reminder, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of that same caterpillar.com website, and it'll be in a section labeled Results Webcast. 
So if you go to Page 2 on this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements, and I am quite certain that, this morning, we're going to be discussing quite a bit of forward-looking information, and that always involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
In addition to Page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that, either individually or in aggregate, could make results differ can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is Risk Factors, from our Form 10-K filed with the SEC earlier this year and in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. 
Now in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that are used in both our financial release and this presentation can be found in both the financial release and the last page of the slide deck. 
One more thing, actually, before we get started on the slide deck. And I know that with Doug's announced retirement and with Jim replacing him, I suspect you have a lot of questions for Jim about his long-term strategy. But I would say, since Jim found out he's going to be CEO just about 10 days ago, now is probably not the best time for those kind of questions. So what we're going to ask is, today, we're going to try and keep the call here to our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and kind of our preliminary view of sales for next year. 
So with that, let's start on the slide deck, and if you could flip to Page 4. And on Page 4, that's a high-level summary of what happened in the third quarter to sales and profit -- sales and revenues and profit. So we were down $1.8 billion in the quarter, kind of continued on the same trajectory we've been most of the year. Profit per share dropped from $0.94 per share last year in the third quarter to $0.48 this quarter. Quite a bit of that was from more restructuring costs. Certainly, in the quarter, we had asset impairments -- additional asset impairments related to our Resource Industries business, and restructuring costs were $226 million higher than a year ago. If you exclude the restructuring costs, profit per share was down $0.20, which, I think, is pretty good performance on a $1.8 billion drop in sales. And that'll be a theme, I think, across the next few slides that we'll talk about. Cost reduction was very good. 
So if we go to the next page, it'll kind of walk us through the change in sales in a little bit more detail. So the most significant decline was in Energy & Transportation. We were down a little over $800 million. And transportation -- and in fact, this is, I think, the first time all year we've said that oil and gas was not the most significant reason. But this quarter, it was transportation, followed by power gen, oil and gas and industrial engines. 
Resource Industries was down $465 million. That's about -- that's a little over 25%, and it's been kind of down about in that range every quarter this year. So not a big change. And it's actually a split between mining products and large construction. We don't talk much about construction in Resource Industries, but we have large products like articulated trucks, some of the smaller off-highway trucks, some of the large bulldozers, some of the large wheel loaders are used in construction. And a pretty good decline this quarter in Resource Industries was from construction equipment, and we're seeing that -- quite a bit of that in North America. 
For the Construction Industries segment, we were down $521 million. And again, about 2/3 of that was volume, North America was the most significant region; and about 1/3 of that was price. So the total decline then is $1.8 billion. 
So let's maybe flip to the next slide, Page 6, talk a little bit about profit. And this is our normal waterfall chart. So on the left, the black bar is the third quarter operating profit from a year ago. And then we're isolating what caused changes. So you can see, without a doubt, that $1.8 billion decline in sales and revenues drove substantial impact on profit from lower volume. 
Price realization has remained pretty decent-sized negative, about the same as versus a year ago as last quarter. It was $213 million this quarter. The next 2 bars are the positives. Variable manufacturing costs, that's cost absorption, that's material cost, that's variable labor and overhead in our factories. And that's been positive for all year. Period costs, we've done a lot of work to take structural costs out of the company, and we've actually performed very well on this all year long. 
And then a couple of bars to the right is the restructuring cost. If you look at the decline in operating profit, about half of the decline was from the restructuring cost. So excluding restructuring costs, on the prior page, you saw we were down $0.20. It's a little over $200 million in operating profit. And if you look at that price realization bucket, had we not been in such a difficult pricing environment this quarter, we would have had enough variable and period cost reduction to essentially offset the impact of $1.8 billion in lower sales. 
Now I'm going to ask you to do something I wouldn't normally do at this time. Let's just back up, given that good cost performance. Let's back up to the previous page one more time. So when we look at Energy & Transportation, their sales were down $818 million, but their profit on that level of sales decline was only off $111 million. I think that indicates great cost performance. 
Construction Industries, $521 million decline in sales and revenues in -- and $165 million of that was price realization. Despite that, their profit was only down $28 million. 
Resource Industries, mining and large construction down $465 million in sales, but their profit was down only $35 million. So I think that -- when you look at the change in profit in the context with the change in sales, it just reinforces the point that I made a minute ago, that cost reduction has been very good so far this year. 
So if we move on to Page 7 and look at where we've been on cost reduction this year. You can see, through the first 9 months of the year, we're favorable about $1.8 billion. And that breaks down into 3 major categories. The first is restructuring efforts. We've been on that path for a few years. We announced a fairly big series of restructuring actions last September. And with all those actions, we've reduced square footage, capacity and people. Material cost has been favorable this year. And I know it's tempting to always think about that as just commodity-based, but the fact of the matter is, we've gotten more cost reduction from design- and sourcing-related changes than we have from commodity prices. And then there's everything else, and that includes short-term incentive pay. A little over $300 million of the $1.8 billion is from lower incentive pay this year, at least for our expectations. And -- so even without that, we're $1.5 billion of lower costs this year. 
So that's a little bit about the third quarter. Again, tough sales environment, very good progress on cost reduction across the board. 
So let's look at the outlook. We did lower the 2016 outlook. Previously, we were thinking $40 billion to $40.5 billion for the year and $2.75 profit per share, $3.55 without restructuring costs. Now we've lowered that. We think sales and revenues are going to be about $39 billion this year and profit will be $2.35 a share or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs. 
Now sales came down. So at the midpoint of the outlook, that's about $1.25 billion decline in sales, and that came out across -- relatively evenly across Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Now the decline for construction is particularly in North America, and the weakness in North American construction is impacted, both our Construction Industries segment and, to some degree, Resource Industries for large equipment. So I think that's one of the bigger reasons for the decline in the outlook. 
In Energy & Transportation, we also took down rail. We had some business that we thought was going to ship in the second half, and it's been pushed out to later years. And we've also had some decline in oil and gas, and that's mostly from service and overhaul work related to Solar. You always have a lot of questions about Solar. We were thinking Solar was going to be down about 10% this year. It looks like, based on where we're at now, it'll be closer to 15%, and most of that change is related to service and overhaul work, not new turbine sales. 
Power generation has also been down. It's been particularly weak in oil-producing regions. From a profit standpoint, our restructuring costs are about $100 million higher that we expect for the year, and most of that was from the additional asset write-offs that we had in Resource Industries in the third quarter. 
So we don't normally give quarterly guidance, but when we get to this point in the year, we have 3 quarters of actual, and we have a full year forecast. So it's pretty easy to figure out what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. And based on this outlook, it implies about $10 billion of sales and revenues, $0.47 a share profit and $0.67 excluding restructuring. 
If we move to the next page, Page 9, I'll kind of walk you through why, on higher sales, we think profit in the fourth quarter is going to be a bit lower. 
So if you look at the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter outlook, we have sales and revenues up about $800 million. Most all of that is in Energy & Transportation. We always have some seasonality in our fourth quarter sales, so this is probably not a surprise to you. We also have more locomotive shipments in the fourth quarter, particularly Tier 4 locomotives, and we have some large turnkey power generation projects in the fourth quarter. Profit on that higher sales, excluding the restructuring costs, we think, will be about $0.18 lower. And of course, one positive is higher volume. We do have a substantial offset of the higher volume on sales mix. And this is also not, I don't think, very unusual. Over the last couple of years, that's been the case for us. And we've had lower margins in the fourth quarter, and they've tended to rebound then in the first quarter. And we think that's likely the case here as well. 
Cost absorption. One of the things that also happens commonly with us is we -- and it's partly related to the higher sales, we have, usually, a pretty good-sized inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. We're expecting that again this year. And that, we think, will result in negative cost absorption. 
We had -- in the third quarter, because we lowered the outlook, we had a favorable kind of year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter for incentive compensation. We certainly don't expect that to repeat in the fourth quarter. So relative -- third to fourth is going to be negative for that. 
And then another item that we talk about quite a bit in the fourth quarter is a bit of seasonally higher costs at year-end, and we don't have any reason to believe this year will be any different than prior years. So we'd probably -- we expect a little bit of a cost increase in the fourth quarter. 
So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter. Now let's talk about 2017, and that's Page 10. Now we usually provide a preliminary view of next year in our third quarter release, and so we're doing that again this year. It's always difficult at this time of the year to predict that. It's -- the quarter doesn't even start for -- the year doesn't even start for a couple more months. But at this point in time, on balance, we're not expecting 2017 to be significantly different than '16. It doesn't mean that it couldn't be different. That just means, at this point in time, it's a little hard to predict. We have -- we try to give you some insight into our thinking here by providing a list of the positives and a list of the things that we're concerned about. And on the very first bullet, you'll see they're kind of the same thing, and that's commodity prices. So on the plus side, commodity prices have improved from earlier this year, and with -- like oil, for example, it seemed to stabilize somewhere around $50. And certainly, compared with where we were, that's good. That's a positive signal. On the concern side of that, we don't think commodity prices are still quite good enough to drive substantial sales increases next year. We would like to see commodity prices rise more next year. If that happens, that, we think, logically, would be upside for the second half of next year. If that doesn't happen, probably not upside, then. 
On the positive side, construction in China, that's been generally positive this year. Both our market position -- we're doing a bit better than most of our competitors. And the market there has improved, and that's been good for us. If you look at today's release, for example, the one up sales increase that we have on the -- in our release is in construction in Asia. If memory serves me, we were up about 9% there. And we think, as long as there's continued support for growth in China, that next year can be up as well. 
Construction sales in some other developing countries, particularly in places like Brazil, where it's just been a very, very challenging situation. CIS is in that category, too. Been a very, very challenging year for both, Brazil because of deep recession; Russia, and actually, much of the Middle East as well, because of low commodity prices. We kind of think that sales in many of those countries may have bottomed, and there's every opportunity to think that, in places like that, we could have some upside next year. 
Then around mining, and this is a bit related to the commodity comments earlier. It looks to us like the CapEx forecasts are flattening out, and sentiment amongst customers and dealers has been a little bit better, and that's good. On the concern side, in addition to commodity prices, North American construction over the last -- in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter is weaker than we would have thought a few months ago. And if that continues, that would be concerning next year as well. Hopefully, with all the election noise behind us, and particularly if we get some investment in U.S. infrastructure, that could help. But right now, I would think, on balance, it looks pretty tough. 
Economic growth in Europe, it's been kind of okay, but we're still concerned about Brexit. And as that draws nearer, the concerns that we have are, does it impact economic growth and business confidence and investment? 
I think another fallout from the lower oil prices has been power gen, particularly in the oil-producing regions. That's -- it's very weak now, and we don't see anything in the short term that's going to change that around. 
And also kind of related to commodities in a way, marine, particularly for offshore service vessels, we're concerned about. And rail remains a very weak industry, particularly in North America. And industrial engine sales to ag customers, that's loose engine sales that we sell to ag customers, and particularly ag and some power gen packagers remain pretty weak. 
I know, with Solar, it's always a topic of discussion. So I thought I would kind of give you the -- our current view of Solar as well. So right now, we've had a pretty stable backlog. Based on where it's at right now, it would give us expectations that Solar would be about flat next year with this year. I know you're concerned about how this will play out by segment, and I would tell you that it's not a lot. I mean, when we say not significantly different than '17, by and large, that's probably pretty similar across most of the segments. I would say probably slightly more negative with Energy & Transportation than, say, Resource Industries, which is at such a low bottom. I mean, new equipment sales in -- for the big mining product is down 80% to 90% since 2012. Not as much room there for downside. 
So with that, we'll just wrap up with a few discussion points on Page 11. Not much change over the past quarter in the industries we serve, with the exception of North American construction, which has disappointed. We've had great operational performance, and that's not just cost reduction. Our market position vis-à-vis our competitors was better this quarter than a year ago for our machines and continues to improve in China. Our decrementals in every single segment were very good year-over-year, cost reduction -- and that's driven by cost reduction, which is quite substantial. We're pretty well on track with restructuring. Most of the things that -- of any magnitude that we were considering a year ago in September with that announcement have been made public. Balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to -- our ME&T debt-to-cap is 37% at the end of the quarter. And we had a cash balance of over $6 billion, and we're still thinking that this year will be a positive free cash flow. 
So with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for questions."

But we said this in the release, I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year, and we're -- the flattish for the year relies on a bit of improvement in the second half of the year. So I think, to your point on costs, I would suspect, as we wrap this up, we will be planning and trying to set a cost structure for something that's probably a little bit more conservative than where we're thinking sales for the year could be. So there will remain a very big focus on cost and cost reduction. Won't get into too many of the details yet. As you know, we're kind of in the middle of our planning process for next year right now. But I think some big things that you can certainly expect, one, we'll have a big headwind. I don't know how much yet, but we'll likely have a pretty sizable headwind on incentive compensation. This year, we're pretty -- we're off of our outlook in most areas, off of our plan. So we'll have less-than-expected short-term incentive comps this year for all of our employees and something more normal going into next year could be a headwind of $500 million, $600 million, depending upon where the executive team and the board sets the target. So that would be a headwind. On the positive side, we've done very well on costs. We've taken out more cost as we've gone along this year. So we'll have some benefits from a carryover impact of that. So that should be a tailwind. We've done very well on material costs. And again, much of the commodity benefit and material costs, with the rise in commodity prices, has come out. But even without commodity changes, we've done very well on sourcing and design with material cost. So I think we would see that as a tailwind for next year. So we're still working on all the other items in the plan. And when we get to January, we'll definitely do a more complete review of sales and the profit drivers."

I -- it -- predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter -- and this will be a plus or minus probably a couple hundred million dollars,",289,"Yes. I -- it -- predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter -- and this will be a plus or minus probably a couple hundred million dollars, but probably something around -- dealer inventory, in its totality, around $1.5 billion decline this year, with probably somewhere close to half of that coming out in the fourth quarter of this year. So we are not currently producing to end-market demand. This year, let's say, order of magnitude, $1.5 billion lower. Now when you start talking about next year, I'll tell you what makes it really difficult to predict. It depends a lot -- how we'll end the year will depend a lot on how the second half of the year turns out and what expectations for 2018 are. So for example, if things start improving in the middle of next year and there's confidence that 2018 is going to be a better year, part of dealer inventory is thinking about what's going to be needed for the future, not what was needed in the past. So that would tend to help dealer inventory. If 2018 looks bad, if there's some sort of a world event and dealers are more pessimistic, there would likely be some additional dealer inventory reduction. I think it -- I think we'll probably be in a better position to talk about that maybe more in January, but I would say, in our current estimates, we do continue to have some level of dealer inventory reduction in for next year. I guess, at this point, let's just call it a placeholder, but probably not as much as this year."

We do the work based on which of our business it's in, and that goodwill is spread across more than one business. And also, remember that some of the goodwill was -- or the intangibles and goodwill changed after we acquired Bucyrus and sold a portion of it to dealers. So some of it left already. We -- in our K last year, we provided more color on goodwill. And the segment that has more of the -- or that had -- the closest a year ago to triggering an impairment, I think, if memory serves me, it was about 15% off. That segment houses about $1.2 billion of the goodwill. So it's -- we don't have a Bucyrus. Everybody wants to think we do. But it's been integrated in -- across a couple of different businesses within the company. And so the measurement is not just Bucyrus because it doesn't exist.

Dealers are -- like I said a minute ago, dealers are planning to cut inventory in the fourth quarter, so I think, naturally, they're ordering less. We would certainly expect a pickup in orders in the first quarter as they want to build some inventory for the second quarter selling season. In the case of Solar, backlog is reasonable. And based on everything we know about history, should be reasonably in line with the flat year next year. So how confident are we in next year's sort of preliminary view? I think we're confident that the first half will definitely be challenged. And I guess, if you want to read into that down, I think that's probably a reasonable way to think of it. How confident are we that the back half of the year will improve? I think that will depend largely on what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. construction, and whether or not this trend of maybe parts sales firming in construction happens and whether or not we start to see orders from mining companies, which we haven't seen much of so far. We're encouraged by the commodity prices, the sentiment, the discussion on CapEx, but to the -- probably to the point that you're making, that has not turned into orders of any magnitude yet.

And I wish our intel on that was -- we were -- I wish we were able to break down all the reasons and causes for everything that goes on within dealer inventory. There's usually a reasonable band in terms of months of supply, and you kind of have to look at it in a band. It's not a static kind of -- it depends a lot on, is the bias up or is the bias down on future sales, because that will color a lot what dealers hold. How we're -- to your point, how we're shipping, are we meeting shipping commitments? Are they relatively quick? Can they get what they want when they need it? And sort of that kind of puts a downward bias on what they want to hold as well. The flip side of that is, if we're on allocation, they want to order as much as they can get, and they want to hold as much as they can keep. So there's not a hard and fast rule. But somewhere in the sort of maybe 3 months on the low end, 3.5, is probably a reasonable band. And for the most part, we're in that band. And you have to even take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it depends upon kind of what the product mix is of what's being sold. So if it were all small machines that we sell that we can provide delivery on in 8 weeks, it provides a little different dealer dynamic than if it's big machines that take 6 months. But I guess, the gist of my answer would be I don't think there's any massive excess of dealer inventory. I think we all would like to get dealer inventory down. It's just more efficient for us and dealers if we can deliver quickly what they want, what they need. In an ultimate world, wouldn't it be great if they didn't have to have any inventory and we could just ship them everything in 1 day?

So if you think about our business in construction, the heavy construction and rental are pretty decent-sized businesses for us. If you look at construction in North America, housing seems to be motoring on and has been okay. The problem we find ourselves in, I think, is the larger projects, the infrastructure spending is maybe not quite as robust as housing would be right now, and that's a bigger sweet spot for us. We had -- we have this other dynamic going on, and I'll try to describe it like this. We have too much used equipment in the marketplace right now, and used equipment prices are fairly depressed. And so what that causes in rental, particularly with our rental channel through CAT dealers, is it does not provide much of an incentive for dealers to sell off their used equipment and refresh fleets. So we're seeing the rent -- our sales into the rental channel as pretty challenged right now. And I talked about construction equipment in Resource Industries, in particular, articulated trucks. We had quite a bit more rental loading earlier in the year than we've seen here in the back half of the year. So I think, hopefully, sentiment will improve. We'll get the election out of the way, we'll have a new government that's interested in infrastructure spending. And somewhere 6 months to a year down the road, maybe that will turn into something better. But right now, I think we're on the fence and concerned about overall construction in North America."

Part of that was sourcing and design and part of that was commodities. The commodity piece of it has mostly evaporated this year. The cost reduction that we're getting is mostly sourcing and design. That will continue. But I think higher commodity prices will mean not so much a headwind on material cost in total, because we'll still have considerable sourcing and design changes. We're always out there doing that. But I think it'll be certainly less of a -- at this point in time anyway, I'd say it'd be less of a tailwind as we look into next year. But now all that said, we would take higher commodity prices in a heartbeat. I mean, if we had to decide between high commodity prices or low commodity prices, the impact on our sales would beat the impact on our material cost substantially."
