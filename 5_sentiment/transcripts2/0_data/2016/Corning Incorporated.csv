As we reported in this morning's press release, we met and in a few places exceeded our expectations in quarter 4 and also beat consensus. With that said, year-over-year results in most of our businesses were impacted by the weak global economy, the stronger dollar versus other currencies and continued softness in the TV and IT for retail markets. We expect these headwinds to continue in quarter 1. Despite the macroeconomic challenges we faced in quarter 4, we had several major successes executing against the strategy and capital allocation framework that we introduced in October. The framework, which described our leadership for the next 4 years is simple, we will focus on our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, create significant value and return cash to our shareholders. Also told you in October, over the course of the next 4 years, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more of than $10 billion  to our shareholders, which is, by the way, roughly half of our current market cap. And we will invest $10 billion in our growth and to sustain our industry leadership. We are confident this new framework was drive the company forward and guide our value creation in 2016 and beyond.
So let me just take a few minutes to highlight our recent successes under this framework. We generated more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow in 2015 despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. This is good evidence of our ability to generate a cash flow that underpins our capital allocation plan. We're off to a good start on our commitment to return more than $10 billion to our shareholders with a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program that we completed last week. We continue to focus on our portfolio with the recent announcement of the strategic realignment of our interest in Dow Corning Corporation. As we indicated when we announced the transaction, we are very proud of Dow Corning's success over the last 72 years. However, Dow Corning's silicons business lies outside of our 3-core technologies for manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Given Dow's strong synergies with the silicons business, we believe the transaction unlocks the value of Dow Corning for our shareholders. 
When we close this transaction, Corning will exchange its 50% interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed Dow Corning entity. Dow will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Corning. In reality, we own approximately 40% interest in Hemlock semiconductor and approximately $4.8 billion of cash. We believe that our ownership interest in Hemlock and additional $4.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet creates significant value. $4.8 billion is approximately a 50x multiple on the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicons business, and it's important to remember that we expect the realignment to be essentially tax free. This additional cash increases the amount of funds available for deployment from the $22 billion to $26 billion we discussed in October the $26 billion to $30 billion to 2019. We will provide more details on how we intend to deploy this cash when we close the transaction.
In support of our commitment to utilize our market access platforms and financial strength to grow, we leveraged our competitive advantages and strengthened customer relationships in display to stabilize returns.  First, we established a long-term supply agreement in the low-cash investment in a 10 -- 10.5 glass manufacturing facility adjacent to . By utilizing others fundings, we significantly derisked this transaction, so we expect outstanding returns. The investment total is $1.3 billion. Our cash investment, however, is 1/4 of that at $290 million. And at that level, exceeds our targets of obtaining $2 of every $3 from others when we invest in new melting capacity. And second, we maintained favorable pricing for LCD glass into quarter 4. It's no secret to any of you that the display industry is experiencing significant challenges. While retail market for TV and IT softened in the back half for 2015 and supply chain reeks of inventory grew. Despite these market dynamics, our fourth quarter sequential price decline was the lowest of the year.
Stepping back and looking at 2015 as a whole, the display industry had its most challenging year in the last 5 years on a number of dimensions: First, it was the lowest end market growth in area terms over the last 5 years; second, panel price declines were the highest they have been in 5 years; and finally, the year ended with the highest level of inventory in the supply chain over the past 5 years. Now even in this environment, we had the smallest annual price decline for glass in 5 years. This is important evidence that we're making significant progress on stabilizing our returns in display. And as you will hear in a moment from Tony, that trend continues in quarter 1 of this year. And finally, evidence continues to build that we will successfully leverage our automotive market access platforms to disrupt the 6 billion square foot auto glazing market to drive growth for Corning. We made 2 significant announcements: First, in December, we announced that Ford will use Corning Gorilla Glass in the iconic Ford GT. This is the first production vehicle to use Gorilla Glass for multiple glazing applications, including the windshield, rear engine cover and acoustic separator. It's a great example of leveraging our market access with the world's leading automakers to pursue disruptive opportunities while utilizing our existing fusion assets. This collaboration demonstrates what Corning does best, applying expertise in glass and material science to help industry leaders solve tough challenges, unleash new capabilities and enhance experiences for their customers.
Second, just last week, we announced a joint venture with Saddleback secure it to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saddleback is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to these JV and other glazers retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer. This provides a low-cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions across the globe. 
So to summarize, we're making solid progress delivering on our new framework. We are generating a strong and sustainable operating cash, unlocking significant value for shareholders and focusing our portfolio by removing assets outside our core capabilities; leveraging our 3-core technologies, 4 manufacturing engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms to deliver strong financial performance; and we're turning cash to shareholders. So we will clearly face economic headwinds in the first half of 2016. Our confidence continues to build in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony who will review our fourth quarter results and first quarter outlook."

Before I get into the details, there are 2 hot topics with investors where I want to provide an update: LCD pricing and the end hedging after 2017. Starting with the LCD glass pricing, I'll spend a few minutes giving you our perspective on our display industry dynamics and explain why we are increasingly confident that our strategy to stabilize returns will work.
Let's start with the end market. To recap 2015, it was a challenging year for the industry, driven by the fall-off in demand in retail. TV demand was actually down in several regions. Specifically, TV demand in Europe and Latin America was weaker due to the effect of the stronger dollar on retail prices and continued economic uncertainty. Taken as a whole, worldwide TV unit sell-through was down low single digits. On an area basis, the unit decline was more than offset by an average screen size growth of more than 1 inch. In addition, IT and mobile demand was weak, driven by lack of replacement drivers, the strong dollar and continued economic uncertainty. We estimate the worldwide IT market was down 6% in area in 2015. In total, the glass market at retail was up about 2% in 2015 as measured in area. As a result of the lower end market demand, supply chain inventory grew. Panel price declines began to accelerate and panel makers begin lower utilizations in Q3 and lowered them again in Q4. Panel prices fell 30% to 40% for the year, with most sizes approaching cash cost. While inventories decreased in Q4, they are still at a high level.
However, that said, coming into 2016, we expect end-market demand to recover in units and for average TV screen size to continue to grow. Specifically, we expect sellthrough units to be up low single digits and for average screen size to grow at least 1.5 inches. We think demand for IT and units will be consistent with 2015 and screen sizes will grow slightly. As you can see on the slide, the biggest contributor to glass area growth is screen size. TV screen size growth annually, driven by affordability. As TV prices decline, consumers can buy a bigger TV for the same price. For example, today, you can purchase a 50-inch TV for the same price of a 42-inch TV in 2013. 
Now for TV units. TV units were down low single digits last year. History tells us that when you have a year with compressed TV consumption, you typically get a rebound the following year. Other drivers supporting growth in 2016 are: Lower panel prices will have a positive effect on TV retail prices and will, therefore, increase demand; the U.S. dollar appreciation is less likely to continue; and we expect an improved economy in Western Europe. As a result, we expect worldwide TV unit sell-through to be up about 2%. So for this full year, we expect demand for LCD glass and retail to grow in the high single digits. We will share more details on our market Outlook for LCD in the February -- in February at our Investor Meeting. 
Now let's turn to the display supply chain and look how the end market, in terms of glass sellthrough, interact with less demand. On this chart, the green line is end market demand and the blue line is glass market demand. When the green line is below the blue, panel makers are running at higher utilizations to build inventory to support an upcoming retail season. When it's below, inventory is being depleted by fall-through at retail. You can see at a timeframe of Q1 to Q3 of '15, the glass market was flat because panel makers were maintaining utilizations in anticipation of the retail season, and it resulted in a significant inventory build. Beginning in the third quarter of '15 through Q1 of '16, glass market demand is lower as panel makers utilization -- as panel makers lower utilizations in reaction to falling panel prices and a weaker end market. Panel maker utilizations and the glass market are expected to be down sequentially in Q1, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. The combination of a healthier supply chain in end market growth will lead to panel maker utilizations increasing and our glass volume growing as the year progresses. We expect this to start in the second quarter. 
Now to sum up the year for glass demand. In Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid- to high single digits. The good news is that lower panel utilizations will help draw down inventory. We expect glass demand to resume strongly in the second half, and we expect glass demand for the full year to grow in the mid-single digits. 
Now let's turn to the bright spot, glass pricing. Pricing in 2015 was the best in 5 years. Q4 price declines were less than any other quarter last year, and we expect glass prices in Q1 to decline moderately sequentially. The price decline in Q1 is typically the highest quarterly decline of every year because Q1 is when annual supply agreements are finalized. Our moderate Q1 price decline this year equals the best Q1 declines we've seen in 5 years despite this very tough environment. We think our display strategy passed a significant test, and a Q1 pricing is a strong indicator that we can maintain favorable pricing going forward and deliver on stabilizing returns.
Now moving to the yen. As a quick refresher, we sell our display glass in yen. We have hedged in 2017 at an average rate of 99. With this stability, our hedging program to our display cash flows, investors naturally ask, ""what happens in 2018 and beyond?"" Our response is that we'll consider extending our hedge position as we gain certainty on our future yen flows and when the currency market offers an attractive yen-dollar rate opportunity. We are happy to announce progress on this front. 
Late last year, we extended our long-term supply agreements with our 2 largest customers. We extended our agreement with Samsung and BOE through 2025 and 2028, respectively. This greatly increases our confidence in future yen flows. On the rate front, I'm sure you all noted the recent volatility in the currency market and the great strengthening of the yen. We took advantage of this opportunity to add to our hedge position. At this point, we are hedged for approximately 70% of our anticipated yen flow from the time period of 2016 to 2022 at an average rate of 106. For those investors who were concerned about our yen exposure beyond 2017, this action will greatly mitigate those concerns. Because our capital allocation framework factored in weak yen scenarios, the additional hedges give us -- give upside to our expected operating cash flow in our  4-year plan. So while the yen will always be an important topic, we significantly reduced the downside risks and increased the certainty in our ability to return greater than $10 billion to shareholders over the next 4 years.
Now let's get into fourth quarter financials. For the quarter, we met, and in few places exceeded, our expectations, and we also beat consensus. As a reminder, these are our core results. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion and higher than consensus. This was down 5% versus last year's strong fourth quarter. Corporate gross margin was 42% as expected. This is consistent with Q3 but lower than last year. Most of our businesses have a relatively high fixed cost structure. Therefore, the decreased sales lower our gross margin as a percentage of sales versus last year. S&A and RD&E  were down versus last year in absolute dollars. S&A was a bit higher than we expected due to external fees associated with our external transactions. These expenses are onetime in nature, and we do not expect them to repeat. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower-than-expected. Congress passed the Extenders bill in December, and this reduced our tax expense by approximately $20 million. Net income was $429 million and lower than last year. The lower earnings reflect the lower volumes, mainly in display, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, last year, we received payment regarding an IT dispute that did not repeat. The EPS was $0.34 and exceeded consensus. For the full year, our sales and earnings reflected the macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the year. 
Now let's look at detailed segment results beginning with Display Technologies. Display performance in Q4 was in line with our guidance. Volume was down slightly, price declines were moderate as expected and the lower sequential decline in 2015. Display sales were $903 million and net income was $234 million. As a reminder, in Q4 last year, we received the payment regarding an IT dispute that did not repeat. As anticipated, in the fourth quarter, panel makers again lower utilizations in response to the softer end market I already mentioned, which resulted in volume down low single digits for the glass market. Our volume was down slightly sequentially, a bit better than market declines due to a favorable resolution of a customer dispute leading to a recovery of a missed volume at that customer. Sequentially, fourth quarter price declines were moderate as expected and declined less than in Q3. During the quarter, we secured the majority of our 2016 volume under customer agreements, helping us maintain stable share, which in turn, enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing cost. 
Display sales were down 8% for the full year and net income was down 14%. The reduction in net income is a result of the slower growth of the LCD glass market and retail in 2015 that I already spoke to. We had many accomplishments in display in 2015. I already talked about a the pricing. We extended long-term supply agreements with 2 major customers that build to the middle of the next decade. The integration of CPM continues to go well. And we exceeded our synergy targets. And finally, we reduced cost by more than 10%, and we continue to maintain our significant cost leadership.
Now moving to optical communications, which performed better than our guidance. Q4 sales were $736 million and up 9% versus last year, driven by acquisitions and growth in fiber-to-the-home. This was better-than-expected, driven by stronger carrier network sales. Net income was $47 million in Q4. Net income was down 2% versus last year, which is not what you would expect with sales growth. This is mostly about mix. We had less of our sales in our higher-margin data center integrated solutions and more of our sales in lower margin products like cable from our newly acquired Korean operation. We also experienced higher cost in our fiber business. We are addressing the cost issue, and we expect overall profitability to improve in 2016. For the full year, we are very pleased with optical communications performance, which well exceeded our goal of growing more than 2x the telecom industry CapEx rate. Sales were up 12% to $3 billion, driven by growth in nearly all parts of our business. Sales would've been up 16% without the impact of FX. Net income was up 28% and significantly more than sales growth. The improved profitability was driven by the additional volume in fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions and strong manufacturing performance.
In the Environmental, Q4 performance was also better than expectations. Q4 sales were $254 million, up 2% versus last year. Without the impact of FX, sales would've been up 5%. During the quarter, China implemented a stimulus program for car  sales, and that drove demand for light-duty products higher-than-expected. Soft demand in China for heavy-duty products continued. The year-over-year profitability was down as expected and similar to Q3. That was driven mostly by the weaker euro and lower volume in the heavy-duty China market. 
For the full year, sales were down 4% and net income was down 12%. Sales would've been up 2% without the impact of FX and profitability would've been consistent with record 2014 performance. 
In 2015, we expected growth in the global auto market, and we expected another year of growth in North America and China heavy-duty truck production. We invested capacity to support this growth. We grew and expected in all market, except for China, where heavy-duty truck builds were down 30% and China's auto growth, while stronger in Q4, was less than expected for the full year. As we start 2016, we see continued strength in the auto market but are being impacted in our heavy-duty segment in China, and now in North America, which is coming off a 2-year peak. As a result, we are carrying costs associated with the capacity that is currently underutilized but is ready and will deliver expanding margins when market volumes resume. We have taken action on cost, which continues to the first half, and we expect gross margin percentages to improve year-over-year, beginning in the second half of 2016.
Moving onto Specialty Materials, which performed in line with guidance. Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q4 '14, as we expected. This reflected the reduction in supply chain builds compared to a very strong build in Q4 '14. Sales were $275 million and net income was $44 million. Segment net income was up 40% in Q4, mainly due to improved gross margins in Gorilla versus last year, aided by Gorilla Glass 4 prices, improved cost and the not repeat of a onetime unfavorable item last year. 
For the full year, Specialty Materials sales were down 8%, driven by lower sales of Advanced Optics. Sales in Advanced Optics were down related to the completion of a large aerospace and defense program, softer demand in the semiconductor industry and the weaker euro. Net income, on the other hand, was up 11%, driven by Gorilla Glass volume growth, adoption of Gorilla Glass 4 and cost reductions. We are pleased with our Gorilla Glass business. The market demand for covered glass was up approximately 10% in 2015, and we gained share with the big China OEMs in touch notebooks. Additionally, the successful introduction and adoption of higher-priced Gorilla Glass 4 had a very favorable impact on our profitability.
In life sciences, Q4 sales were $202 million. Both sales and net income were down year-over-year driven by foreign exchange. For the full year, sales were down 5% and net income was down 12%. But both would have been up excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Q4 Gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $78 million as expected. Hemlock contributed $39 million of the total, up from Q3, driven by customers' fulfilling their annual contracts. For the full year, Dow Corning's equity earnings were $245 million.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $628 million and over $1 billion of adjusted operating cash flow. For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and spent $1.25 billion on CapEx and had free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As Wendell indicated, more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow for the full year really gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our capital allocation plan.
During the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. This reflects our accelerated stock repurchase program. For the full year, we spent $3.2 billion on new purchases and lowered outstanding shares by 151 million shares. We ended the year with $4.6 billion of cash, with approximately $1 billion in the U.S..
Now for the Outlook. We expect the global economic headwinds to persist in the first quarter and to impact our business  in all of our businesses year-over-year. We expect the first quarter to be the weakest in 2016, and we anticipate to gradually recover in subsequent quarters. 
Let's begin by looking at each of our businesses. This morning, I will provide our Q1 expectations with some additional color on the full year. You can expect to hear more about our business outlooks at our upcoming IR day. 
Beginning with display. To repeat what I said earlier in the call, in Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid- to high single digits, driven by lower panel maker utilizations that I already mentioned. Once the supply chain returns to normal, we expect panel maker utilizations and our glass volumes to grow. We expect this growth to start in Q2. We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially. Given how our contracts work, we are confident that the price declines would be moderate in the quarter. As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for 2 primary reasons: First, the financial situation of our competitors indicate that they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable; and second, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced throughout the recent weakening in panel demand. We are keeping capacity offline to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that our quarter-over-quarter price comparisons will be better for us going forward than they have been overall in the past. So to summarize display, we expect our volume in Q1 to reflect the weaker retail market and lower panel market utilizations, and we will manage supply to demand. We do not believe that the current economic environment reflects any fundamental change to our longer-term drivers of TV demand and that the end market will recover in 2016.
Moving to Optical Communications. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be at low- to mid-single digits versus last year. For the full year, we expect our sales to be at mid-single digits and exceed our goal of at least 2x the overall industry CapEx growth rates. 
Turning to Environmental. The U.S. heavy-duty truck market is forecasted to be down about 20% in 2016 after a 2-year peak, and we also expect China's heavy-duty market to remain weak. This will impact our heavy-duty volume and segment sales in Q1. We expect sales to be down approximately 10% versus last year. We do expect auto production to increase this year, but we do not expect it to offset the lower heavy-duty demand and continued FX strain. So our Outlook for the full year is for environmental sales to be down slightly from 2015. 
For Specialty Materials, we expect Gorilla Glass volume to grow in the high single digits this year. However, in Q1, segment sales are expected to decline mid-teens year-over-year and primarily to the absence of our ramp for new product launches by mobile device manufacturers like we had in Q1 of '15. For the full year, we anticipate double-digit sales in net income growth in Specialty Materials, driven by Gorilla Glass. In life sciences, we expect Q1 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, with underlying growth offset by the weaker euro. For the full year, we expect to grow sales faster than the market, which is expected to be up low single digits. 
Continuing with the rest of our Q1 forecast. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. This is a 1-point decline sequentially due to the expected lower display and lower Gorilla Glass volume. We expect gross margin to improve as volumes in our businesses starting in the second quarter. SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $50 million. We expect Q1 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $45 million. This is down from Q4 were polysilicon customers met annual contract obligations. For the full year, we expect slight growth in both silicons and polysilicon sales. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 16% to 17% range. That concludes our outlook for the first quarter. Now I will hand the call back to Wendell to summarize before we go to Q&A."

I think that there is -- the important thing to keep in mind when we look at our growth on sales on a year-over-year basis in glass in retail, what really drives a lot of that growth, of course is what happens with the screen size. As you saw on the chart that we presented, that's the biggest single driver of our growth on a year-over-year basis. We think sales are going to be up 2% TV unit sales in a year-over-year basis. It could be a little bit weaker than that. But we think our range of being up in the high single digits. We feel pretty good about that a lot of that actually has it do with the screen size growth."

Second question I wanted to ask. Tony, was on the hedging. Can you talk about the phase of the hedging? So you said 70% coverage.

On the macro front, bottom line is, we're planning a not-that-exciting an economy in this coming year. Where you see us recovering as the year goes on mainly has to do with the supply-chain correction in display and some pick up in some very specific areas where we have very high margin product sets like in Gorilla and in some particular market segments in opta that has less to do with the economy and do, which is the cycle of product introductions or where they are in their build cycles. But in general, we are with you. We don't see that much good news in the economy here in the near-term. On the yen though, it fades. What Tony and his team managed to do here is the coverage is still quite high all the way out for a lot of years. So in many ways, this is just locked off the downside risk of the yen. In the compliments I would make to him and to his team is, once we got in place the long-term supply agreements, give us confidence that we're going to have the yen flows. Then, we just by time and disciplined waiting for what we need to be about a moment in the market, the yen would strengthen and then we have in place all the trades that would make it close at a rate that we think is attractive and our shareholders  a good [indiscernible] So in opto, actually, opto is really strong throughout the year. We think it could get stronger because we had 2 areas sort of low cycle in Quarter 4. And somewhat in Quarter 1, which is sort of the ultra data center market. And were sort of in between big bills and fiber-to-the-home, right? We're sort of ramping it up and Australia. We've got new ones on board that were going to be coming on stream. So right now, Opto continues to feel strong mainly because of how superior our product set is and the extent that we're really beating the competition in all of our core high-value ads."

We're hitting on really 3 things during the value prop. The first is lightweight. Now despite the low gas prices, all of the car companies have, sort of by ranks, have a target for what they have the increase miles per gallon for their fleet. So they are all very interested in lightweight-ing the vehicle. They have specific numbers in mind that they pay for every pound or kilo that they save. And with us being able to serve greater than 30% of reduced weight by greater than 30% of glazing at a price point that looks attractive in terms of those weight buys, that gets traction. But what we're also able to do is actually increase the safety of the vehicle. Because even though we're going lighter weight, basically, what happens is when you have something like a rock strike, it can penetrate the outer layer of the glass but it doesn't penetrate Gorilla. As well to that safety component is what we've been able to show is dramatically reduce windshield replacements. Is that something like a sharp rock basically we could save almost half of windshield replacement. Because once again, the glass reacts in a much stronger, tougher way. So you don't end up with those classic cracks that can happen from thermal shock after you had damage introduced to the glass from something sharp or blood for that matter. And then finally, it's an enhanced experience for the driver begins here you're looking up purely optical piece of glass right? You make this on the same asset sets through we make display, right? So this piece of glass and because it's thinner, allows you to have both displays that are 70% or more thinner and tremendously clearer. Being one of the things then out of consumer electronic show. And you'll get a chance to see it at our IR Day is take a look would build in conjunction with County is was the biggest hub manufacturer in the world. And what they said is that we have never seen a hub display like this. It's incredible, far and away. So it's all of those 3 things. Are we getting or without doubt. People are really excited about it. Now, to calm us all down, damn, this industry moves slow, okay? So it's just a very conservative industry for good reason, right? So man, it's going to take time for us to build, which is why we keep pointing to this proof points along the way. We'll know where we are long before the volume shows up.

As we reported in this morning's press release, we met, and in a few places, exceeded our expectations in quarter 4 and also beat consensus. With that said, year-over-year results in most of our businesses were impacted by the weak global economy, the stronger dollar versus other currencies and continued softness in the TV and IT for retail markets. We expect the headwinds to continue in quarter 1. 
Despite the macroeconomic challenges we faced in quarter 4, we had several major successes executing against the strategy and capital allocation framework that we introduced in October. The framework, which described our leadership priorities for the next 4, years is simple: we will focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, create significant value and return cash to our shareholders. As we told you in October, over the course of the next 4 years, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more of that $10 billion to our shareholders, which is, by the way, roughly half of our current market cap. And we will invest $10 billion in our growth and to sustain our industry leadership. We are confident this new framework will drive the company forward and guide our value creation in 2016 and beyond.
So let me just take a few minutes to highlight our recent successes under this framework. We generated more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow in 2015 despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. This is good evidence of our ability to generate the cash flow that underpins our capital allocation plan. 
We're off to a good start on our commitment to return more than $10 billion to our shareholders with a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program that we completed last week. 
We continue to focus our portfolio with the recent announcement of the strategic realignment of our interest in Dow Corning Corporation. As we indicated when we announced the transaction, we're very proud of Dow Corning's success over the last 72 years. However, Dow Corning's silicones business lies outside our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Given Dow's strong synergies with the silicones business, we believe the transaction unlocks the value of Dow Corning for our shareholders. 
When we close this transaction, Corning will exchange its 50% interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed Dow Corning entity that will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Corning. The new entity, we will own approximately 40% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor and approximately $4.8 billion of cash. We believe that our ownership interest in Hemlock and additional $4.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet create significant value. $4.8 billion is approximately a 30x multiple on the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business and it's important to remember that we expect the realignment to be essentially tax-free. This additional cash increases the amount of funds available for deployment from the $22 billion to $26 billion we discussed in October to $26 billion to $30 billion to 2019. We will provide more details on how we intend to deploy this cash when we close the transaction.
In support of our commitment to utilize our market access platforms and financial strength to grow, we leveraged our competitive advantages and strengthened customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns.  First, we established a long-term supply agreement and a low-cash investment in a Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility adjacent to BOE. By utilizing others fundings, we significantly derisked this transaction and we expect outstanding returns. The investment total is $1.3 billion. Our cash investment, however, is 1/4 of that at $290 million, and at that level, exceeds our target of obtaining $2 of every $3 from others when we invest in new melting capacity. 
And second, we obtained favorable pricing for LCD glass until quarter 4. It's no secret to any of you that the display industry is experiencing significant challenges. The retail market for TV and IT softened in the back half of 2015, and supply chain weeks of inventory grew. Despite these market dynamics, our fourth quarter sequential price declines were the lowest of the year.
Stepping back and looking at 2015 as a whole, the display industry had its most challenging year in the last 5 years on a number of dimensions: first, it was the lowest end market growth in area terms over the last 5 years; second, panel price declines were the highest they have been in 5 years; and finally, the year ended with the highest level of inventory in the supply chain over the past 5 years. Now even in this environment, we had the smallest annual price decline for glass in 5 years. This is important evidence that we're making significant progress on stabilizing our returns in Display, and as you will hear in a moment from Tony, that trend continues in quarter 1 of this year. 
And finally, evidence continues to build that we will successfully leverage our automotive market access platform to disrupt the 6-billion square foot auto glazing market to drive growth for Corning. We made 2 significant announcements: first, in December, we announced that Ford will use Corning Gorilla Glass in the iconic Ford GT. This is the first production vehicle to use Gorilla Glass for multiple glazing applications including the windshield, rear engine cover and acoustic separator. It's a great example of leveraging our market access with the world's leading automakers to pursue disruptive opportunities while utilizing our existing fusion assets. This collaboration demonstrates what Corning does best: applying expertise in glass and material science to help industry leaders solve tough challenges, unleash new capabilities and enhance experiences for their customers.
Second, just last week, we announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Gobain is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to this JV and other glazers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer. This provides a low-cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions across the globe. 
So to summarize. We're making solid progress delivering on our new framework. We are generating strong and sustainable operating cash, unlocking significant value for shareholders and focusing our portfolio by removing assets outside our core capabilities; leveraging our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms to deliver strong financial performance; and we're returning cash to shareholders. Though we will clearly face economic headwinds in the first half of 2016, our confidence continues to build in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony who will review our fourth quarter results and first quarter outlook."

Before I get into the details, there are 2 hot topics with investors where I want to provide an update: LCD pricing and yen hedging after 2017. 
Starting with the LCD glass pricing, I'll spend a few minutes giving you our perspective on the display industry dynamics and explain why we are increasingly confident that our strategy to stabilize returns will work.
Let's start with the end market. To recap 2015, it was a challenging year for the industry driven by the fall-off in demand at retail. TV unit demand was actually down in several regions. Specifically, TV demand in Europe and Latin America was weaker due to the effect of the stronger dollar on retail prices and continued economic uncertainty. Taken as a whole, worldwide TV unit sell-through was down low single digits. On an area basis, the unit decline was more than offset by an average screen size growth of more than 1 inch. In addition, IT and mobile demand was weak, driven by lack of replacement drivers, the strong dollar and continued economic uncertainty. We estimate the worldwide IT market was down 6% in area in 2015. In total, the glass market at retail was up about 3% in 2015 as measured in area. 
As a result of the lower end market demand, supply chain inventory grew. Panel price declines began to accelerate and panel makers began lower utilizations in Q3 and lowered them again in Q4. Panel prices fell 30% to 40% for the year with most sizes approaching cash cost. While inventories decreased in Q4, they are still at a high level.
All of that said, coming into 2016, we expect end market demand to recover in units and for average TV screen size to continue to grow. Specifically, we expect sell-through units to be up low single digits and for average screen size to grow at least 1.5 inches. We think demand for IT in units will be consistent with 2015 and screen sizes will grow slightly. As you can see on the slide, the biggest contributor to glass area growth is screen size. TV screen size grow annually driven by affordability. As TV prices decline, consumers can buy a bigger TV for the same price. For example, today, you can purchase a 50-inch TV for the same price as a 42-inch TV in 2013. 
Now for TV units. TV units were down low single digits last year. History tells us that when you have a year with compressed TV consumption, you typically get a rebound the following year. Other drivers supporting growth in 2016 are: lower panel prices will have a positive effect on TV retail prices and will therefore increase demand, the U.S. dollar appreciation is less likely to continue and we expect an improved economy in Western Europe. As a result, we expect worldwide TV unit sell-through to be up about 2%. So for the full year, we expect demand for LCD glass at retail to grow in the high single digits. We will share more details on our market outlook for LCD in the February -- in February at our investor meeting. 
Now let's turn to the display supply chain and look how the end market, in terms of glass sell-through, interacts with glass demand. On this chart, the green line is end market demand and the blue line is glass market demand. When the green line is below the blue, panel makers are running at higher utilizations to build inventory to support an upcoming retail season. When it's below, inventory is being depleted by pull-through at retail. You can see in the time frame of Q1 to Q3 of '15 the glass market was flat because panel makers were maintaining utilizations in anticipation of the retail season and it resulted in a significant inventory build. Beginning in the third quarter of '15 through Q1 of '16, glass market demand is lower as panel maker utilization -- as panel makers lower utilizations in reaction to falling panel prices and a weaker end market. Panel maker utilizations and the glass market are expected to be down sequentially in Q1, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. The combination of a healthier supply chain and end market growth will lead to panel maker utilizations increasing and our glass volume growing as the year progresses. We expect this to start in the second quarter. 
Now to sum up the year for glass demand. In Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid- to high single digits. The good news is that lower panel maker utilizations will help drive down inventory. We expect glass demand to resume strongly in the second half and we expect glass demand for the full year to grow in the mid-single digits. 
Now let's turn to the bright spot, glass pricing. Pricing in 2015 was the best in 5 years. Q4 price declines were less than any other quarter last year, and we expect glass prices in Q1 to decline moderately sequentially. The price decline in Q1 is typically the highest quarterly decline of every year because Q1 is when annual supply agreements are finalized. Our moderate Q1 price decline this year equals the best Q1 decline we've seen in 5 years despite this very tough environment. We think our display strategy passed a significant test and that Q1 pricing is a strong indicator that we can maintain favorable pricing going forward and deliver on stabilizing returns.
Now moving to the yen. As a quick refresher, we sell our display glass in yen. We have hedged till 2017 at an average rate of $99. With the stability our hedging program gives to our Display cash flows, investors naturally ask what happens in 2018 and beyond? Our response is that we'll consider extending our hedge position as we gain certainty on our future yen flows and when the currency market offers an attractive yen-dollar rate opportunity. We are happy to announce progress on this front. 
Late last year, we extended our long-term supply agreements with our 2 largest customers. We extended our agreement with Samsung and BOE through 2025 and 2028, respectively. This greatly increases our confidence in future yen flows. 
On the rate front, I'm sure you all noted the recent volatility in the currency market and the brief strengthening of the yen. We took advantage of this opportunity to add to our hedge position. At this point, we are hedged for approximately 70% of our anticipated yen flow from the time period of 2016 to 2022 at an average rate of $106. For those investors who are concerned about our yen exposure beyond 2017, this action will greatly mitigate those concerns. Because our capital allocation framework factored in weak yen scenarios, the additional hedges give us -- give upside to our expected operating cash flow in our 4-year plan. So while the yen will always be an important topic, we significantly reduced the downside risk and increased the certainty in our ability to return greater than $10 billion to shareholders over the next 4 years.
Now let's get into fourth quarter financials. For the quarter, we met, and in few places, exceeded our expectations and we also beat consensus. As a reminder, these are core results. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion and higher than consensus. This was down 5% versus last year's strong fourth quarter. Corporate gross margin was 42%, as expected. This is consistent with Q3, but lower than last year. Most of our businesses have a relatively high fixed cost structure, therefore the decreased sales lower our gross margin as a percentage of sales versus last year. 
S&A and RD&E were down versus last year in absolute dollars. S&A was a bit higher than we expected due to external fees associated with our external transactions. These expenses are onetime in nature and we do not expect them to repeat. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected. Congress passed the extenders bill in December and this reduced our tax expense by approximately $20 million. 
Net income was $429 million and lower than last year. The lower earnings reflect the lower volumes, mainly in Display, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, last year, we received payment regarding an IP dispute that did not repeat. 
The EPS was $0.34 and exceeded consensus. 
For the full year, our sales and earnings reflected the macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the year. 
Now let's look at detailed segment results beginning with Display Technologies. Display performance in Q4 was in line with our guidance: volume was down slightly, price declines were moderate as expected and the lower sequential decline in 2015. Display sales were $903 million and net income was $234 million. As a reminder, in Q4 last year, we received the payment regarding an IP dispute that did not repeat. As anticipated, in the fourth quarter, panel makers again lowered utilizations in response to the softer end market I already mentioned, which resulted in volume down low single digits for the glass market. Our volume was down slightly sequentially, a bit better than market declines due to the favorable resolution of a customer dispute leading to recovery of the missed volume at that customer. Sequentially, fourth quarter price declines were moderate as expected and declined less than in Q3. During the quarter, we secured the majority of our 2016 volume under customer agreements, helping us maintain stable share, which in turn enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing costs. 
Display sales were down 8% for the full year and net income was down 14%. The reduction in net income is the result of a slower growth of the LCD glass market at retail in 2015 that I already spoke to. 
We had many accomplishments in Display in 2015. I already talked about the favorable pricing. We extended long-term supply agreements with 2 major customers that go to the middle of the next decade. The integration of CPM continues to go well. And we exceeded our synergy target. And finally, we reduced costs by more than 10% and we continue to maintain our significant cost leadership.
Now moving to Optical Communications, which performed better than our guidance. Q4 sales were $736 million and up 9% versus last year, driven by acquisitions and growth in fiber-to-the-home. This was better than expected driven by stronger carrier network sales. Net income was $47 million in Q4. Net income was down 2% versus last year, which is not what you would expect with sales growth. This is mostly about mix. We had less of our sales in our higher-margin data center integrated solutions and more of our sales in lower-margin products like cable from our newly acquired Korean operation. We also experienced higher costs in our fiber business. We are addressing the cost issue and we expect overall profitability to improve in 2016. 
For the full year, we are very pleased with Optical Communications performance, which well exceeded our goal of growing more than 2x the telecom industry CapEx rate. Sales were up 12% to $3 billion, driven by growth in nearly all parts of our business. Sales would have been up 16% without the impact of FX. Net income was up 28% and significantly more than sales growth. The improved profitability was driven by the additional volume in fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions and strong manufacturing performance.
In Environmental, Q4 performance was also better than expectations. Q4 sales were $254 million, up 2% versus last year. Without the impact of FX, sales would have been up 5%. During the quarter, China implemented a stimulus program for car sales and that drove demand for our light-duty products higher than expected. Soft demand in China for heavy-duty products continued. The year-over-year profitability was down, as expected and similar to Q3. It was driven mostly by the weaker euro and lower volume in the heavy-duty China market. 
For the full year, sales were down 4% and net income was down 12%. Sales would have been up 2% without the impact of FX and profitability would have been consistent with record 2014 performance. 
In 2015, we expected growth in the global auto market and we expected another year of growth in North America and China heavy-duty truck production. We invested capacity to support this growth. We grew as expected in all markets except for China where heavy-duty truck builds were down 30% and China's auto growth, while stronger in Q4, was less than expected for the full year. 
As we start 2016, we see continued strength in the auto market, but are being impacted in our heavy-duty segment in China and now in North America, which is coming off a 2-year peak. As a result, we are carrying costs associated with capacity that is currently underutilized, but is ready and will deliver expanding market -- margins when market volumes resume. We have taken action on costs, which continues through the first half, and we expect gross margin percentages to improve year-over-year beginning in the second half of 2016.
Moving on to Specialty Materials, which performed in line with guidance. Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q4 '14, as we expected. This reflected the reduction in supply chain builds compared to a very strong build in Q4 '14. Sales were $275 million and net income was $44 million. Segment net income was up 40% in Q4, mainly due to improved gross margins in Gorilla versus last year aided by Gorilla Glass 4 prices, improved costs and the nonrepeat of a onetime unfavorable item last year. 
For the full year, Specialty Materials sales were down 8%, driven by lower sales of Advanced Optics. Sales in Advanced Optics were down related to the completion of a large aerospace and defense program, softer demand in the semiconductor industry and the weaker euro. Net income, on the other hand, was up 11%, driven by Gorilla Glass volume growth, adoption of Gorilla Glass 4 and cost reductions. 
We are pleased with our Gorilla Glass business. The market demand for cover glass was up approximately 10% in 2015 and we gained share with the big China OEMs and on touch notebooks. Additionally, the successful introduction and adoption of higher-priced Gorilla Glass 4 had a very favorable impact on our profitability.
In Life Sciences, Q4 sales were $202 million. Both sales and net income were down year-over-year driven by foreign exchange. 
For the full year, sales were down 5% and net income was down 12%, but both would have been up excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Q4 gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $78 million as expected. Hemlock contributed $39 million of the total, up from Q3, driven by customers fulfilling their annual contracts. 
For the full year, Dow Corning's equity earnings were $245 million.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $628 million and over $1 billion of adjusted operating cash flow. 
For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and spent $1.25 billion on CapEx and had free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As Wendell indicated, more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow for the full year really gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our capital allocation plan.
During the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. This reflects our accelerated stock repurchase program. 
For the full year, we spent $3.2 billion on new purchases and lowered outstanding shares by 151 million shares. We ended the year with $4.6 billion of cash with approximately $1 billion in the U.S.
Now for the outlook. We expect the global economic headwinds to persist in the first quarter and to impact our business -- or all of our businesses, year-over-year. We expect the first quarter to be the weakest in 2016 and we anticipate growth will recover in subsequent quarters. 
Let's begin by looking at each of our businesses. This morning, I will provide our Q1 expectations with some additional color on the full year. You can expect to hear more about our business outlooks at our upcoming IR day. 
Beginning with Display. To repeat what I said earlier in the call, in Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid- to high single digits driven by lower panel maker utilizations that I already mentioned. Once the supply chain returns to normal, we expect panel maker utilizations and our glass volumes to grow. We expect this growth to start in Q2. We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially. Given how our contracts work, we are confident that the price declines will be moderate in the quarter. 
As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for 2 primary reasons: first, the financial situation of our competitors indicate that they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable; and second, as we said before, we believe the glass supply and demand will remain balanced throughout the recent weakening in panel demand. We are keeping capacity off-line to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that our quarter-over-quarter price comparisons will be better for us going forward than they have been overall in the past. 
So to summarize Display. We expect our volume in Q1 to reflect the weaker retail market and lower panel market utilizations and we will manage supply to demand. We do not believe that the current economic environment reflects any fundamental change to our longer-term drivers of TV demand and that the end market will recover in 2016.
Moving to Optical Communications. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up low to mid-single digits versus last year. For the full year, we expect our sales to be at mid-single digits and exceed our goal of at least 2x the overall industry CapEx growth rates. 
Turning to Environmental. The U.S. heavy-duty truck market is forecasted to be down about 20% in 2016 after a 2-year peak, and we also expect China's heavy-duty market to remain weak. This will impact our heavy-duty volume and segment sales in Q1. We expect sales to be down approximately 10% versus last year. We do expect auto production to increase this year, but we do not expect it to offset the lower heavy-duty demand and continued FX drag. So our outlook for the full year is for Environmental sales to be down slightly from 2015. 
In Specialty Materials, we expect Gorilla Glass volume to grow in the high single digits this year. However, in Q1, segment sales are expected to decline mid-teens year-over-year and primarily through the absence of a ramp for new product launches by mobile device manufacturers like we had in Q1 of '15. For the full year, we anticipate double-digit sales and net income growth in Specialty Materials driven by Gorilla Glass. 
In Life Sciences, we expect Q1 sales to be up low single digits versus last year with underlying growth offset by the weaker euro. For the full year, we expect to grow sales faster than the market, which is expected to be up low single digits. 
Continuing with the rest of our Q1 forecast. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. This is a 1-point decline sequentially due to the expected lower Display and lower Gorilla Glass volume. We expect gross margin to improve with volumes in our businesses starting in the second quarter. 
SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. 
We expect other income/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $50 million. 
We expect Q1 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $45 million. This is down from Q4 were polysilicon customers met annual contract obligations. For the full year, we expect slight growth in both silicones and polysilicon sales. 
We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 16% to 17% range. 
That concludes our outlook for the first quarter. Now I will hand the call back to Wendell to summarize before we go to Q&A."

The question for you is it's no surprise that China consumer demand is starting to weaken especially in terms of sentiment with all the drama we are seeing in the China market there.

I think that there's -- I think the important thing to keep in mind when we look at our growth on sales on a year-over-year basis at glass at retail, what really drives a lot of that growth, of course, is what happens with the screen size. And as you saw on the chart that we presented, that's the biggest single driver of our growth on a year-over-year basis. We think sales are going to be up 2% TV unit sales on a year-over-year basis. It could be a little bit weaker than that. But we think our range of being up in the high single digits, we feel pretty good about that and a lot of that actually has to do with the screen size growth."

We see a lot of other indicators that the U.S. is weakening. So just curious to hear what your views of macro through the year are that inform that full year guidance. Second question I wanted to ask, Tony, was on the hedging. Can you talk about the fade of the hedging? So you said 70% coverage. I assume that's higher in the early years and then fades through that period. But can you give us a little bit more color on that? And then, finally, Optical was very strong.

I mean, the one area that we do think will be down on a year-over-year basis is the one that you mentioned, which is in heavy-duty trucks in North America. We expect to see continued weakness in heavy-duty trucks in China and that's why Environmental, in total, we think will be down kind of in the low single digits. From a yen standpoint, actually we're covered really throughout that -- we're covered very significantly in '16 and '17. And then as we go out after that, we're covered at a lower percentage on that. So you are correct on that. And then, Wendell, you want to talk about what's happening in Optical? I mean, it's mostly in North America?"

On the macro front, bottom line is we're planning a not-that-exciting an economy in this coming year. Where you see us recovering as the year goes on mainly has to do with the supply chain correction in Display and some pickup in some very specific areas where we have very high-margin product sets like in Gorilla and some particular market segments in Opto that have less to do with the economy and more to do, which is the cycle of product introductions or where they are in their build cycles. But in general, we're with you. We don't see that much good news in the economy here in the near term. On the yen, though, yes, it fades. What Tony and his team have managed to do here is the coverage is still quite high all the way out for a lot of years. So in many ways, this has just lopped off the downside risk of the yen. And the compliment I would make to him and his team is once we got in place the long-term supply agreements that gave us confidence we were going to have the yen flows, then we just bided our time and we're disciplined waiting for what we knew to be a bottled [ph] moment in the market, the yen would strengthen and then we had in place all the traits that would make it close at a rate that we think is attractive and gives our shareholders a good shot. So in Opto, actually though Opto is really strong throughout the year, we think it can get stronger because we had 2 areas that are sort of in a low cycle, in quarter 4 and somewhat in quarter 1, which is sort of the ultra data center market, and we're sort of in between big builds in fiber-to-the-home, right? We're sort of ramping up in Australia, we've got new ones onboard that are going to be coming onstream. So right now, Opto continues to feel strong mainly because of how superior our product set is and the extent that we're really beating the competition in all of our core sort of high-value add systems."

We're hitting on really 3 things that are in the value prop. The first is lightweight. Now despite the low gas prices, all of the car companies have, sort of by regs, have a target for what they have to increase miles per gallon",465,"So great question, Joseph. We're hitting on really 3 things that are in the value prop. The first is lightweight. Now despite the low gas prices, all of the car companies have, sort of by regs, have a target for what they have to increase miles per gallon for their fleet. So they are all very interested in lightweight-ing the vehicle. They have specific numbers in mind that they pay for every pound or kilo that they save. And with us being able to serve greater than 30% of -- reduce weight by greater than 30% at glazing at a price point that looks attractive in terms of those weight buys, that gets traction. But what we're also able to do is actually increase the safety of the vehicle because even though we're going lighter weight, basically what happens is when you have something like a rock strike, it can penetrate the outer layer of the soda lime glass, but then it doesn't penetrate Gorilla. As well to that safety component is what we've been able to show is dramatically reduce windshield replacements, is that with something like a sharp rock strike, basically we could save almost half of windshield replacement because, once again, the glass reacts in a much stronger, tougher way so you don't end up with those classic cracks that can happen from thermal shock after you had damage introduced to the glass from something sharp or blunt for that matter. And then, finally, it's the enhanced experience for the driver because here you're looking at a purely optical piece of glass, right? We make this on the same asset sets with which we make display, right? So this piece of glass, and because it's thinner, allows you to have bug displays that are 70% or more better and tremendously clearer. I mean, one of the things tested out of Consumer Electronics Show, and you'll get a chance to see it at our IR day, is take a look at sort of a HUD that we built in conjunction with Conti's, one of the -- who is the biggest HUD manufacturer in the world. And what they said was that we had never seen a HUD display like this. It's incredible, far and away. So it's all those 3 things: are we getting pull? Without a doubt. People are really excited about it. Now to calm us all down, damn, this industry moves slow, okay? So it just is a very conservative industry for good reason, right? So man, it's going to take time for us to build, which is why we keep pointing to this proof points along the way. We'll know where we are long before the volume shows up. So that's probably more than you wanted to know, Joseph."

We expect them to come back online. We're going to look to expand our presence there, right? So that's one way we do it. And then the other is more like you say, we've got to wait for the right cycles and builds on fiber-to-the-home and how that works.

Typically, the panel makers have gotten a level not typically. But the panel makers have gotten a lot sharper. With panel prices falling and they start to approach sort of their cash cost, they have been not keeping an inventory and they have been rapidly adjusting their utilization and we saw that from most of the highly established developed panel makers. We saw less of a reaction out of the major Chinese panel makers, some of whom are our really big customers, who continue to run their panel fabs probably longer than they should have. We've seen a buildup of some very small-sized TVs in that set. However, we're seeing them adjust now. But that's a very clever question.

As we reported in this morning's press release, we met, and in a few places, exceeded our expectations in quarter 4 and also beat consensus. With that said, year-over-year results in most of our businesses were impacted by the weak global economy, the stronger dollar versus other currencies and continued softness in the TV and IT for retail markets. We expect the headwinds to continue in quarter 1. 
Despite the macroeconomic challenges we faced in quarter 4, we had several major successes executing against the strategy and capital allocation framework that we introduced in October. The framework, which described our leadership priorities for the next 4 years, is simple: we will focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, create significant value and return cash to our shareholders. As we told you in October, over the course of the next 4 years, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more than $10 billion to our shareholders, which is, by the way, roughly half of our current market cap. And we will invest $10 billion in our growth and to sustain our industry leadership. We are confident this new framework will drive the company forward and guide our value creation in 2016 and beyond.
So let me just take a few minutes to highlight our recent successes under this framework. We generated more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow in 2015 despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. This is good evidence of our ability to generate the cash flow that underpins our capital allocation plan. 
We're off to a good start on our commitment to return more than $10 billion to our shareholders with a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program that we completed last week. 
We continue to focus our portfolio with the recent announcement of the strategic realignment of our interest in Dow Corning Corporation. As we indicated when we announced the transaction, we're very proud of Dow Corning's success over the last 72 years. However, Dow Corning's silicones business lies outside our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. Given Dow's strong synergies with the silicones business, we believe the transaction unlocks the value of Dow Corning for our shareholders. 
When we close this transaction, Corning will exchange its 50% interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed Dow Corning entity that will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Corning. The new entity will own approximately 40% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor and approximately $4.8 billion of cash. We believe that our ownership interest in Hemlock and additional $4.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet creates significant value. $4.8 billion is approximately a 30x multiple on the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business and it's important to remember that we expect the realignment to be essentially tax-free. This additional cash increases the amount of funds available for deployment from the $22 billion to $26 billion we discussed in October to $26 billion to $30 billion to 2019. We will provide more details on how we intend to deploy this cash when we close the transaction.
In support of our commitment to utilize our market access platforms and financial strength to grow, we leveraged our competitive advantages and strengthened customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns. First, we established a long-term supply agreement and a low-cash investment in a Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility adjacent to BOE. By utilizing others' fundings, we significantly derisked this transaction to, we expect, outstanding returns. The investment total is $1.3 billion. Our cash investment, however, is 1/4 of that, at $290 million, and at that level, exceeds our target of obtaining $2 of every $3 from others when we invest in new melting capacity. 
And second, we obtained favorable pricing for LCD glass until quarter 4. It's no secret to any of you that the display industry is experiencing significant challenges. The retail market for TV and IT softened in the back half of 2015, and supply chain weeks of inventory grew. Despite these market dynamics, our fourth quarter sequential price declines were the lowest of the year.
Stepping back and looking at 2015 as a whole, the display industry had its most challenging year in the last 5 years on a number of dimensions: first, it was the lowest end market growth in area terms over the last 5 years; second, panel price declines were the highest they have been in 5 years; and finally, the year ended with the highest level of inventory in the supply chain over the past 5 years. Now even in this environment, we had the smallest annual price decline for glass in 5 years. This is important evidence that we're making significant progress on stabilizing our returns in Display, and as you will hear in a moment from Tony, that trend continues in quarter 1 of this year. 
And finally, evidence continues to build that we will successfully leverage our automotive market access platform to disrupt the 6-billion square foot auto glazing market to drive growth for Corning. We made 2 significant announcements: first, in December, we announced that Ford will use Corning Gorilla Glass in the iconic Ford GT. This is the first production vehicle to use Gorilla Glass for multiple glazing applications including the windshield, rear engine cover and acoustic separator. It's a great example of leveraging our market access with the world's leading automakers to pursue disruptive opportunities while utilizing our existing fusion assets. This collaboration demonstrates what Corning does best: applying expertise in glass and material science to help industry leaders solve tough challenges, unleash new capabilities and enhance experiences for their customers.
Second, just last week, we announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Gobain is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to this JV and other glazers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer. This provides a low-cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions across the globe. 
So to summarize. We're making solid progress delivering on our new framework. We are generating strong and sustainable operating cash, unlocking significant value for shareholders and focusing our portfolio by removing assets outside our core capabilities; leveraging our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms to deliver strong financial performance; and we're returning cash to shareholders. Though we will clearly face economic headwinds in the first half of 2016, our confidence continues to build in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony who will review our fourth quarter results and first quarter outlook."

Before I get into the details, there are 2 hot topics with investors where I want to provide an update: LCD pricing and yen hedging after 2017. 
Starting with the LCD glass pricing, I'll spend a few minutes giving you our perspective on the display industry dynamics and explain why we are increasingly confident that our strategy to stabilize returns will work.
Let's start with the end market. To recap 2015, it was a challenging year for the industry driven by the fall-off in demand at retail. TV unit demand was actually down in several regions. Specifically, TV demand in Europe and Latin America was weaker due to the effect of the stronger dollar on retail prices and continued economic uncertainty. Taken as a whole, worldwide TV unit sell-through was down low single digits. On an area basis, the unit decline was more than offset by an average screen size growth of more than 1 inch. In addition, IT and mobile demand was weak, driven by lack of replacement drivers, the strong dollar and continued economic uncertainty. We estimate the worldwide IT market was down 6% in area in 2015. In total, the glass market at retail was up about 3% in 2015 as measured in area. 
As a result of the lower end market demand, supply chain inventory grew. Panel price declines began to accelerate and panel makers began lower utilizations in Q3 and lowered them again in Q4. Panel prices fell 30% to 40% for the year with most sizes approaching cash cost. While inventories decreased in Q4, they are still at a high level.
All of that said, coming into 2016, we expect end market demand to recover in units and for average TV screen size to continue to grow. Specifically, we expect sell-through units to be up low single digits and for average screen size to grow at least 1.5 inches. We think demand for IT in units will be consistent with 2015 and screen sizes will grow slightly. As you can see on the slide, the biggest contributor to glass area growth is screen size. TV screen size grow annually driven by affordability. As TV prices decline, consumers can buy a bigger TV for the same price. For example, today, you can purchase a 50-inch TV for the same price as a 42-inch TV in 2013. 
Now for TV units. TV units were down low single digits last year. History tells us that when you have a year with compressed TV consumption, you typically get a rebound the following year. Other drivers supporting growth in 2016 are: lower panel prices will have a positive effect on TV retail prices and will therefore increase demand, the U.S. dollar appreciation is less likely to continue and we expect an improved economy in Western Europe. As a result, we expect worldwide TV unit sell-through to be up about 2%. So for the full year, we expect demand for LCD glass at retail to grow in the high single digits. We will share more details on our market outlook for LCD in the February -- in February at our investor meeting. 
Now let's turn to the display supply chain and look how the end market, in terms of glass sell-through, interacts with glass demand. On this chart, the green line is end market demand and the blue line is glass market demand. When the green line is below the blue, panel makers are running at higher utilizations to build inventory to support an upcoming retail season. When it's below, inventory is being depleted by pull-through at retail. You can see in the time frame of Q1 to Q3 of '15 the glass market was flat because panel makers were maintaining utilizations in anticipation of the retail season and it resulted in a significant inventory build. 
Beginning in the third quarter of '15 through Q1 of '16, glass market demand is lower as panel maker utilization -- as panel makers' lower utilizations in reaction to falling panel prices and a weaker end market. Panel maker utilizations and the glass market are expected to be down sequentially in Q1, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. The combination of a healthier supply chain and end market growth will lead to panel maker utilizations increasing and our glass volume growing as the year progresses. We expect this to start in the second quarter. 
Now to sum up the year for glass demand. In Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid- to high single digits. The good news is that lower panel maker utilizations will help drive down inventory. We expect glass demand to resume strongly in the second half and we expect glass demand for the full year to grow in the mid-single digits. 
Now let's turn to the bright spot, glass pricing. Pricing in 2015 was the best in 5 years. Q4 price declines were less than any other quarter last year, and we expect glass prices in Q1 to decline moderately sequentially. The price decline in Q1 is typically the highest quarterly decline of every year because Q1 is when annual supply agreements are finalized. Our moderate Q1 price decline this year equals the best Q1 decline we've seen in 5 years despite this very tough environment. We think our display strategy passed a significant test and that Q1 pricing is a strong indicator that we can maintain favorable pricing going forward and deliver on stabilizing returns.
Now moving to the yen. As a quick refresher, we sell our display glass in yen. We have hedged till 2017 at an average rate of $99. With the stability our hedging program gives to our Display cash flows, investors naturally ask, ""What happens in 2018 and beyond?"" Our response is that we'll consider extending our hedge position as we gain certainty on our future yen flows and when the currency market offers an attractive yen-dollar rate opportunity. We are happy to announce progress on this front. 
Late last year, we extended our long-term supply agreements with our 2 largest customers. We extended our agreement with Samsung and BOE through 2025 and 2028, respectively. This greatly increases our confidence in future yen flows. 
On the rate front, I'm sure you all noted the recent volatility in the currency market and the brief strengthening of the yen. We took advantage of this opportunity to add to our hedge position. At this point, we are hedged for approximately 70% of our anticipated yen flow from the time period of 2016 to 2022 at an average rate of $106. For those investors who are concerned about our yen exposure beyond 2017, this action will greatly mitigate those concerns. Because our capital allocation framework factored in weak yen scenarios, the additional hedges give us -- give upside to our expected operating cash flow in our 4-year plan. So while the yen will always be an important topic, we significantly reduced the downside risk and increased the certainty in our ability to return greater than $10 billion to shareholders over the next 4 years.
Now let's get into fourth quarter financials. For the quarter, we met, and in few places, exceeded our expectations and we also beat consensus. As a reminder, these are core results. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion and higher than consensus. This was down 5% versus last year's strong fourth quarter. Corporate gross margin was 42%, as expected. This is consistent with Q3, but lower than last year. Most of our businesses have a relatively high fixed cost structure, therefore the decreased sales lower our gross margin as a percentage of sales versus last year. 
S&A and RD&E were down versus last year in absolute dollars. S&A was a bit higher than we expected due to external fees associated with our external transactions. These expenses are onetime in nature and we do not expect them to repeat. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected. Congress passed the extenders bill in December and this reduced our tax expense by approximately $20 million. 
Net income was $429 million and lower than last year. The lower earnings reflect the lower volumes, mainly in Display, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, last year, we received payment regarding an IP dispute that did not repeat. 
The EPS was $0.34 and exceeded consensus. 
For the full year, our sales and earnings reflected the macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the year. 
Now let's look at detailed segment results beginning with Display Technologies. Display performance in Q4 was in line with our guidance: volume was down slightly, price declines were moderate as expected and the lowest sequential decline in 2015. Display sales were $903 million and net income was $234 million. As a reminder, in Q4 last year, we received the payment regarding an IP dispute that did not repeat. 
As anticipated, in the fourth quarter, panel makers again lowered utilizations in response to the softer end market I already mentioned, which resulted in volume down low single digits for the glass market. Our volume was down slightly sequentially, a bit better than market declines due to the favorable resolution of a customer dispute leading to recovery of the missed volume at that customer. Sequentially, fourth quarter price declines were moderate as expected and declined less than in Q3. During the quarter, we secured the majority of our 2016 volume under customer agreements, helping us maintain stable share, which, in turn, enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing costs. 
Display sales were down 8% for the full year and net income was down 14%. The reduction in net income is the result of a slower growth of the LCD glass market at retail in 2015 that I already spoke to. 
We had many accomplishments in Display in 2015. I already talked about the favorable pricing. We extended long-term supply agreements with 2 major customers that go to the middle of the next decade. The integration of CPM continues to go well and we exceeded our synergy target. And finally, we reduced costs by more than 10% and we continue to maintain our significant cost leadership.
Now moving to Optical Communications, which performed better than our guidance. Q4 sales were $736 million and up 9% versus last year, driven by acquisitions and growth in fiber-to-the-home. This was better than expected driven by stronger carrier network sales. Net income was $47 million in Q4. Net income was down 2% versus last year, which is not what you would expect with sales growth. This is mostly about mix. We had less of our sales in our higher-margin data center integrated solutions and more of our sales in lower-margin products like cable from our newly acquired Korean operation. We also experienced higher costs in our fiber business. We are addressing the cost issue and we expect overall profitability to improve in 2016. 
For the full year, we are very pleased with Optical Communications performance, which well exceeded our goal of growing more than 2x the telecom industry CapEx rate. Sales were up 12% to $3 billion, driven by growth in nearly all parts of our business. Sales would have been up 16% without the impact of FX. Net income was up 28% and significantly more than sales growth. The improved profitability was driven by the additional volume in fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions and strong manufacturing performance.
In Environmental, Q4 performance was also better than expectations. Q4 sales were $254 million, up 2% versus last year. Without the impact of FX, sales would have been up 5%. During the quarter, China implemented a stimulus program for car sales and that drove demand for our light-duty products higher than expected. Soft demand in China for heavy-duty products continued. Year-over-year profitability was down, as expected and similar to Q3. It was driven mostly by the weaker euro and lower volume in the heavy-duty China market. 
For the full year, sales were down 4% and net income was down 12%. Sales would have been up 2% without the impact of FX and profitability would have been consistent with record 2014 performance. 
In 2015, we expected growth in the global auto market and we expected another year of growth in North America and China heavy-duty truck production. We invested capacity to support this growth. We grew as expected in all markets except for China where heavy-duty truck builds were down 30% and China's auto growth, while stronger in Q4, was less than expected for the full year. 
As we start 2016, we see continued strength in the auto market, but are being impacted in our heavy-duty segment in China and now in North America, which is coming off a 2-year peak. As a result, we are carrying costs associated with capacity that is currently underutilized, but is ready and will deliver expanding market -- margins when market volumes resume. We have taken action on costs, which continues through the first half, and we expect gross margin percentages to improve year-over-year beginning in the second half of 2016.
Moving on to Specialty Materials, which performed in line with guidance. Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q4 '14, as we expected. This reflected the reduction in supply chain builds compared to a very strong build in Q4 '14. Sales were $275 million and net income was $44 million. Segment net income was up 40% in Q4, mainly due to improved gross margins in Gorilla versus last year aided by Gorilla Glass 4 prices, improved costs and the nonrepeat of a onetime unfavorable item last year. 
For the full year, Specialty Materials sales were down 8%, driven by lower sales of Advanced Optics. Sales in Advanced Optics were down related to the completion of a large aerospace and defense program, softer demand in the semiconductor industry and the weaker euro. Net income, on the other hand, was up 11%, driven by Gorilla Glass volume growth, adoption of Gorilla Glass 4 and cost reductions. 
We are pleased with our Gorilla Glass business. The market demand for cover glass was up approximately 10% in 2015 and we gained share with the big China OEMs and on touch notebooks. Additionally, the successful introduction and adoption of higher-priced Gorilla Glass 4 had a very favorable impact on our profitability.
In Life Sciences, Q4 sales were $202 million. Both sales and net income were down year-over-year driven by foreign exchange. 
For the full year, sales were down 5% and net income was down 12%, but both would have been up excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Q4 gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $78 million as expected. Hemlock contributed $39 million of the total, up from Q3, driven by customers fulfilling their annual contracts. 
For the full year, Dow Corning's equity earnings were $245 million.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $628 million and over $1 billion of adjusted operating cash flow. 
For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and spent $1.25 billion on CapEx and had free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As Wendell indicated, more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow for the full year really gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our capital allocation plan.
During the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. This reflects our accelerated stock repurchase program. 
For the full year, we spent $3.2 billion on repurchases and lowered outstanding shares by 151 million shares. We ended the year with $4.6 billion of cash with approximately $1 billion in the U.S.
Now for the outlook. We expect the global economic headwinds to persist in the first quarter and to impact our business -- all of our businesses, year-over-year. We expect the first quarter to be the weakest in 2016 and we anticipate growth will recover in subsequent quarters. 
Let's begin by looking at each of our businesses. This morning, I will provide our Q1 expectations with some additional color on the full year. You can expect to hear more about our business outlooks at our upcoming IR day. 
Beginning with Display. To repeat what I said earlier in the call, in Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid- to high single digits driven by lower panel maker utilizations that I already mentioned. Once the supply chain returns to normal, we expect panel maker utilizations and our glass volumes to grow. We expect this growth to start in Q2. We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially. Given how our contracts work, we are confident that the price declines will be moderate in the quarter. 
As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for 2 primary reasons: first, the financial situation of our competitors indicate that they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable; and second, as we said before, we believe the glass supply and demand will remain balanced throughout the recent weakening in panel demand. We are keeping capacity off-line to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that our quarter-over-quarter price comparisons will be better for us going forward than they have been overall in the past. 
So to summarize Display. We expect our volume in Q1 to reflect the weaker retail market and lower panel market utilizations and we will manage supply to demand. We do not believe that the current economic environment reflects any fundamental change to our longer-term drivers of TV demand and that the end market will recover in 2016.
Moving to Optical Communications. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up low to mid-single digits versus last year. For the full year, we expect our sales to be at mid-single digits and exceed our goal of at least 2x the overall industry CapEx growth rates. 
Turning to Environmental. The U.S. heavy-duty truck market is forecasted to be down about 20% in 2016 after a 2-year peak, and we also expect China's heavy-duty market to remain weak. This will impact our heavy-duty volume and segment sales in Q1. We expect sales to be down approximately 10% versus last year. We do expect auto production to increase this year, but we do not expect it to offset the lower heavy-duty demand and continued FX drag. So our outlook for the full year is for Environmental sales to be down slightly from 2015. 
In Specialty Materials, we expect Gorilla Glass volume to grow in the high single digits this year. However, in Q1, segment sales are expected to decline mid-teens year-over-year and primarily through the absence of a ramp for new product launches by mobile device manufacturers like we had in Q1 of '15. For the full year, we anticipate double-digit sales and net income growth in Specialty Materials driven by Gorilla Glass. 
In Life Sciences, we expect Q1 sales to be up low single digits versus last year with underlying growth offset by the weaker euro. For the full year, we expect to grow sales faster than the market, which is expected to be up low single digits. 
Continuing with the rest of our Q1 forecast. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. This is a 1-point decline sequentially due to the expected lower Display and lower Gorilla Glass volume. We expect gross margin to improve with volumes in our businesses starting in the second quarter. 
SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. 
We expect other income/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $50 million. 
We expect Q1 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $45 million. This is down from Q4 where polysilicon customers met annual contract obligations. For the full year, we expect slight growth in both silicones and polysilicon sales. 
We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 16% to 17% range. 
That concludes our outlook for the first quarter. Now I will hand the call back to Wendell to summarize before we go to Q&A."

The question for you is it's no surprise that China consumer demand is starting to weaken especially in terms of sentiment with all the drama we're seeing in the China market there.

I think that there's -- I think the important thing to keep in mind when we look at our growth on sales on a year-over-year basis at glass at retail, what really drives a lot of that growth, of course, is what happens with the screen size. And as you saw on the chart that we presented, that's the biggest single driver of our growth on a year-over-year basis. We think sales are going to be up 2% TV unit sales on a year-over-year basis. It could be a little bit weaker than that. But we think our range of being up in the high single digits, we feel pretty good about that and a lot of that actually has to do with the screen size growth."

We see a lot of other indicators that the U.S. is weakening. So just curious to hear what your views of macro through the year are that inform that full year guidance. Second question I wanted to ask, Tony, was on the hedging. Can you talk about the fade of the hedging? So you said 70% coverage. I assume that's higher in the early years and then fades through that period. But can you give us a little bit more color on that? And then, finally, Optical was very strong.

We expect to see continued weakness in heavy-duty trucks in China and that's why Environmental, in total, we think will be down kind of in the low single digits. From a yen standpoint, actually we're covered really throughout that -- we're covered very significantly in '16 and '17. And then as we go out after that, we're covered at a lower percentage on that. So you are correct on that. And then, Wendell, you want to talk about what's happening in Optical? I mean, it's mostly in North America."

On the macro front, bottom line is we're planning a not-that-exciting an economy in this coming year. Where you see us recovering as the year goes on mainly has to do with the supply chain correction in Display and some pickup in some very specific areas where we have very high-margin product sets like in Gorilla and some particular market segments in Opto that have less to do with the economy and more to do, which is the cycle of product introductions or where they are in their build cycles. But in general, we're with you. We don't see that much good news in the economy here in the near term. On the yen, though, yes, it fades. What Tony and his team have managed to do here is the coverage is still quite high all the way out for a lot of years. So in many ways, this has just lopped off the downside risk of the yen. And the compliment I would make to him and his team is once we got in place the long-term supply agreements that gave us confidence we were going to have the yen flows, then we just bided our time and were disciplined waiting for what we knew to be a volatile moment in the market, the yen would strengthen and then we had in place all the traits that would make it close at a rate that we think is attractive and gives our shareholders a good shot. So in Opto, actually though Opto is really strong throughout the year, we think it can get stronger because we had 2 areas that are sort of in a low cycle, in quarter 4 and somewhat in quarter 1, which is sort of the ultra data center market, and we're sort of in between big builds in fiber-to-the-home, right? We're sort of ramping up in Australia, we've got new ones onboard that are going to be coming onstream. So right now, Opto continues to feel strong mainly because of how superior our product set is and the extent that we're really beating the competition in all of our core sort of high-value add systems."

So the first thing to get comfortable about is what do you think about total LCD glass area growth and we're sort of in line with what we see out of the sort of most trusted external sources and we have some specific thoughts on TV screen size. Then we go from that 8% to 10% to then we're going to see the supply chain decline, right, and use up some of that growth. And that sort of will take us to up single digits. So I think, Mehdi, the first thing to sort of get comfortable about is what do you think is really happening at demand and we'll try to give you some of those details so you can make a good judgment, okay?"

The key thing here isn't going to be how profitable it'll be, the key thing's going to be here is how successful can we be about sort of turning that market up on its head with our new lightweight solutions. If we can do that and get the volume, we're all going to love the profitability because we already have the capital in place really. So the first $400 million of revenue we get in that business is going to be like a free shot on goal because we'll be able to create that capacity rather than through capital spending and rather through productivity in our LCD and Gorilla businesses.

We're hitting on really 3 things that are in the value prop. The first is lightweight. Now despite the low gas prices, all of the car companies have, sort of by regs, have a target for what they have to increase miles per gallon",467,"So great question, Joseph. We're hitting on really 3 things that are in the value prop. The first is lightweight. Now despite the low gas prices, all of the car companies have, sort of by regs, have a target for what they have to increase miles per gallon for their fleet. So they are all very interested in lightweight-ing the vehicle. They have specific numbers in mind that they pay for every pound or kilo that they save. And with us being able to serve greater than 30% of -- reduce weight by greater than 30% at glazing at a price point that looks attractive in terms of those weight buys, that gets traction. But what we're also able to do is actually increase the safety of the vehicle because even though we're going lighter weight, basically what happens is when you have something like a rock strike, it can penetrate the outer layer of the soda lime glass, but then it doesn't penetrate Gorilla. As well to that safety component is what we've been able to show is dramatically reduce windshield replacements, is that with something like a sharp rock strike, basically we could save almost half of windshield replacement because, once again, the glass reacts in a much stronger, tougher way so you don't end up with those classic cracks that can happen from thermal shock after you had damage introduced to the glass from something sharp or blunt for that matter. And then, finally, it's the enhanced experience for the driver because here you're looking at a purely optical piece of glass, right? We make this on the same asset sets with which we make display, right? So this piece of glass, and because it's thinner, allows you to have bug displays that are 70% or more better and tremendously clearer. I mean, one of the things tested out of Consumer Electronics Show, and you'll get a chance to see it at our IR day, is take a look at sort of a HUD that we built in conjunction with Conti, who's one of the -- who is the biggest HUD manufacturer in the world. And what they said was that we had never seen a HUD display like this. It's incredible, far and away. So it's all those 3 things: are we getting pull? Without a doubt. People are really excited about it. Now to calm us all down, d***, this industry moves slow, okay? So it just is a very conservative industry for good reason, right? So I mean it's going to take time for us to build, which is why we keep pointing to this proof points along the way. We'll know where we are long before the volume shows up. So that's probably more than you wanted to know, Joseph."

We saw less of a reaction out of the major Chinese panel makers, some of whom are really big customers, who continue to run their panel fabs probably longer than they should have. We've seen a buildup of some very small-sized TVs in that set. However, we're seeing them adjust now. But that's a very clever question.

As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in display, environmental, specialty materials and life sciences met or exceeded expectations. Demand in Optical Communications w",959,"Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in display, environmental, specialty materials and life sciences met or exceeded expectations. 
Demand in Optical Communications was as strong as we expected, but deployment issues with new manufacturing software interrupted our cabling production and interfered with our ability to fill customer orders.
Now we are well down the path to resolving these problems, but we estimate that they reduced first quarter sales by approximately $100 million. The combination of reduced sales and spending to overcome the issues reduced first quarter net income by about $40 million.
Absent this, Optical Communications results would have been consistent with expectations. Even with this impact, however, core EPS was $0.28, consistent with consensus. 
We told you coming into the year, although we expected the first quarter to be the weakest. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the sequential growth that's beginning across our businesses.
We are also pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy and capital allocation framework. You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value.
As we shared with you on October, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more than $10 billion to our shareholders, and we will invest $10 billion to grow and to sustain our industry leadership in our focused portfolio of 3 core technologies; 4 [ph] manufacturing and engineering platforms; and 5 market access platforms.
Recent successes include cash distributions, strategic transactions, product introductions, moderating pricing environment in display and our advancement of lowest-cost manufacturing positions. 
There are few highlights in each area. We've distributed more than $2 billion to our shareholders since October. We completed a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program in January. During the remainder of the quarter, we distributed an additional $751 million through share repurchases.
In February, we announced a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend, in line with our plan to increase dividends per share by more than 10% annually.
We also initiated 3 transactions to focus our portfolio and advance our growth. In December, we announced the strategic realignment of Dow Corning. As a reminder, we plan to exchange Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for a subsidiary that will hold 40% ownership in Hemlock Semiconductor and $4.8 billion in cash.
The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business. We expect this realignment to be substantially tax-free, and will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We've made excellent progress and continue to anticipate that this transaction will close by June.
In January, we announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Gobain is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to this JV and other glaziers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a premier glass glazing company that enjoys an excellent reputation among car manufacturers.
It also provides a low cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions globally.
2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Alliance Fiber Optic Products for approximately $270 million, net of the cash plan. We expect the acquisition to be accretive during 2016 and after cost product and customer synergies. This acquisition will expand our market access and provide products that we can integrate into our solutions. 
For example, it will deepen our relationships with growing cloud data center customers, expand our access to OEM and Asian customers and enhance product sets in our fiber-to-the-home and data center portfolios. We're excited to bring a thought on point.
Turning to product introductions. Earlier this month, we announced fiber [ph] Corning Gorilla Glass, which adds value to develop and supports our strategy to double Corning's revenue for mobile device. With fiber Corning Gorilla Glass, Acer and other leading device makers, can dramatically expand their options for device design with individually customized, multicolor, high-resolution images on Corning's industry-leading cover glass solution. These features add value for consumers and increase our revenue per device.
We also continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in display to stabilize returns. You will recall from our fourth quarter conference call in January that 2015 was the display industry's most challenging year in the last 5 years. And the panel makers began reducing utilization in the back half to help return supply chain inventory to a healthy level.
We also told you that even in this difficult environment, we expected continued moderation in LCD glass pricing. And that is exactly what is playing out.
After experiencing the smallest price decline in 8 quarters during quarter 4 of 2015, our price declines in the first quarter equaled the best first quarter price decline in 5 years.
And we believe sequential price declines will further moderate in quarter 2. You can now mark 2 years of moderate, quarterly sequential price declines. 
Finally, while we enhance our lowest-cost position to several moves to consolidate our manufacturing footprint and our progress on reducing energy consumption and costs was recognized by the EPA, who named Corning an energy Star partner for the third consecutive year.
So to summarize, while we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, we are creating significant value for shareholders by utilizing our financial strength, both to enhance our focus portfolio, by investing in growth and to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Tony?"

We met expectations in display, environmental, specialty materials and life sciences in the first quarter. 
However, as Wendell said, we experienced an issue in Optical Communications due to the implementation of new manufacturing software in our cabling operations. This interrupted production has seriously impacted our ability to meet customer demand in the quarter. The estimated impact to sales was about $100 million.  The lower sales and additional cost to address these issues, reduced net income by about $40 million.  As Wendell said, absent this issue, our Optical Communications business would have met expectations. 
We have been working with customers to minimize the impact to their operations and are making steady progress towards restoring production. We are confident that we will resolve this software implementation issue during the second quarter. The financial impact in Q2 will be much smaller than Q1, and we expect to make up a good portion of the missed sales during the second half of 2016.
Now let's get into the first quarter financials. As a reminder, these are core results. 
Sales in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 11% versus last year. Without the software implementation issue in Optical Communications, we estimate the sales would have been down approximately 6%, driven by lower volume and pricing in display, but in line with expectations. 
Corporate gross margin was 41% and in line with expectations. SG&A and RD&E cost were relatively flat to Q1 of 2015 at $309 million and $109 million, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14% and lower than expected due to lower profits in Optical Communications, which incurred a tax rate above the corporate average. Net income was $340 million and lower than last year. The lower year-over-year earnings reflect the lower volume and pricing in display and also the software implementation issue in optical.
EPS was $0.28 and met expectations. Now these results are core. In Q1, our GAAP results were significantly lower than our core results, driven almost entirely by the mark-to-market accounting treatment on our currency hedge contracts. I'd like to provide a bit of context.
As most of you know, we sell LCD glass in the end, and a 1 point move in the exchange rate impacts net income and cash flow by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. We entering the currency hedge contracts, predominantly Yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals.
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offsets much of the decline in display's earnings due to the weaker Yen. We recently increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged 70% of our projected Yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per dollar.
For any investor who has been worried that the weakening Yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flows through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting.  
GAAP requires earnings translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market, and recorded at their current value.  In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter we are required to revalue all of our just-in contracts of the quarter and forward rates and record the difference in value from the prior quarter through the P&L as unrealized gain per loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earning volatility if the exchange rate changes from quarter-to-quarter. And given the size of our hedged portfolio, these adjustments can be large. 
For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we have large unrealized noncash gains after tax of $431 million and $410 million, respectively as the Yen weakened. In the first quarter this year, the Yen sharply strengthened and we had a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the Yen rate moves. And now to be clear, the amount of hedge contracts we settled in any given quarter is designed so the cash received or pay down the contract substantially offset the change in display's translated yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter.
Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparison of underlying business trends. 
Now for investors to have additional questions, Ann and Stephen are available after the call. 
Also in our GAAP earnings for the first quarter are charges of about $109 million pretax associated with reducing our cost structure, enabling us to enhance our cost leadership position. We anticipate additional charges of approximately $40 million for the remainder of the year. We estimate that the full year cash impact will be $40 million, and the annualized savings will be $50 million.
So that's our first quarter from an overall P&L perspective. Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with display technologies.
As I described in the January call, there was a significant inventory buildup in the supply chain during the back half of 2015, because the industry overestimated retail demand. We expect panel maker utilizations to decline sequentially in the first quarter in reaction to following panel prices and a weaker end market, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. We expected this to result in sequential glass demand being down mid-to high single digits.
Now despite this very tough environment, we expect that Q1 prices to decline moderately, sequentially. And that is exactly what happened. Panel makers reduced utilization and panel price declines improved to low single digits in March. Weeks of inventory ended the quarter in a healthier position. The glass market was down mid-single digits. Our volume was down mid-single digit sequentially, and price declines were moderate as expected, matching the smallest sequential first quarter decline in 5 years.
Display sales were $829 million and net income was $223 million.
Now during the quarter, we secured the remainder of our 2016 volume under customer agreement, helping us maintain stable share, which in turn enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing costs.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Q1 sales were $609 million, down 13% versus last year and below our expectations. Net income was down 54% versus last year, primarily driven by lower sales volume and additional cost associated with software implementation issues. We expect the much smaller impact to sales and profits in Q2, and to resolve these issues during the second quarter.
In environmental, Q1 sales was $264 million, down 6% versus last year, but better than the 10% decline that we expected. Stronger-than-expected demand for light duty substrates drove to beat as growth in North America and China produced record light duty substrate volume sales. Segment sales are down year-over-year due to continued weakness in the U.S. and Chinese heavy-duty truck markets as expected. Truck production in North America is down after a 2-year peak, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second year, driven by economic weakness.  As a result, year-over-year profitability was down for the segment in line with expectations. 
Now during the quarter, we also made important progress on pioneering a new mobile emission control category that is not yet reflected in our sales. 
Let me explain. Euro 6 city, starting in 2017, introduces real-world driving emission standards and requires an order of magnitude reduction in particulates generated by gasoline direct injection engines or GDI. GDI represents 23% of the global market now, and it's growing at a 17% rate.
Today, none use of filter. The 2017 let regulation will require, for the first time, a filter solution, and we are well-positioned to lead. We made progress in the first quarter by winning several new platforms designed to meet the upcoming Euro 6-C [ph] regulation. Since the filter issues, in addition to products that we already sell, Euro 6-C increases our total sales opportunity for GPF [ph] vehicles by a factor of 3 to 4.
Moving onto Specialty Materials. Performance was in line with expectations. As expected, Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q1 '15. As a reminder, comparing year-over-year Gorilla Glass growth rates in individual quarters is challenging, because the volume depends on when the supply chain is building in preparation for new product launches and the timing of OEM production ramps that varies year-to-year.
Last year, our Q1 volume is stronger, because the supply chain was building, whereas this year, we don't expect production ramps until later the year. 
Advanced optics sales were consistent with last year. In total, segment sales were $227 million, down 17%. Net income was $32 million, down 30% versus last year on the lower sales.
In life sciences, Q1 sales were $204 million and met expectations. Net income was $18 million, down $1 million versus last year.
First quarter gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $58 million and exceeded expectations of $45 million.
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash, including approximately $1.1 billion in the United States. We expect full year operating cash flow to be relatively consistent with last year. The first quarter is typically our lowest quarter of the year, and Q1 adjusted operating cash flow was approximately $110 million.  Capital spending was $270 million. 
Now for the outlook. We expect second quarter sales to grow sequentially in all of our businesses, except environmental, which will be down slightly but consistent with the second quarter of 2015.
Let's begin with display. For the full year, we continue to expect the overall, glass market, measured in square feet, to be up mid-single digits and for the retail market to be up 8% to 10%. While it's early in the year, we see some puts and takes that net out neutrally relative to our initial expectations for the year. Preliminary data indicates a TV unit growth, might be a little less than our 2% expectation, but that is offset by early evidence that diagonal screen size will increase by more than our 1.5-inch extensions. The outlook for handheld and IT is lower than our initial expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall, display glass market. Handheld and IT play a bigger role in our specialty materials segment, which I'll address in a minute.
We begin the second quarter with healthier supply chain inventory and panel makers are increasing utilizations to meet demand for the second half retail season. We expect glass market and our volume to be up high single digit sequentially in the second quarter.
We expect our LCD glass prices to -- our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially and be more moderate than Q1. We are very pleased with this more stable environment. As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for 2 primary reasons.
First, the financial situation of our competitors continues to indicate a [indiscernible] historical price declines and remain profitable. And second, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced despite occasional dips in panel demand. We are keeping capacity off-line to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Now moving to Optical Communications. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be up more than 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we expect sales to be down mid-to high single digits. 2 components of lower sales versus last year are: sales impact of $20 million to $40 million from the software implementation issues; and last year's record second quarter included some service-oriented business that doesn't repeat. For the full year, we previously guided Optical Communications sales up in the mid-single digits, but now expect sales to be up low single digits, with the change due to the software implementation issues. Demand in carrier and enterprise is as strong as we expected, and we plan to recover a portion of the missed sales from the first half of the year.
We expect sales in Optical Communications to be up more than 10% in the back half of 2016 versus last year. 
Now turning to environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect ongoing weakness in the heavy-duty truck market in North America and China to continue. We expect second quarter environmental sales to be consistent with 2015.
In specialty materials, we expect second quarter Gorilla Glass volume to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. As a result, we expect Specialty Materials sales to be up low single digits in Q2 versus 2015. For the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market outlook for 2016 has weakened, which impacts sales of Gorilla Glass. We now expect sales growth and specialty materials will be in the high or the mid to high single digits.
On the cost side, we experienced a power outage in one of our glass technologies facilities at the end of March. We quickly recovered from the incident to meet customer shipments across all product lines. We expect cost associated with recovery and repair expense to negatively impact gross margin percent in profitability and specialty materials in the second quarter.
In life sciences, we expect Q2 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite drag from the weaker Euro. Now we expect gross margin to improve sequentially in Q2. Gross margins expand with growing volume in display and higher sales in Optical Communications. The expansion would have been greater, except for the impact of the power outage. 
In total, we expect gross margins to be in the 41% to 42% range. We expect further gross margin expansion in the third quarter. 
SG&A and RD&E will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $55 million, and we expect Q2 equity earnings to be between $50 million and $70 million, depending on the closing date of the Dow Corning strategic realignment. Once we close, we will no longer recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, therefore, an earlier closing date corresponds to lower end of our estimated range. We will update you more precisely when the transaction closes.
And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 16%.  So that concludes our outlook for the second quarter. 
To summarize, in the first quarter, we've met or exceeded expectations in most of our businesses, and we expect strong sequential growth in the second quarter. We made great strides delivering on our 4-year plan to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. Ann?"

So no question, our real extending lead times there have meant we've had to apologize to our customers and do our best to get those back on track.

But there is also a hunk in cable that is just going to be lost. But you could get an alternative at the component -- cable component level. The region you feel it, the most in for us has been North America. So that's the reason it's called the worse. We felt that everywhere because once we constrain of our capacity, we sort of draw down -- North America us both worse because that's the area where we had software implementation points and telecom customers tend to qualify a specific product sets particular production facility. So that's where we felt it. It's why we're pretty encourage we can recover as well as the fact that we are -- things are really tight right now in fiber and cable. So that's our thought on that one.

So for those of you who aren't following quite as closely as Rod, the OLED capacity that has been largely announced, discussed has been for a technology called polynieated [ph OLED. Let me start with what the impact is on us and we'll give you a little background. So the impact on us is that the adoption of this OLED technology will increase Corning glass sales. Now that seems unusual, right? So probably, we should take a moment to explain it. So a little over 5 years ago, when OLED first began emerging as a number of the different OEMs started to promote them, we developed a strong point of view on how OLED would play out versus LCD. So the first step is you got to separate between large size and small. These are very different applications and they use different types of display technology today and going forward. In the large size, which is 90% of glass volume roughly, we believe strongly then and continue to believe, that OLED will be a best in this product. And we thought that because we could see how LCDs will continue to improve. And what we believe is that OLED's incremental costs would not be worth their shrinking benefits relative to LCD. And that's played out. We're gone from 3 major OEMs promoting OLED strongly, to now just 1. And certainly, the market has played out in terms of demand as we expected. We continue to expect that technological outcome for the foreseeable future. Now in small to the different matter, small about 10% of the market. We thought then and now that poly-ended OLEDs were very, very interesting. And we thought they were interesting because you could potentially conform them behind a nice piece of our Corning Gorilla Glass and get a very different customer experience where you'd have display bending around very small vessels. And long-term, the potential for a flexible display. So that's where we focused on our strategic and technical energy. And as a result, what we've done is we've developed a very advantage product and very, very, very high market shares. So as a result, even though poly-ended OLED consumes less glass, there is -- and this is way more than offset by our share gain in this technology. Plus because this is a small plus of the market, we don't see any overall impact, or overall glass supply and demand in the sort of meaningful way. OLED versus LTPS, LCD, they're going to split that market, that's not big a deal. Now as goes to timing, so we really have a good idea on timing, but we can't really discuss it because that would disclose our knowledge of our customer's exact product plans and that wouldn't be appropriate."

One is moderates price declines, and the second is volume growth. And what you saw in the first quarter, although the price declines were moderate, is our volume on a year-over-year basis was actually down. And so that that's the key driver of the reduction in profitability. In terms -- and so as you look out moving forward, as we get into quarters, where we have moderate price declines and we have significant volume increases, we certainly are going to get much closer to being have a stability in our display industry or in our display business. That's fundamentally what we have been focused on and we do believe that what's happened from a pricing standpoint over the last 2 years is as greater confidence in the ability to do that. You're second question in terms of gross margins. We would have had a greater expression of gross margin if it wasn't for the power outage in Taiwan. It will depend a little bit on actually how much that it is  costing us, if you think of it in terms of half a point from a gross margin standpoint, so that when we get into the second half of the year, when we don't have that impact, we don't have the impact from the software implementation and we have higher volumes we expect continued gross margin expansions, getting much closer to where we were in the first half of last year."

But so far, I would color it as continuing to be quite intriguing to our brands. Basically because you can get better TVs with smaller vessels and that helps you versus OLED. So all will be about how does the economics work without value prop [indiscernible] . On auto, I think you rightly noticed the amount of sort of coverage we've been getting, mainly because of one of our big brand has been promoting it so strongly so really on the back -- our customer being so excited about this, I thin we're getting all this press and the most recent one has been is what they basically have announced is sort of a joint technical study that they've done with us. That shows not only is the glass lighter weight, but that it breaks a lot less. So you have the potential for reduction in [indiscernible] by up to half. And so they got really excited about that, and they believe it's the only way to get to very thin and lightweight glazing. And the traditional ways to do it was so long, just won't work technically in this [indiscernible] . So they got really excited about that and published those [indiscernible] expect more pieces on that. That all being said, I'll say about this business what I've said from the beginning. Don't get too excited until we actually see it every day platform brand adopted. And until we get there, I don't think we've reached that tipping point. No matter how excited our customer seem to be, until I get by that point, I won't feel confident being able to predict that we really got something here. Does that make sense?"

As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences met or exceeded expectations. Demand in Optical Communications w",955,"Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences met or exceeded expectations. 
Demand in Optical Communications was as strong as we expected, but deployment issues with new manufacturing software interrupted our cabling production and interfered with our ability to fill customer orders.
Now we are well down the path to resolving these problems, but we estimate that they reduced first quarter sales by approximately $100 million. The combination of reduced sales and spending to overcome the issues reduced first quarter net income by about $40 million.
Absent this, Optical Communications results would have been consistent with expectations. Even with this impact, however, core EPS was $0.28, consistent with consensus. 
We told you coming into the year, although we expected the first quarter to be the weakest. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the sequential growth that's beginning across our businesses.
We're also pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy and capital allocation framework. You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value.
As we shared with you in October, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more than $10 billion to our shareholders, and we will invest $10 billion to grow and to sustain our industry leadership in our focused portfolio of 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms, and 5 market access platforms.
Recent successes include cash distributions, strategic transactions, product introductions, moderating pricing environment in display and our advancement of lowest-cost manufacturing positions. 
Here are a few highlights in each area. We've distributed more than $2 billion to our shareholders since October. We completed a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program in January. During the remainder of the quarter, we distributed an additional $751 million through share repurchases.
In February, we announced a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend, in line with our plan to increase dividends per share by more than 10% annually.
We also initiated 3 transactions to focus our portfolio and advance our growth. In December, we announced the strategic realignment of Dow Corning. As a reminder, we plan to exchange Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for a subsidiary that will hold 40% ownership in Hemlock Semiconductor and $4.8 billion in cash.
The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business. We expect this realignment to be substantially tax-free, and will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We've made excellent progress and continue to anticipate that this transaction will close by June.
In January, we announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Gobain is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass through this JV and other glaziers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a premier glass glazing company that enjoys an excellent reputation among car manufacturers.
It also provides a low cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions globally.
2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Alliance Fiber Optic Products for approximately $270 million, net of the cash required. We expect the acquisition to be accretive during 2016 and after cost, product and customer synergies. This acquisition will expand our market access and provide products that we can integrate into our solutions. 
For example, it will deepen our relationships with growing cloud data center customers, expand our access to OEM and Asian customers and enhance product sets in our fiber-to-the-home and data center portfolios. We're excited to bring [indiscernible] on board.
Turning to product introductions. Earlier this month, we announced Vibrant Corning Gorilla Glass, which adds value to Gorilla and supports our strategy to double Corning's revenue for mobile device. With Vibrant Corning Gorilla Glass, Acer and other leading device makers, can dramatically expand their options for device design with individually customized, multicolor high-resolution images on Corning's industry-leading cover glass solution. These features add value for consumers and increase our revenue per device.
We also continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns. You'll recall from our fourth quarter conference call in January that 2015 was the Display industry's most challenging year in the last 5 years. And the panel makers began reducing utilization in the back half to help return supply chain inventory to a healthy level.
We also told you that even in this difficult environment, we expected continued moderation in LCD glass pricing. And that is exactly what is playing out.
After experiencing the smallest price decline in 8 quarters during quarter 4 of 2015, our price declines in the first quarter equaled the best first quarter price decline in 5 years.
And we believe sequential price declines will further moderate in quarter 2. We can now mark 2 years of a moderate quarterly sequential price declines. 
Finally, we enhanced our lowest-cost positions through several moves to consolidate our manufacturing footprint and our progress on reducing energy consumption and cost was recognized by the EPA, who named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner for the 3rd consecutive year.
So to summarize, while we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, we are creating significant value for shareholders by utilizing our financial strength, both to enhance our focus portfolio by investing in growth and to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Tony?"

We met expectations in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences in the first quarter. 
However, as Wendell said, we experienced an issue in Optical Communications due to the implementation of new manufacturing software in our cabling operations. This interrupted production and seriously impacted our ability to meet customer demand in the quarter. The estimated impact to sales was about $100 million. The lower sales and additional cost to address these issues, reduced net income by about $40 million.  As Wendell said, absent this issue, our Optical Communications business would have met expectations. 
We have been working with customers to minimize the impact to their operations and are making steady progress towards restoring production. We are confident that we will resolve the software implementation issue during the second quarter. The financial impact in Q2 will be much smaller than Q1, and we expect to make up a good portion of the missed sales during the second half of 2016.
Now let's get into the first quarter financials. As a reminder, these are core results. 
Sales in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 11% versus last year. Without the software implementation issue in Optical Communications, we estimate that sales would have been down approximately 6%, driven by lower volume and pricing in Display, but in line with expectations. 
Corporate gross margin was 41% and in line with expectations. SG&A and RD&E costs were relatively flat to Q1 of 2015 at $309 million and $109 million, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14% and lower than expected due to lower profits in Optical Communications, which incurred a tax rate above the corporate average. Net income was $340 million and lower than last year. The lower year-over-year earnings reflect the lower volume and pricing in Display and also the software implementation issue in Optical.
EPS was $0.28 and met expectations. Now these results are core. In Q1, our GAAP results were significantly lower than our core results, driven almost entirely by the mark-to-market accounting treatment on our currency hedge contracts. I'd like to provide a bit of context.
As most of you know, we sell LCD glass in the end, and a 1 point move in the exchange rate impacts net income and cash flow by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. We enter into currency hedge contracts, predominantly Yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals.
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the acception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offsets much of this decline in Display's earnings due to the weaker Yen. We recently increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged 70% of our projected Yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per $1.
For any investor who has been worried that the weakening Yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flows through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting.  
GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market, and recorded at their current value.  In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter we are required to revalue all of our just-in contracts at the quarter end forward rates and record the difference in value from the prior quarter through the P&L as unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earning volatility if the exchange rate changes from quarter-to-quarter. And given the size of our hedge portfolio, these adjustments can be large. 
For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we have large unrealized noncash gains after tax of $431 million and $410 million, respectively as the Yen weakened. In the first quarter this year, the Yen sharply strengthened and we had a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the Yen rate moves. Now to be clear, the amount of hedge contracts we settled in any given quarter is designed so the cash received or pay down the contracts substantially offset the change in Display's translated Yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter.
Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. 
Now for investors who have additional questions, Ann and Stephen are available after the call. 
Also in our GAAP earnings for the first quarter are charges of about $109 million pretax associated with reducing our cost structure, enabling us to enhance our cost leadership position. We anticipate additional charges of approximately $40 million for the remainder of the year. We estimate that the full year cash impact will be $40 million, and the annualized savings will be $50 million.
So that's our first quarter from an overall P&L perspective. Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies.
As I described in the January call, there was a significant inventory buildup in the supply chain during the back half of 2015, because the industry overestimated retail demand. We expect the panel maker utilizations to decline sequentially in the first quarter in reaction to following panel prices and a weaker end market, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. We expected this to result in sequential glass demand being down mid-to high single digits.
Now despite this very tough environment, we expect that Q1 prices to decline moderately, sequentially, and that is exactly what happened. Panel makers reduced utilization and panel price declines improved to low single digits in March. Weeks of inventory ended the quarter in a healthier position. The glass market was down mid-single digits. Our volume was down mid-single digit sequentially, and price declines were moderate as expected, matching the smallest sequential first quarter decline in 5 years.
Display sales were $829 million and net income was $223 million.
Now during the quarter, we secured the remainder of our 2016 volume under customer agreement, helping us maintain stable share, which in turn enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing cost.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Q1 sales were $609 million, down 13% versus last year and below our expectations. Net income was down 54% versus last year, primarily driven by lower sales volume and additional cost associated with software implementation issues. We expect a much smaller impact to sales and profits in Q2, and to resolve these issues during the second quarter.
In environmental, Q1 sales was $264 million, down 6% versus last year, but better than the 10% decline that we expected. Stronger than expected demand for light-duty substrates drove the beat as growth in North America and China produced record light-duty substrate volume sales. Segment sales are down year-over-year due to continued weakness in the U.S. and Chinese heavy-duty truck markets as expected. Truck production in North America is down after a 2-year peak, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second year, driven by economic weakness.  As a result, year-over-year profitability was down for the segment in line with expectations. 
Now during the quarter, we also made important progress on pioneering a new mobile emission control category that is not yet reflected in our sales. 
Let me explain. Euro 6 city, starting in 2017, introduces real-world driving emission standards and requires an order of magnitude reduction in particulates generated by gasoline direct injection engines or GDI. GDI represents 23% of the global market now, and it's growing at a 17% rate.
Today, none use a filter. The 2017 regulation will require, for the first time, a filter solution, and we are well-positioned to lead. We made progress in the first quarter by winning several new platforms designed to meet the upcoming Euro 6c regulation. Since the filter issues, in addition to products that we already sell, Euro 6c increases our total sales opportunities for GPF vehicles by a factor of 3 to 4.
Moving onto Specialty Materials. Performance was in line with expectations. As expected, Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q1 '15. As a reminder, comparing year-over-year Gorilla Glass growth rates in individual quarters is challenging, because the volume depends on when the supply chain is building in preparation for new product launches and the timing of OEM production ramps that varies year-to-year.
Last year, our Q1 volume was stronger, because the supply chain was building, whereas this year, we don't expect production ramps until later in the year. 
Advanced Optic sales were consistent with last year. In total, segment sales were $227 million, down 17%. Net income was $32 million, down 30% versus last year on the lower sales.
In Life Sciences, Q1 sales were $204 million and met expectations. Net income was $18 million, down $1 million versus last year.
First quarter gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $58 million and exceeded expectations of $45 million.
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash, including approximately $1.1 billion in the United States. We expect full year operating cash flow to be relatively consistent with last year. The first quarter is typically our lowest quarter of the year, and Q1 adjusted operating cash flow was approximately $110 million.  Capital spending was $270 million. 
Now for the outlook. We expect second quarter sales to grow sequentially in all of our businesses, except Environmental, which will be down slightly, but consistent with the second quarter of 2015.
Let's begin with Display. For the full year, we continue to expect the overall glass market, measured in square feet, to be up mid-single digits and for the retail market to be up 8% to 10%. While it's early in the year, we see some puts and takes that net-out neutrally relative to our initial expectations for the year. Preliminary data indicates a TV unit growth might be a little less than our 2% expectation, but that is offset by early evidence that diagonal screen size will increase by more than our 1.5-inch expectation. The outlook for handheld and IT is lower than our initial expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Handheld and IT play a bigger role in our Specialty Materials segment, which I'll address in a minute.
We begin the second quarter with healthier supply chain inventory and panel makers are increasing utilizations to meet demand for the second half retail season. We expect glass market and our volume to be up high single digit sequentially in the second quarter.
We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially and be more moderate than Q1. We are very pleased with this more stable environment. As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for 2 primary reasons.
First, the financial situation of our competitors continues to indicate, they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable. And second, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced despite occasional dips in panel demand. We are keeping capacity off-line to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Now moving to Optical Communications. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be up more than 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we expect sales to be down mid-to high single digits. 2 components of lower sales versus last year are: sales impact of $20 million to $40 million from the software implementation issues; and last year's record second quarter included some service-oriented business that doesn't repeat. For the full year, we previously guided Optical Communications sales up in the mid-single digits, but now expect sales to be up low single digits, with the change due to the software implementation issues. Demand in carrier and enterprise is as strong as we expected, and we plan to recover a portion of the missed sales from the first half of the year.
We expect sales in Optical Communications to be up more than 10% in the back half of 2016 versus last year. 
Now turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect ongoing weakness in the heavy-duty truck market in North America and China to continue. We expect second quarter Environmental sales to be consistent with 2015.
In Specialty Materials, we expect second quarter Gorilla Glass volume to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. As a result, we expect Specialty Materials sales to be up low single digits in Q2 versus 2015. For the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market outlook for 2016 has weakened, which impact sales of Gorilla Glass. We now expect sales growth in Specialty Materials will be in the high or the mid to high single digits.
On the cost side, we experienced the power outage in one of our glass technologies facilities at the end of March. We quickly recovered from the incident to meet customer shipments across all product lines. We expect cost associated with recovery and repair expense to negatively impact gross margin percent in profitability and Specialty Materials in the second quarter.
In Life Sciences, we expect Q2 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite drag from the weaker Euro. Now we expect gross margin to improve sequentially in Q2. Gross margins expand with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. The expansion would have been greater except for the impact of the power outage. 
In total, we expect gross margins to be in the 41% to 42% range. We expect further gross margin expansion in the third quarter. 
SG&A and RD&E will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $55 million, and we expect Q2 equity earnings to be between $50 million and $70 million, depending on the closing date of the Dow Corning strategic realignment. Once we closed, we will no longer recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, therefore, an earlier closing date corresponds the lower end of our estimated range. We will update you more precisely when the transaction closes.
And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 16%.  So that concludes our outlook for the second quarter. 
To summarize, in the first quarter, we met or exceeded expectations in most of our businesses, and we expect strong sequential growth in the second quarter. We made great strides delivering on our 4-year plan to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. Ann?"

I mean, we've had to apologize to our customers, who totally rely on us in certain segments. A good news that actually enterprise started a little slow this year, but at our big telecom network providers totally felt this. And you've got to remember, we've gained so much share over these last several years because of our advantage product sets, that we have customers that basically rely on us for 100% of their deployment. So no question, our real extending lead times there have meant we've had to apologize to our customers and do our best to get those back on track. But also, we owe our investors an apology because we missed an opportunity to beat expectations and get off to a great start to the year. So now it's further added degree of the difficulty for us to be able to climb steeply to the back half and still have everybody's expectations for our sales, but we think we can do it. So to your core question, enterprise started off slow, but we expect it to be strong, to come back, that's what we hear from all of our big customers. So like I said, that ended up being a gift, but seldom this slow market to gift, but it was for us. Second, in telecom, for the core network stuff, we expect that demand to be strong this year. Just because of where they rely on us and where they don't, we do expect to recover a significant hunk of our missed shipment set, which is going to extended backlog, but we will also lose some business too. It's hard to exactly estimate that right now, Steven, but I think it integrates everything together and the way you should think about it is we're going to be growing in quarter 3 and quarter 4 with the software issue behind us, so in double digits in Opto, despite any sort of lingering impact. So that's the way we're thinking about it. As we get through quarter 2, we'll understand the actual customer impacts in a little more finer detail, but that's sort of the rough outline. Does that make sense to you, sir?"

So a rough piece is there is -- that's why we expect to recover in the back half a significant hunk of our Opto businesses, there is some of it that you just can't get the product or the systems anywhere else. But there is also a hunk in cable that is just going to be lost, that you could get an alternative at the component, at the cable component level. The region you feel it the most in for us has been North America, right? So that's the region that's felt is the worse. So we felt it everywhere because once we get a constraint of our capacity, we sort of draw down, but North America has felt it the worse because that's the area where we had the software implementation points and telecom customers tend to qualify specific product sets in particular production facilities. So that's where we felt it. It's why we're pretty encouraged we can recover as well as the fact that we are -- things are really tight right now in fiber and cable. So that's our thought on Opto. And if I moved to OLED, does that work for you Rod?"

So for those of you who aren't following and quite as closely as Rod, the OLED capacity that has been largely announced or discussed has been for a technology called poly-emit OLED. Let me start with what the impact is on us and then give you a little background. So the impact on us is that the adoption of this P-OLED technology will increase Corning glass sales. Now that seems unusual, right? So probably, we should take a moment to explain it. So a little over 5 years ago, when OLEDs first began emerging as a number of the different OEMs started to promote them, we developed a strong point of view on how OLED would play out versus LCD. So the first step is you got to separate between large size and small. These are very different applications and they use different types of display technology today and going forward. In the large size, which is 90% of the glass volume roughly, we believed strongly then and continue to believe, that OLEDs will be at best a niche product. And we thought that because we can see how LCDs will continue to improve. And what we believe is that OLEDs incremental cost would not be worth their shrinking benefits relative to LCD. And that's played out, where we've gone from 3 major OEMs promoting OLED strongly, to now just 1. And certainly, the market has played out in terms of demand as we expected. We continue to expect that technological outcome for the foreseeable future. Now in small was a different matter, small about 10% of the market. We thought then and now that poly-emit OLEDs were very, very interesting. And we thought they were interesting because you could potentially conform them behind a nice piece of our Corning Gorilla Glass and get a very different customer experience where you'd have display bending around corners and therefore very small bezels.And long-term, the potential for a flexible display. So that's where we focused our strategic and technical energy. And as a result, what we've done is, we've developed a very advantage product and very, very, very high market shares. So as a result, even though poly-emit OLED consumes less glass, there is -- this is way more than offset by our share gain in this technology. Plus because this is a small part of the market, we don't see any overall impact on overall glass supply and demand in any sort of meaningful way. Rigid OLED versus LTPS LCD, they're going to split that market, that's not that big a deal. Now as goes to timing, so we have a really good idea on timing, but we can't really discuss it because that would disclose our knowledge of our customer's exact product plans and that wouldn't be appropriate."

In terms of -- from a -- and so as you look out moving forward, as we get into quarters, where we have moderate price declines and we have significant volume increases, we certainly are going to get much closer to being -- having stability in our display industry or in our Display business. And that's fundamentally what we have been focused on. And we do believe that what's happened from a pricing standpoint over the last 2 years gives us greater confidence in the ability to do that. On your second question in terms of gross margins. We would have had a greater expansion on gross margins if it wasn't for the power outage in Taiwan.

Iris continues to get strong engagement from the brands. And where -- and you're right to ask that in and around OLEDs because it is a way to get sort of sub 5-millimeter thick LCD technology, which is starting to put you right in the zone of OLEDs. So that is part of one of those technological innovations. So we're continuing to see good strong interest in it. Fascinatingly enough, the fastest moving set of brands in this space are in China. And what we're seeing is real up-and-coming brands use this as a way to differentiate their very large TVs. So it's way too early to call this idea a success to add a third piece of glass to a TV. I think l let's keep asking the question as we roll forward. We should know a hunk more by the end of this year, how much momentum this tech has got or not. But so far, I would color it as continuing to be quite intriguing to our brands. Basically because you can get thinner TVs with smaller bezels and that helps you versus OLED. So it will all be about how does the economics work with that value prop and more to come. On auto, I think you rightly noticed the amount of sort of coverage we've been getting, mainly because -- or one of our big brands has been promoting it so strongly so really on the back -- our customers being so excited about this, that we're getting all this press. And the most recent one has been is what they basically have announced is sort of a joint technical study that they've done with us, that shows not only is the glass lighter weight, but that it breaks a lot less. So you have the potential for a reduction in rock strength grades by up to half. And so they got really excited about that, and they believe it's the only way to get to very thin lightweight glazing. And the traditional ways to do it was [indiscernible], just won't work technically and be safe. So they got really excited about that and published those papers, expect more pieces on that. That all being said, I'll say about this business what I've said from the beginning is, don't get too excited until we actually see in every day platform brand adopted. And until we get there, I don't think we've reached a tipping point. No matter how excited our customers seem to be, until I get by that point, I won't feel confident in being able to predict that we have really got something here. Does that make sense?"

As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences met or exceeded expectations.

As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences met or exceeded expectations. 
Demand in Optical Communications was as strong as we expected, but deployment issues with new manufacturing software interrupted our cabling production and interfered with our ability to fill customer orders.
Now we are well down the path to resolving these problems, but we estimate that they reduced first quarter sales by approximately $100 million. The combination of reduced sales and spending to overcome the issues reduced first quarter net income by about $40 million.
Absent this, Optical Communications results would have been consistent with expectations. Even with this impact, however, core EPS was $0.28, consistent with consensus. 
We told you coming into the year, that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the sequential growth that's beginning across our businesses.
We're also pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy and capital allocation framework. You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value.
As we shared with you in October, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more than $10 billion to our shareholders, and we will invest $10 billion to grow and to sustain our industry leadership in our focused portfolio of 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms, and 5 market access platforms.
Recent successes include cash distributions, strategic transactions, product introductions, moderating pricing environment in display and our advancement of lowest-cost manufacturing positions. 
Here are a few highlights in each area. We've distributed more than $2 billion to our shareholders since October. We completed a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program in January. During the remainder of the quarter, we distributed an additional $751 million through share repurchases.
In February, we announced a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend, in line with our plan to increase dividends per share by more than 10% annually.
We also initiated 3 transactions to focus our portfolio and advance our growth. In December, we announced the strategic realignment of Dow Corning. As a reminder, we plan to exchange Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for a subsidiary that will hold 40% ownership in Hemlock Semiconductor and $4.8 billion in cash.
The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business. We expect this realignment to be substantially tax-free, and will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We've made excellent progress and continue to anticipate that this transaction will close by June.
In January, we announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Gobain is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to this JV and other glaziers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a premier glass glazing company that enjoys an excellent reputation among car manufacturers.
It also provides a low cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions globally.
2 weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Alliance Fiber Optic Products for approximately $270 million, net of the cash required. We expect the acquisition to be accretive during 2016 and after cost, product and customer synergies. This acquisition will expand our market access and provide products that we can integrate into our solutions. 
For example, it will deepen our relationships with growing cloud data center customers, expand our access to OEM and Asian customers and enhance product sets in our fiber-to-the-home and data center portfolios. We're excited to bring AFOP on board.
Turning to product introductions. Earlier this month, we announced Vibrant Corning Gorilla Glass, which adds value to Gorilla and supports our strategy to double Corning's revenue for mobile device. With Vibrant Corning Gorilla Glass, Acer and other leading device makers, can dramatically expand their options for device design with individually customized, multicolor high-resolution images on Corning's industry-leading cover glass solution. These features add value for consumers and increase our revenue per device.
We also continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns. You'll recall from our fourth quarter conference call in January that 2015 was the Display industry's most challenging year in the last 5 years. And the panel makers began reducing utilization in the back half to help return supply chain inventory to a healthy level.
We also told you that even in this difficult environment, we expected continued moderation in LCD glass pricing. And that is exactly what is playing out.
After experiencing the smallest price decline in 8 quarters during quarter 4 of 2015, our price declines in the first quarter equaled the best first quarter price decline in 5 years.
And we believe sequential price declines will further moderate in quarter 2. We can now mark 2 years of a moderate quarterly sequential price declines. 
Finally, we enhanced our lowest-cost positions through several moves to consolidate our manufacturing footprint and our progress on reducing energy consumption and cost was recognized by the EPA, who named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner for the 3rd consecutive year.
So to summarize, while we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, we are creating significant value for shareholders by utilizing our financial strength, both to enhance our focus portfolio by investing in growth and to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Tony?"

We met expectations in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences in the first quarter. 
However, as Wendell said, we experienced an issue in Optical Communications due to the implementation of new manufacturing software in our cabling operations. This interrupted production and seriously impacted our ability to meet customer demand in the quarter. The estimated impact to sales was about $100 million. The lower sales and additional cost to address these issues, reduced net income by about $40 million.  As Wendell said, absent this issue, our Optical Communications business would have met expectations. 
We have been working with customers to minimize the impact to their operations and are making steady progress towards restoring production. We are confident that we will resolve the software implementation issue during the second quarter. The financial impact in Q2 will be much smaller than Q1, and we expect to make up a good portion of the missed sales during the second half of 2016.
Now let's get into the first quarter financials. As a reminder, these are core results. 
Sales in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 11% versus last year. Without the software implementation issue in Optical Communications, we estimate that sales would have been down approximately 6%, driven by lower volume and pricing in Display, but in line with expectations. 
Corporate gross margin was 41% and in line with expectations. SG&A and RD&E costs were relatively flat to Q1 of 2015 at $309 million and $109 million, respectively.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14% and lower than expected due to lower profits in Optical Communications, which incur a tax rate above the corporate average. Net income was $340 million and lower than last year. The lower year-over-year earnings reflect the lower volume and pricing in Display and also the software implementation issue in Optical.
EPS was $0.28 and met expectations. Now these results are core. In Q1, our GAAP results were significantly lower than our core results, driven almost entirely by the mark-to-market accounting treatment on our currency hedge contracts. I'd like to provide a bit of context.
As most of you know, we sell LCD glass in Yen, and a 1 point move in the exchange rate impacts net income and cash flow by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. We enter into currency hedge contracts, predominantly Yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals.
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the acception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offsets much of this decline in Display's earnings due to the weaker Yen. We recently increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged 70% of our projected Yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per $1.
For any investor who has been worried that the weakening Yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flows through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting.  
GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market, and recorded at their current value.  In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the quarter end forward rates and record the difference in value from the prior quarter through the P&L as unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earning volatility if the exchange rate changes from quarter-to-quarter. And given the size of our hedge portfolio, these adjustments can be large. 
For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized noncash gains after tax of $431 million and $410 million, respectively as the Yen weakened. In the first quarter this year, the Yen sharply strengthened and we had a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the Yen rate moves. Now to be clear, the amount of hedge contracts we settled in any given quarter is designed so the cash received or pay down the contracts substantially offset the change in Display's translated Yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter.
Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. 
Now for investors who have additional questions, Ann and Stephen are available after the call. 
Also in our GAAP earnings for the first quarter are charges of about $109 million pretax associated with reducing our cost structure, enabling us to enhance our cost leadership position. We anticipate additional charges of approximately $40 million for the remainder of the year. We estimate that the full year cash impact will be $40 million, and the annualized savings will be $50 million.
So that's our first quarter from an overall P&L perspective. Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies.
As I described in the January call, there was a significant inventory buildup in the supply chain during the back half of 2015, because the industry overestimated retail demand. We expect the panel maker utilizations to decline sequentially in the first quarter in reaction to following panel prices and a weaker end market, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. We expected this to result in sequential glass demand being down mid-to high single digits.
Now despite this very tough environment, we expect that Q1 prices to decline moderately, sequentially, and that is exactly what happened. Panel makers reduced utilization and panel price declines improved to low single digits in March. Weeks of inventory ended the quarter in a healthier position. The glass market was down mid-single digits. Our volume was down mid-single digit sequentially, and price declines were moderate as expected, matching the smallest sequential first quarter decline in 5 years.
Display sales were $829 million and net income was $223 million.
Now during the quarter, we secured the remainder of our 2016 volume under customer agreement, helping us maintain stable share, which in turn enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing cost.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Q1 sales were $609 million, down 13% versus last year and below our expectations. Net income was down 54% versus last year, primarily driven by lower sales volume and additional costs associated with software implementation issues. We expect a much smaller impact to sales and profits in Q2, and to resolve these issues during the second quarter.
In environmental, Q1 sales were $264 million, down 6% versus last year, but better than the 10% decline that we expected. Stronger than expected demand for light-duty substrates drove the beat as growth in North America and China produced record light-duty substrate volume sales. Segment sales are down year-over-year due to continued weakness in the U.S. and Chinese heavy-duty truck markets as expected. Truck production in North America is down after a 2-year peak, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second year, driven by economic weakness.  As a result, year-over-year profitability was down for the segment in line with expectations. 
Now during the quarter, we also made important progress on pioneering a new mobile emission control category that is not yet reflected in our sales. 
Let me explain. Euro 6 city, starting in 2017, introduces real-world driving emission standards and requires an order of magnitude reduction in particulates generated by gasoline direct injection engines or GDI. GDI represents 23% of the global market now, and it's growing at a 17% rate.
Today, none use a filter. The 2017 regulation will require, for the first time, a filter solution, and we are well-positioned to lead. We made progress in the first quarter by winning several new platforms designed to meet the upcoming Euro 6c regulation. Since the filter issues, in addition to products that we already sell, Euro 6c increases our total sales opportunities for GPF vehicles by a factor of 3 to 4.
Moving onto Specialty Materials. Performance was in line with expectations. As expected, Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q1 '15. As a reminder, comparing year-over-year Gorilla Glass growth rates in individual quarters is challenging, because the volume depends on when the supply chain is building in preparation for new product launches and the timing of OEM production ramps that varies year-to-year.
Last year, our Q1 volume was stronger, because the supply chain was building, whereas this year, we don't expect production ramps until later in the year. 
Advanced Optic sales were consistent with last year. In total, segment sales were $227 million, down 17%. Net income was $32 million, down 30% versus last year on the lower sales.
In Life Sciences, Q1 sales were $204 million and met expectations. Net income was $18 million, down $1 million versus last year.
First quarter gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $58 million and exceeded expectations of $45 million.
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash, including approximately $1.1 billion in the United States. We expect full year operating cash flow to be relatively consistent with last year. The first quarter is typically our lowest quarter of the year, and Q1 adjusted operating cash flow was approximately $110 million.  Capital spending was $270 million. 
Now for the outlook. We expect second quarter sales to grow sequentially in all of our businesses, except Environmental, which will be down slightly, but consistent with the second quarter of 2015.
Let's begin with Display. For the full year, we continue to expect the overall glass market, measured in square feet, to be up mid-single digits and for the retail market to be up 8% to 10%. While it's early in the year, we see some puts and takes that net-out neutrally relative to our initial expectations for the year. Preliminary data indicates a TV unit growth might be a little less than our 2% expectation, but that is offset by early evidence that diagonal screen size will increase by more than our 1.5-inch expectation. The outlook for handheld and IT is lower than our initial expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Handheld and IT play a bigger role in our Specialty Materials segment, which I'll address in a minute.
We begin the second quarter with healthier supply chain inventory and panel makers are increasing utilizations to meet demand for the second half retail season. We expect glass market and our volume to be up high single digit sequentially in the second quarter.
We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially and be more moderate than Q1. We are very pleased with this more stable environment. As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for 2 primary reasons.
First, the financial situation of our competitors continues to indicate, they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable. And second, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced despite occasional dips in panel demand. We are keeping capacity off-line to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Now moving to Optical Communications. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be up more than 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we expect sales to be down mid-to high single digits. 2 components of lower sales versus last year are: sales impact of $20 million to $40 million from the software implementation issues; and last year's record second quarter included some service-oriented business that doesn't repeat. For the full year, we previously guided Optical Communications sales up in the mid-single digits, but now expect sales to be up low single digits, with the change due to the software implementation issues. Demand in carrier and enterprise is as strong as we expected, and we plan to recover a portion of the missed sales from the first half of the year.
We expect sales in Optical Communications to be up more than 10% in the back half of 2016 versus last year. 
Now turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect ongoing weakness in the heavy-duty truck market in North America and China to continue. We expect second quarter Environmental sales to be consistent with 2015.
In Specialty Materials, we expect second quarter Gorilla Glass volume to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. As a result, we expect Specialty Materials sales to be up low single digits in Q2 versus 2015. For the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market outlook for 2016 has weakened, which impact sales of Gorilla Glass. We now expect sales growth in Specialty Materials will be in the high or the mid to high single digits.
On the cost side, we experienced the power outage in one of our glass technologies facilities at the end of March. We quickly recovered from the incident to meet customer shipments across all product lines. We expect cost associated with recovery and repair expense to negatively impact gross margin percent in profitability and Specialty Materials in the second quarter.
In Life Sciences, we expect Q2 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite drag from the weaker Euro. Now we expect gross margin to improve sequentially in Q2. Gross margins expand with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. The expansion would have been greater except for the impact of the power outage. 
In total, we expect gross margins to be in the 41% to 42% range. We expect further gross margin expansion in the third quarter. 
SG&A and RD&E will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $55 million, and we expect Q2 equity earnings to be between $50 million and $70 million, depending on the closing date of the Dow Corning strategic realignment. Once we closed, we will no longer recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, therefore, an earlier closing date corresponds the lower end of our estimated range. We will update you more precisely when the transaction closes.
And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 16%.  So that concludes our outlook for the second quarter. 
To summarize, in the first quarter, we met or exceeded expectations in most of our businesses, and we expect strong sequential growth in the second quarter. We made great strides delivering on our 4-year plan to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. Ann?"

We said all along that when we do close that we would discuss more what we do, plan to do from a cash standpoint. I think it is reasonable to assume that over a period of time, as we make this transaction, that we look at offsetting the dilution from no longer having the equity earnings during -- excuse me, that we offset the dilution on the equity earnings at some point in time although we are not actually talking about a very specific timing on that. In terms of the cash availability, as we've mentioned that from a overall standpoint, there are restrictions relative to the cash availability, but that's cash that we need to control and manage internally from an investor standpoint. If we use the cash to invest in the business, I think then we're able to offset that with cash somewhere else. So for example, if we were to make an acquisition, that we could use cash from that and that would offset cash in another place. So from an overall, standpoint, that's how we're thinking about the Dow Corning transaction."

I mean, we've had to apologize to our customers, who totally rely on us in certain segments. Thank goodness that actually enterprise started a little slow this year, but at our big telecom network providers totally felt this. And you've got to remember, we've gained so much share over these last several years because of our advantage product sets, that we have customers that basically rely on us for 100% of their deployment. So no question, our real extending lead times there have meant we've had to apologize to our customers and do our best to get those back on track. But also it's, we owe our investors an apology because we missed an opportunity to beat expectations and get off to a great start to the year. So now it's further added degree of the difficulty for us to be able to climb steeply to the back half and still have everybody's expectations for our sales, but we think we can do it. So to your core question, enterprise started off slow, but we expect it to be strong, to come back, that's what we're hearing from all of our big customers. So like I said, that ended up being a gift, but seldom their slow market to gift, but it was for us. Second, in telecom, for the core network stuff, we expect that demand to be strong this year. Just because of where they rely on us and where they don't, we do expect to recover a significant hunk of our missed shipment set, that just go into extended backlog, but we will also lose some business too. It's hard to exactly estimate that right now, Steven, but I think it integrates everything together and the way you should think about it is we're going to be growing in quarter 3 and quarter 4 with the software issue behind us, sort of double digits in Opto, despite any sort of lingering impact. So that's the way we're thinking about it. As we get through quarter 2, we'll understand the actual customer impacts in a little more finer detail, but that's sort of the rough outline.

I just have to tell them so that when Tony and Ann go out to talk to investors, they would be able to have a reference point. So let's start with your Opto question.  Very observant, Rod. So a rough piece is there is -- that's why we expect to recover in the back half a significant hunk of our Opto businesses, there is some of it that you just can't get the product or the systems anywhere else. But there is also a hunk in cable that is just going to be lost, that you could get an alternative at the component, at the cable component level. The region you feel it the most in for us has been North America, right? So that's the region that's felt is the worse. So we felt it everywhere because once we get a constraint of our capacity, we sort of draw down, but North America has felt it the worse because that's the area where we had the software implementation points and telecom customers tend to qualify specific product sets in particular production facilities. So that's where we felt it. It's why we're pretty encouraged we can recover as well as the fact that we are -- things are really tight right now in fiber and cable. So that's our thought on Opto. And before I move to OLED, does that work for you Rod?"

So for those of you who aren't following and quite as closely as Rod, the OLED capacity that has been largely announced or discussed has been for a technology called poly-emit OLED. Let me start with what the impact is on us and then give you a little background. So the impact on us is that the adoption of this P-OLED technology will increase Corning glass sales. Now that seems unusual, right? So probably, we should take a moment to explain it. So a little over 5 years ago, when OLEDs first began emerging as a number of the different OEMs started to promote them, we developed a strong point of view on how OLED would play out versus LCD. So the first step is you got to separate between large size and small. These are very different applications and they use different types of display technology today and going forward. In the large size, which is 90% of the glass volume roughly, we believed strongly then and continue to believe, that OLEDs will be at best a niche product. And we thought that because we could see how LCDs will continue to improve. And what we believe is that OLEDs incremental cost would not be worth their shrinking benefits relative to LCD. And that's played out, where we've gone from 3 major OEMs promoting OLED strongly, to now just 1. And certainly, the market has played out in terms of demand as we expected. We continue to expect that technological outcome for the foreseeable future. Now in small was a different matter, small about 10% of the market. We thought then and now that poly-emit OLEDs were very, very interesting. And we thought they were interesting because you could potentially conform them behind a nice piece of our Corning Gorilla Glass and get a very different customer experience where you'd have displays bending around corners and therefore very small bezels.And long-term, the potential for a flexible display. So that's where we focused our strategic and technical energy. And as a result, what we've done is, we've developed a very advantage product and very, very, very high market shares. So as a result, even though poly-emit OLED consumes less glass, there is -- this is way more than offset by our share gain in this technology. Plus because this is a small part of the market, we don't see any overall impact on overall glass supply and demand in any sort of meaningful way. Rigid OLED versus LTPS LCD, they're going to split that market, that's not that big a deal. Now as goes to timing, so we have a really good idea on timing, but we can't really discuss it because that would disclose our knowledge of our customer's exact product plans and that wouldn't be appropriate."

In terms of -- from a -- and so as you look out moving forward, as we get into quarters, where we have moderate price declines and we have significant volume increases, we certainly are going to get much closer to being -- having stability in our display industry or in our Display business. And that's fundamentally what we have been focused on. And we do believe that what's happened from a pricing standpoint over the last 2 years gives us greater confidence in the ability to do that. On your second question in terms of gross margins. We would have had a greater expansion on gross margins if it wasn't for the power outage in Taiwan. Where it will depend a little bit on actually how much that ends up costing us, But if you think of it in terms of 0.5 a point from a gross margin standpoint, so that when we get into the second half of the year, and we don't have that impact, we don't have the impact from the software implementation and we have higher volumes we expect continued gross margin expansion, getting much closer to where we were in the first half of last year."

Iris continues to get strong engagement from the brands. And where -- and you're right to ask that in and around OLEDs because it is a way to get sort of sub 5-millimeter thick LCD technology, which is starting to put you right in the zone of OLEDs. So that is part of one of those technological innovations. So we're continuing to see good strong interest in it. Fascinatingly enough, the fastest moving set of brands in this space are in China. And what we're seeing is real up-and-coming brands use this as a way to differentiate their very large TVs. So it's way too early to call this idea a success to add a third piece of glass to a TV. I think l let's keep asking the question as we roll forward. We should know a hunk more by the end of this year, how much momentum this tech has got or not. But so far, I would color it as continuing to be quite intriguing to our brands. Basically because you can get thinner TVs with smaller bezels and that helps you versus OLED. So it will all be about how does the economics work with that value prop and more to come. On auto, I think you rightly noticed the amount of sort of coverage we've been getting, mainly because -- or one of our big brands has been promoting it so strongly so really on the back -- our customers being so excited about this, that we're getting all this press. And the most recent one has been is what they basically have announced is sort of a joint technical study that they've done with us, that shows not only is the glass lighter weight, but that it breaks a lot less. So you have the potential for a reduction in rock strength grades by up to half. And so they got really excited about that, and they believe it's the only way to get to very thin lightweight glazing. And the traditional ways to do it was [indiscernible], just won't work technically and be safe. So they got really excited about that and published those papers, expect more pieces on that. That all being said, I'll say about this business what I've said from the beginning is, don't get too excited until we actually see in every day platform brand adopted. And until we get there, I don't think we've reached a tipping point. No matter how excited our customers seem to be, until I get by that point, I won't feel confident in being able to predict that we have really got something here. Does that make sense?"

As you saw in this morning's press release, second quarter results exceeded our expectations with core EPS up 32% sequentially to $0.37. 
We told you coming into this year that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest and the momentum would build throughout the year. We still expect that to be the case.  We're very encouraged by our second quarter improvement, and we are confident that we will see both sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and EPS in the third quarter. 
Tony will discuss our results in detail, but before he does, I want to offer some color on the great progress we're making against the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework that we announced last October. 
You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. No doubt, the highlight of our second quarter progress was closing the realignment of our interest in Dow Corning. In that transaction, we exchanged Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for 100% of the subsidiary that holds equity interest in Hemlock and approximately $4.8 billion in cash. 
The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, unlocking tremendous value for our shareholders. 
Our continued ownership interest in Hemlock allows us to capture potential upside from a rebound in the solar market, while also providing market insight and access for our semiconductor innovation programs. 
Notably, the realignment was a significant milestone in delivering on our strategy to focus 80% of our resources on our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. 
We are also making steady progress on other aspects of our focused portfolio strategy. Let's take a look at a few examples. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns and deliver new innovations that increase our revenue for Display. 
In May, our Iris Glass earned a display Component of the Year Award at FID for enabling thinner displays with lower color shift. 
This technology replaces plastic plates, adding a third piece of glass to large edgeless TVs, and I'm very pleased with the additional commercial transaction that we're gaining on this product. 
In the automotive space, we are reapplying our core technologies and reusing our manufacturing assets to assist manufacturers looking toward connected cars and tighter regulations. Gorilla Glass for auto is a great example. It is 30% lighter than traditional auto glass, offers important safety advantages and provides a superior surface for heads-up displays. 
In April, we presented a joint paper at SAE Woodford that demonstrated Gorilla Glass for auto is 2 to 3x stronger in rock strikes with reduced falling hazards versus soda lime glass.  I'm very much looking forward to reporting more on this topic in the future. 
Our efforts to lead in gas-particulate filters also advanced during the quarter. I remember that if adopted, this technology increases our revenue by 3 to 4x for gasoline direct injection engines. The exciting news for us is that both Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz announced that they will equip vehicles with gas-particulate filters beginning as early as 2017, and we won several new GPF platforms in quarter 2. 
In mobile consumer electronics, we just announced a new member of the Corning Gorilla Glass family, Gorilla Glass 5. It has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We expect this superior drop performance to translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and to expand the use of Gorilla. 
Given the drop performance is the #1 want for consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We should be hearing announcements from them in the near future. 
In the growing Optical Communications market, we closed on the acquisition of Alliance Fiber Optic Products, bolstering our presence in the high-growth cloud data center market. This acquisition supports our optical market access platform by accelerating our co innovation strategy and adding new products. We see it strengthening our ability to deliver high-value optical solutions, from network operations worldwide. 
We also announced a separate investment in a small company, Versalu, to commercialize our fiber light diffusing fiber. Fibers combined Corning's strength in glass optical physics in fiber manufacturing, but its benefit extend beyond Corning's current market focus. Versalu will enable fiber's technology to quickly get into the hands of designers and customers in architecture, auto lighting, medical devices, athletic apparel, aerospace and other industries seeking to solve difficult lighting challenges. Personal demonstrates one way, that we can keep our focus on the core 3 4 5 portfolio while still extending the impact of Corning innovation to new markets. 
Those projects illustrate just some of the ways that we will invest $10 billion under the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We believe the investments will produce significant sales growth by extending our leadership in existing markets and positioning us to win in new markets. 
Let's turn to the second part of our strategy and capital allocation framework, utilizing our financial strength. We updated the framework in June to recognize significant progress across multiple fronts, including the closing of the Dow Corning transaction. We now expect to generate and deploy deploying more than $26 billion to 2019, up from our previous plan to deploy more than $22 billion. 
Notably, we are raised the lower bound of our commitment to shareholder returns to $12.5 billion through 2019, up from $10 billion. 
Cumulatively, since October, we've already returned $3 billion under the framework, including $810 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. 
Today, we are announcing our intention to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which will approximately offset the EPS impact from the loss of Dow Corning's silicones earnings. 
So to summarize, we are making solid progress in delivering on our new framework, which is designed to deliver secular growth while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders. We are utilizing our financial strength to invest in our focused portfolio and drive that growth. 
We have raised our planned cash distributions to shareholders to more than $12.5 billion, which is equivalent to about half Corning's current market capitalization. 
We look forward to launching our new $2 billion ASR tomorrow. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony who will review our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Tony?"
173840,370216162,1013212,"Corning Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for strong second half. We were particularly pleased with",2675,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for strong second half. 
We were particularly pleased with our strong operating results, including the strong sequential sales and profit growth in Optical Communications and Display's moderate price declines and strong sequential volume growth. 
In Optical Communications, cable production levels recovered during the second quarter from the first quarter software implementation issue. Combined with strong demand, the recovery resulted in sequential sales growth for Optical up 28%, which was even better than the guidance we provided in April. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the further sequential and year-over-year growth we see in the third quarter. 
Now before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I want to briefly point to the 2 primary drivers between our GAAP and core results for this quarter. 
First, our GAAP net income includes a $2.7 billion nontaxable gain on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning. 
Second, similar to the first quarter, this quarter's GAAP results were affected by a $791 million noncash mark-to-market loss that reflects the required accounting treatment for our currency hedge contracts. 
I'd like to provide a bit of context. As you know, we sell LCD glass in yen and a one point moving the exchange rate affects our net income and cash flow translation by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. As you also know, we have currency hedge contracts predominantly in yen to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increased the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals. 
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offset much of the decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
In January, we increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 1 06 per $1. For any investor who is worried that a weakening yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting. As we discussed in detail last quarter, GAAP requires earnings translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at the current value in the current quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. 
In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the current and forward rate -- [indiscernible] quarter forward rate and recorded difference in value from the prior quarter and through the P&L as an unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earnings volatility if the exchange rate changes from quarter-to-quarter. 
Given the size of our hedged portfolio, these adjustments can be large. For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized noncash gains of $431 million and $410 million, respectively, primarily due to the weakening yen. In the first quarter this year, the yen strengthened, driving a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Macroeconomic factors, including concern around Brexit caused further fluctuation in the yen exchange rates and overall, it strengthened, again, over the second quarter, which was the primary factor in the $791 million mark-to-market loss.  Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the yen rate moves. 
To be clear, this GAAP accounting has no impact on our cash flow in the quarter. Actual cash flow in any quarter is determined by the amount of hedge contracts we settle in any given quarter. Our contracts are designed so that the cash received or paid on the contracts substantially offset the change in Display's translated earnings and cash flow in that quarter. Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. 
For investors who have additional questions, there is a tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the digital media disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and the team are available after the call. 
Now let's turn to the results for the second quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up sequentially from $2.2 billion in Q1 and exceeding our expectations, driven by Optical Communications. Corporate gross margin was 43%, up more than 200 basis points sequentially and better than our guidance. The uptick reflected the added volume in Optical Communications. 
SG&A was 14% of sales at $342 million, as expected. RD&E cost were flat sequentially and versus last year at $192 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%, as guided. Net income was $434 million, up almost $100 million from Q1 and EPS was $0.37 and above expectations. 
Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. In the second quarter, the display market in our performance tracked with our observations in April. You may recall that in the first quarter, Panel Makers lowered utilization, which allowed the supply chain to reduce inventory. Glass demand was down sequentially and year-over-year. We expect that Panel Makers to increase utilization in Q2 to meet demand for the second half retail season and for glass demand to grow, and that's what we saw in industry dynamics in recent months. 
At retail, sales through May showed demand tracking into our overall expectations for glass area growth of 8% to 10% in 2016. Panel prices across most TV sizes increased and panel makers turned up utilization rates to meet demand for the second quarter. We issued inventory in the supply chain and in the quarter at a healthy level, glass supply and demand remains balanced and our share is stable. As a result of these and other factors, our volume returned to year-over-year growth and was up high single digits sequentially. Price declines were moderate as expected. 
These dynamics informed our belief that we will see year-over-year volume growth continued in the second half and that moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 8 quarters will continue or even improve, which is good for Corning. 
Second quarter sales and net income in Display were up 6% sequentially driven by the stronger volume. 
Let's move to Optical Communications. Results snapped back from the first quarter due to strong demand and the return to core production in our cabling facilities towards the end of the quarter. Q2 sales were $782 million, up 28% sequentially and better than we expected. Net income at $86 million was more than triple the first quarter. We are very pleased to be in full production and continue to work hard to meet our commitments to customers. 
In Environmental, Q2 sales were consistent with last year and in line with expectations. Sales of light-duty products for auto were up year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand. This strength was offset by the continued weakness in North America and China for heavy-duty diesel products. 
Truck production in North America is down this year and China's production is also expected to be down for the second consecutive year, driven by the weakness in their economy.  Net income was consistent with Q1 and in line with our expectations. 
Let's move to Specialty Materials. For the quarter, sales were up 17% sequentially and net income was up 50% on the higher volume. The premium on Gorilla Glass 4 drove a 9% increase in year-over-year net income. 
That said, more broadly the market for smartphones, tablets and laptop computers is lower than we expected. Lowlight macroeconomic conditions are slow in demand in emerging markets. 
Additionally, there have been fewer major product launches to drive demand and the replacement cycle appears to be longer. Our customers are responding to this lower demand environment. 
As a result, Gorilla Glass volume and Specialty Materials sales did not meet expectations in Q2. Segment sales were down 2% versus last year. 
We anticipate this weaker handheld in IP and market environment will persist through the second half and we now expect full year sales in Specialty Materials to be consistent with or down slightly from 2015, driven primarily by our performance in Q1. We do expect sequential growth in each quarter. 
Although we expect the overall market demand to be flat, we are extending our leadership in the cover glass market. First, we are gaining even more share in the alumina silicon cover glass; and second, our ability to innovate and deliver value-add products at a premium price is playing out as we expected. 
And as Wendell said, we're attacking, again, with our recent launch of Gorilla Glass 5. We look for innovations like this to drive revenue and income growth even in a maturing market. 
In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were $215 million and met our expectations for low single digit growth. Net income was $21 million, consistent with last year and higher than Q1 on higher sales. 
Now let's turn to equity earnings. As Wendell said, the close of the Dow Corning realignment in June was a significant milestone for Corning. The transaction adds $4.8 billion in cash to our balance sheet or about 30x Dow Corning's annual silicones equity earnings and was essentially tax-free. The freedom to deploy that capital is a tremendous value driver for our shareholders. 
Because of the timing of the transaction, the equity earnings line in our second quarter financial statements reflect only 2 months of Dow Corning's silicones equity earnings plus a full quarter of Hemlock's equity earnings. 
For your models, the way we will report Hemlock's equity earnings in our income statement going forward is changing. Prior to restructuring, equity earnings in Hemlock was reported in equity earnings on an after-tax basis. 
Going forward, it will be reported on a pretax basis and the taxes will be reported as part of Corning's total tax expenses. 
As you can see from this example on the slide, the contributions to our net income does not change. If you have any questions on this, of course, Ann and her team will be happy to help. 
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash growth. We ended the quarter was $7.1 billion of cash, up $3.5 billion in cash at March 31, including approximately $5 billion in the United States. 
Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was up significantly over Q1, as expected, at $595 million. The comparison to 2015 is challenging because this year, we did not receive dividends from Dow Corning in light of the realignment in June. We paid a onetime legal settlement and net income was lower. We expect operating cash flow to be up even more in the second half. Historically, most of our operating cash flow is generated in the back half of the year. Major drivers of the increase include higher net income, a reduction in working capital and a non-repeat of front half loaded cash expenses. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $810 million worth of common shares outstanding. 
Now for the outlook. Let's begin with Display and the Display market. For the full year, our view of end market and glass market growth is unchanged. While there are puts and takes by region, we continue to expect a worldwide TV unit growth of 2% and screen size to increase by more than 1.5 inches. 
As I already mentioned, the outlook for handheld and IT market is lower than our prior expectations, but those segments are relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Therefore, in total for the year, we still expect the overall retail market in square feet to be up 8% to 10%, and we continue to expect the overall glass market in terms of area to be up in the mid-single digits. Now first quarter supply chain inventory drive down accounts for the difference. 
Turning to our third quarter. We're seeing healthy supply chain inventory. Panel makers inventory is lean, and they are further increasing utilization to meet increased demands from set makers.  
As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-single-digit sequentially in the third quarter. We also expect our LCD glass prices the decline moderately sequentially consistent with Q2. As we have previously explained, we will maintain our stable share strategy and online our operating capacity with market demand, and we continue to expect a more favorable pricing environment will continue or possibly improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitored utilization and market demand and other market factors very closely and all indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year, especially in the large Gen sizes as a result of strong TV demand. 
Second, our competitors profitability is low. Even though price declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has declined during that period. Therefore. We expect that their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. 
For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward. 
Moving to Optical Communications. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 10% versus last year, driven by growth in fiber-to-the-home and data centers. 
Turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market but expect weakness in the heavy duty truck markets in North America and China to continue. We expect third quarter environmental sales to be down slightly year-over-year, driven by foreign exchange. 
In Specialty Materials, we expect sales to be consistent with Q3 last year. This is an 8% up sequentially, driven mainly by volume growth of Gorilla Glass in preparation for new product launches later this year. 
And for the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market for '16 has weakened, which impacts sales of Gorilla Glass. As a result, we now expect the sales in Specialty Materials will be consistent or down slightly from last year, but will be up sequentially each quarter. 
In Life Sciences, we expect Q3 sales to be up low single digits versus last year despite a drag from our foreign exchange. 
Turning to the consolidated outlook. We expect the gross margin to be approximately 43% and consistent with Q2. Most margins expand versus last year with growing volume in display and higher sales in Optical Communications. 
SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 7% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income other expense to be a net expense of approximately $16 million. We expect Q3 total gross equity earnings to be approximately $15 million. As a reminder, we no longer have silicones equity earnings. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 15% to 16% range. 
Now that concludes our outlook for the third quarter. Let me close by saying that we are pleased with the strong sequential growth in sales in earnings in the second quarter. We are confident that Corning's performance will continue to improve with year-over-year sales and EPS growth in both the third and fourth quarters, and we look forward to delivering on our long-term commitments to create strong value. We expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders. We are focusing our portfolio to increase our profitability of success, reduce the of cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition, and we have a rich set of growth opportunities.

And now pretty widely reported that the expectations are for the market to be pretty flattish. So now then, you'd start where do our strategies begin to impact our revenue realization in that slower-growth market as well as what will be the next sort of uptick in the market one way or the other. So let's fill the second quarter. Uptake in the market, for us, it really does get driven by how exciting a product our customers come out with and its impact on consumers. So I can't give much insight into that for you, but we do believe that we see some pretty exciting products coming that should help in the total market growth. Now let's than take a look at us a more micro way. We would normally expect that we're going to grow faster than the market and that, that is because of our superior product, we should be always in any sort of share gaining mode as well as that as we introduce higher value add products, we'll get higher revenue for device. I think this year, we have an interesting dynamic in that customer mix can really make an impact. We have some customers where we do virtually all of the corporate class needs and some, where we just do the majority. So which customer gets impacted and impact us a little more outsized when you're dealing with the slower-growth market. And then second is just been timing on adoption of some of the higher value add products and our ability to manufacture. Good example of this is Phire where we continue to get very good poll on Phire, especially for wearables. But the difficulty that manufacturing process has pushed us a little bit out in time versus our original launch dates. But overall, we would look over the long term for this business for us to continue to have pretty robust growth and to be able over that 4-year time frame to double our revenue on this overall platform. It also includes augmented reality, but more on that to come in the future."

I know there's a lot of one time manufacturing inefficiencies that, that got better in the second quarter. That's helped us and the fact that we also had volume growth up in the high single digits on Display also helped us considerably, and that's how we ended with the 43%. When you look out into Q3, we expect to see growth, we see some of that in Optical Communications and some of it in Display and Specialty Materials. And when you average those out keeping in mind at that Optical Communications gross margins are lower than the corporate average and the others are higher, we ended back at that 43% level. As you look forward, it obviously is going to depend on where the mix of our businesses are. But I think being in that 43-plus percent level certainly what we're aiming call from an overall business standpoint."

As we go through the year, we've seen some stronger demand in what we expected, in particular, in North America but also in Europe but there's been some areas that have been weak or lacking Latin America, the Middle East and Africa and also Japan has been a little bit weaker. When you net that out, it comes back to that 2%. And the other really important factor is what happens with screen size. From a screen size standpoint, we're looking at screen size growth greater than 1.5-inch. So when you add all that together, even though it's a little bit weaker on the other mobile consumer electronics products, that still puts us in that 8% to 10% range."

Can you sort of talk about how that mix plays out in terms of where you are as a percentage or may be shipments roughly and then how Gorilla 5 sort of impacts that mix may be over the next few quarters and also the profits going forward? And then secondly, Tony, just I know you mentioned that cash flows are back-end loaded for the year, but are we still looking at similar expectations as to what you're thinking a year -- a quarter ago or the analyst meeting for cash flow from operations around $3 billion? Or is that may be a little lighter now?"

As we think about what drives our cash flow, we did have a onetime payment, that legal settlement that we've been asked projections originally and then, of course, the other big factors where income actually ends of on a year-over-year basis in our first quarter was obviously softer than what we originally projected. But it's still going to be quite strong, it's still going to be well closer to $3 billion than it would be to say $2.5 billion."

So let me describe in a little broader that [indiscernible] direct answer about what we're trying to do. So the market has a certain dynamic in that how do our customers want to position themselves relative to consumers. And so that's why we have open tours, different products at different price points. So the way Gorilla Glass 3 plays out is we really sort of aimed that at those of our customers who are seeking to get benefits of Gorilla relative to soda lime or other alumina silicate providers where they are highly price-sensitive. And so the more of that we gain, that's all great because as you know the margins of Gorilla are terrific, right? But that price will be moving direct in response to competitors. GG4, GG5, what we're seeking to do there is for those of our customers who want to use -- create absolute premium products that are as thin as can be, and as damage resistant as can be, they're willing to pay for that innovation and therefore, we introduced those product at a premium. Our overall desire is that overall, we can continue to push down the cost of Gorilla, while having the price on average so they not fall so much, and that's exactly what we're trying to do in increasing sort of our one piece of increasing our revenue per device. Now why don't folks don't want us to give guidance on anything like that is back to the customer mix question that I addressed before. Now, which customer does what starts to get really important if you're trying to pick from your gross margin model how everything's going to work out. And in a market that's already pretty tough to predict given how the value chain moves. That added degree of complexity won't make us too accurate. But that you're on exactly what it is we're trying to do and then it will be a mix of how much value type rancid go in certain quarter versus sort of premium cycle upgrade to the new glass. That makes sense, Steven?"

We're going to obviously answer this based on our analysis of the situation, and we do recognize that the yen fluctuates, and that will impact both glass procurement cost for our customers. They buy glass in yen. They sell the panels in dollars. And we also know that our competitors, the Japanese glassmakers could also get a temporary translation demo if the yen strengthens. Well, of course, the temporary loss weakens against the currencies the countries they manufacture. But we don't think this is going to be a big impact on the effect on customers is not as big as it used to be. Glass used to be 15% to 20% of the customer material cost, it's now only about 8%. And then the second factor was our competitors are not as profitable as they used to be and any benefit they get from yen appreciation will only be temporary. So for these reasons, we don't expect to see a meaningful pricing impact a result of the yen movement and the perfect example of that what's happened in Q2 where the yen strengthened considerably but price declines were moderate. So we don't believe this is going to have a big impact, but we recognize there's a couple of areas where we need -- we're obviously monitoring it."

So in macro basically when we talk about OLED, you're only really talking about consumer mobile consumer electronics, right, really phone type business, which is a relatively small, right, really small like a single-digit percent sort of small, sort of percent of where sort so the glass changes in total. Now -- and overall, I think all these adjudications of large size OLED versus large-size LCD, LCD continues to just get stronger and stronger relative. So all we're talking about is that piece. Now there have been rumors about one of our major customers taking some of their capacity that currently makes LCD, large size and take that same plant and make more the small size polyimide OLED. We can't comment whether that's true or not. So let's deal with it in a more theoretical way. So here's what's happened. What sets the overall glass demand is what's happens in the market, which customer of ours makes it, okay, does it impact is the glass demand there or not. In micro, we have some customers who have incredibly eye share and where some customers where we have a moderate share. So what we would expect overall is that we pick up of what our average share is of whatever that market is. So we don't expect that to be a really big market shift for us. And then in specific for us on polyimide OLED is demand there that increases demand on us for glass because our relative share there is very, very high and our relative share in the displays that is replacing, which is basically low-temperature polysilicon displays for phones is lower. So I think overall though you can get some temporal impact, I'm not looking at that as being as huge driver. Makes sense?"

But the screen size being greater, up greater than 1.5 inches, that's driving 5% to 6% growth. And so what we're hearing from the market is yes, television unit growth maybe a little bit softer than what we would have thought in the very beginning of the year, but actually like the previous question, screen size is maybe a little bit bigger than what we thought so it's pushing us in those ranges. But it could be very legitimate that rather coming in around 2, it comes in around 1. I mean, all that's within the range of possibility, and that's why we tried to give you sort of an idea of how to factor the various pieces so you can plug in what it is your opinion is and sort of figure out from that what's going to happen in glass demand. And then the final piece is value chain adjustments are even going to be bigger than that television unit piece. And that's how we all end up at the bottom line and sort of the mid-single digits in square footage growth for us, for the market, and I think that's okay. For Iris, right. So Iris is continuing to get some related commercial transaction with now we're up to a number of customers that are really about evaluating very strongly and some are choosing to launch with it, right? It's still early days. Many of you may have heard me speak, I tend to think about disruptive innovations like this because it's highly disruptive if you're displacing an incumbent technology of PMMA with a brand-new materials to be able to make televisions thinner with smaller bezels. That intend to go in phases as you got to get go from the idea then you get the breakthrough and then if it's really early good, you can get a breakout and then you have to defend your really strong position. I'm getting increasingly confident we're going to have a breakthrough. It's going to penetrate large angulate TVs, and it's going to have meaningful penetration into that. Now whether or not we've got to break out and this becomes a really dominant technology choice for angulate, it's just too early to tell. But the good news is increased commercial transaction is increasing our confidence as you're going to stay start to see some multiple sets, introduce using this technology, and we're going to penetrate the market some. But to be significant, we've got still ways to go."

As you saw in this morning's press release, second quarter results exceeded our expectations with core EPS up 32%, sequentially, to $0.37. 
We told you coming into this year that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest and the momentum would build throughout the year. We still expect that to be the case.  We're very encouraged by our second quarter improvement, and we are confident that we will see both sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and EPS in the third quarter. 
Tony will discuss our results in detail, but before he does, I want to offer some color on the great progress we're making against the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework we announced last October. 
You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. 
No doubt, a highlight of our second quarter progress was closing the realignment of our interest in Dow Corning. In that transaction, we exchanged Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for 100% of a subsidiary that holds an equity interest in Hemlock and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.  The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, unlocking tremendous value for our shareholders.  Our continued ownership interest in Hemlock allows us to capture potential upside from a rebound in the solar market, while also providing market insight and access for our semiconductor innovation programs.  Notably, the realignment was a significant milestone in delivering on our strategy to focus 80% of our resources on our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. 
We are also making steady progress on other aspects of our focused portfolio strategy. Let's take a look at a few examples. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns and deliver new innovations that increase our revenue for Display. 
In May, our Iris Glass earned a Display Component of the Year Award at SID for enabling thinner displays with lower color shift.  This technology replaces plastic light-guide plates, adding a third piece of glass to large edge-lit TVs. And I'm very pleased with the additional commercial transaction that we're gaining on this product. 
In the automotive space, we are reapplying our core technologies and reusing our manufacturing assets to assist manufacturers looking toward connected cars and tighter regulations. Gorilla Glass for auto is a great example. It is 30% lighter than traditional auto glass, offers important safety advantages and provides a superior surface for heads-up displays.  In April, we presented a joint paper at SAE with Ford that demonstrated Gorilla Glass for auto is 2 to 3x stronger in rock strikes with reduced spalling hazards versus soda lime glass.  I'm very much looking forward to reporting more on this topic in the future. 
Our efforts to lead in gas-particulate filters also advanced during the quarter. I remember that, if adopted, this technology increases our revenue by 3 to 4x for gasoline direct injection engines. The exciting news for us is that both Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz announced that they will equip vehicles with gas-particulate filters beginning as early as 2017, and we won several new GPF platforms in quarter 2. 
In mobile consumer electronics, we just announced a new member of the Corning Gorilla Glass family, Gorilla Glass 5. It has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We expect this superior drop performance to translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and to expand the use of Gorilla.  Given the drop performance is the #1 want for consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We should be hearing announcements from them in the near future. 
In the growing optical communications market, we closed on the acquisition of Alliance Fiber Optic Products, bolstering our presence in the high-growth cloud data center market. This acquisition supports our optical market access platform by accelerating our co-innovation strategy and adding new products. We see it strengthening our ability to deliver high-value optical solutions from network operations worldwide. 
We also announced a separate investment in a small company, Versalume, to commercialize our Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber. Fibrance combine Corning's strengths in glass optical physics and fiber manufacturing, but its benefits extend beyond Corning's current market focus. Versalume will enable Fibrance technology to quickly get into the hands of designers and customers in architecture, auto lighting, medical devices, athletic apparel, aerospace and other industries seeking to solve difficult lighting challenges. Versalum demonstrates one way, that we can keep our focus on the core 3, 4, 5 portfolio while still extending the impact of Corning innovation to new markets. 
Those projects illustrate just some of the ways that we will invest $10 billion under the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We believe the investments will produce significant sales growth by extending our leadership in existing markets and positioning us to win in new markets. 
Let's turn to the second part of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework utilizing our financial strength. We've updated the framework in June to recognize significant progress across multiple fronts, including the closing of the Dow Corning transaction. We now expect to generate and deploy deploying more than $26 billion to 2019, up from our previous plan to deploy more than $22 billion. 
Notably, we are raised the lower bound of our commitment to shareholder returns to $12.5 billion through 2019, up from $10 billion.  Cumulatively, since October, we've already returned $3 billion under the framework, including $810 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. 
Today, we are announcing our intention to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which will approximately offset the EPS impact from the loss of Dow Corning's silicones earnings. 
So to summarize, we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, which is designed to deliver secular growth, while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders. We are utilizing our financial strength to invest in our focused portfolio and drive that growth. 
We have raised our planned cash distributions to shareholders to more than $12.5 billion, which is equivalent to about half of Corning's current market capitalization.  We look forward to launching our new $2 billion ASR tomorrow. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Tony?"
173840,370216162,1013756,"Corning Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. We were particularly pleased wit",2670,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. 
We were particularly pleased with our strong operating results, including the strong sequential sales and profit growth in Optical Communications and Display's moderate price declines and strong sequential volume growth. 
In Optical Communications, cable production levels recovered during the second quarter from the first quarter software implementation issue. Combined with strong demand, the recovery resulted in sequential sales growth for Optical up 28%, which was even better than the guidance we provided in April.  Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the further sequential and year-over-year growth we see in the third quarter. 
Now before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I want to briefly point to the 2 primary drivers between our GAAP and core results for this quarter.  First, our GAAP net income includes a $2.7 billion nontaxable gain on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.  Second, similar to the first quarter, this quarter's GAAP results were affected by a $791 million noncash mark-to-market loss that reflects the required accounting treatment for our currency hedge contracts.  I'd like to provide a bit of context. 
As you know, we sell LCD glass in yen and a 1 point move in the exchange rate affects our net income and cash flow translation by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. As you also know, we have currency hedge contracts, predominantly in yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increased the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals. 
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offset much of the decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
In January, we increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 1.06 per $1. For any investor who is worried that a weakening yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting. As we discussed in detail last quarter, GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked to market and recorded at the current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter, we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the current and forward rate -- at the quarter-end forward rate and record the difference in value from the prior quarter-end through the P&L as an unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earnings volatility if the exchange rates changes from quarter to quarter. 
Given the size of our hedged portfolio, these adjustments can be large. For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized noncash gains of $431 million and $410 million, respectively, primarily due to the weakening yen. In the first quarter this year, the yen separately strengthened, driving a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Macroeconomic factors, including concern around Brexit, caused further fluctuation in the yen exchange rate. And overall, it strengthened again over the second quarter, which was the primary factor in the $791 million mark-to-market loss.  Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the yen rate moves. 
To be clear, this GAAP accounting has no impact on our cash flow in the quarter. Actual cash flow in any quarter is determined by the amount of hedge contracts we settle in any given quarter. Our contracts are designed so that the cash received or paid on the contract substantially offset the change in Display's translated earnings and cash flow in that quarter. Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. 
For investors who have additional questions, there is a tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and our team are available after the call. 
Now let's turn to the results for the second quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up sequentially from $2.2 billion in Q1 and exceeding our expectations, driven by Optical Communications. Corporate gross margin was 43%, up more than 200 basis points sequentially and better than our guidance. The uptick reflected the added volume in Optical Communications. 
SG&A was 14% of sales at $342 million, as expected. RD&E costs were flat sequentially and versus last year at $192 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%, as guided. Net income was $434 million, up almost $100 million from Q1. And EPS was $0.37, and above expectations. 
Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. In the second quarter, the display market and our performance tracked with our observations in April. You may recall that in the first quarter, panel makers lowered utilization, which allowed the supply chain to reduce inventory. Glass demand was down sequentially and year-over-year. We expected panel makers to increase utilization in Q2 to meet demand for the second half retail season and for glass demand to grow, and that's what we saw in industry dynamics in recent months. 
At retail, sell-through data May showed demand tracking to our overall expectations for glass area growth of 8% to 10% in 2016. Panel prices across most TV sizes increased and panel makers turned up utilization rates to meet demand for the second quarter. Reach of inventory in the supply chain ended the quarter at a healthy level. Glass supply and demand remains balanced, and our share is stable. As a result of these and other factors, our volume returned to year-over-year growth and was up high single digit sequentially. Price declines were moderate, as expected. 
These dynamics inform our belief that we will see year-over-year volume growth continued in the second half and that moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 8 quarters will continue or even improve, which is good for Corning. 
Second quarter sales and net income in Display were up 6% sequentially, driven by the stronger volume. 
Let's move to Optical Communications. Results snapped back from the first quarter due to strong demand and the return to full production in our cabling facilities towards the end of the quarter. Q2 sales were $782 million, up 28% sequentially and better than we expected. Net income at $86 million was more than triple the first quarter. We are very pleased to be at full production and continue to work hard to meet our commitments to customers. 
In Environmental, Q2 sales were consistent with last year and in line with expectations. Sales of light-duty products for auto were up year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand. This strength was offset by the continued weakness in North America and China for heavy-duty diesel products. 
Truck production in North America is down this year, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second consecutive year, driven by the weakness in their economy.  Net income was consistent with Q1 and in line with our expectations. 
Let's move to Specialty Materials. For the quarter, sales were up 17% sequentially and net income was up 50% on the higher volume. The premium on Gorilla Glass 4 drove a 9% increase in year-over-year net income. 
That said, more broadly, the market for smartphones, tablets and laptop computers is lower than we expected. Worldwide macroeconomic conditions are slowing demand in the emerging markets.  Additionally, there have been fewer major product launches to drive demand and replacement cycle appears to be longer. Our customers are responding to this lower-demand environment.  As a result, Gorilla Glass volume and Specialty Materials sales did not meet expectations in Q2. Segment sales were down 2% versus last year. 
We anticipate this weaker handheld and IT end-market environment will persist through the second half, and we now expect full year sales in Specialty Materials to be consistent with or down slightly from 2015, driven primarily by our performance in Q1. We do expect sequential growth in each quarter. 
Although we expect the overall market to be flat, we are extending our leadership in the cover glass market. First, we are gaining even more share in the aluminosilicate cover glass. Ad second, our ability to innovate and deliver value-add products at a premium price is playing out as we expected.  And as Wendell said, we are attacking, again, with our recent launch of Gorilla Glass 5. We look for innovations like this to drive revenue and income growth even in a maturing market. 
In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were $215 million and met our expectations for low single-igit growth. Net income was $21 million, consistent with last year and higher than Q1 on higher sales. 
Now let's turn to equity earnings. As Wendell said, the close of the Dow Corning realignment in June was a significant milestone for Corning. The transaction adds $4.8 billion in cash to our balance sheet or about 30x Dow Corning's annual silicones' equity earnings and was essentially tax-free. The freedom to deploy that capital is a tremendous value driver for our shareholders.  Because of the timing of the transaction, the equity earning line in our second quarter financial statements reflect only 2 months of Dow Corning's silicones equity earnings, plus a full quarter of Hemlock's equity earnings. 
For your models, the way we will report Hemlock's equity earnings in our income statement going forward is changing. Prior to restructuring, equity earnings in Hemlock was reported in equity earnings on an after-tax basis.  Going forward, it will be reported on a pretax basis, and the taxes will be reported as part of Corning's total tax expenses. 
As you can see from this example on the slide, the contributions to our net income does not change. If you have any questions on this, of course, Ann and her team are happy to help. 
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash growth. We ended the quarter with $7.1 billion of cash, up $3.5 billion in cash at March 31, including approximately $5 billion in the United States. 
Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was up significantly over Q1, as expected, at $595 million. The comparison to 2015 is challenging because this year, we did not receive dividends from Dow Corning in light of the realignment in June. We paid a onetime legal settlement. And net income was lower. We expect operating cash flow to be up even more in the second half. Historically, most of our operating cash flow is generated in the back half of the year. Major drivers of the increase include higher net income, a reduction in working capital and a nonrepeat of front-half-loaded cash expenses. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $810 million worth of common shares outstanding. 
Now for the outlook. Let's begin with Display and the display market. For the full year, our view of end market and glass market growth is unchanged. While there are puts and takes by region, we continued to expect a worldwide TV unit growth of 2% and screen size to increase by more than 1.5 inches. 
As I already mentioned, the outlook for handheld and IT market is lower than our prior expectations, but those segments are relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Therefore, in total for the year, we still expect the overall retail market in square feet to be up 8% to 10%, and we continue to expect the overall glass market in terms of area to be up in the mid-single digits. The first quarter supply chain inventory drive-down accounts for the difference. 
Turning to our third quarter. We're seeing healthy supply chain inventory. Panel makers inventory is lean, and they are further increasing utilization to meet increased demands from set makers.  
As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digit sequentially in the third quarter. We also expect our LCD glass prices the decline moderately sequentially, consistent with Q2. As we have previously explained, we will maintain our stable share strategy and align our operating capacity with market demand, and we continue to expect the more favorable pricing environment will continue or possibly improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization, end-market demand and other market factors very closely, and all indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year, especially in the large Gen sizes as a result of strong TV demand. 
Second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though price declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has declined during that period. Therefore. We expect that their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable.  For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward. 
Moving to Optical Communications. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 10% versus last year, driven by growth in fiber-to-the-home and data centers. 
Turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market but expect weakness in the heavy-duty truck markets in North America and China to continue. We expect third quarter environmental sales to be down slightly year-over-year, driven by foreign exchange. 
In Specialty Materials, we expect sales to be consistent with Q3 last year. This is an 8% up sequentially, driven mainly by volume growth of Gorilla Glass in preparation for new product launches later this year. 
And for the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market for '16 has weakened, which impact sales of Gorilla Glass. As a result, we now expect that sales in Specialty Materials will be consistent or down slightly from last year but will be up sequentially each quarter.  In Life Sciences, we expect Q3 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite a drag from our foreign exchange. 
Turning to the consolidated outlook. We expect the gross margin to be approximately 43% and consistent with Q2. Most margins expand versus last year with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. 
SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 7% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income other expense to be a net expense of approximately $60 million. We expect Q3 total gross equity earnings to be approximately $15 million. As a reminder, we no longer have silicones equity earnings. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 15% to 16% range. 
Now that concludes our outlook for the third quarter. Let me close by saying that we are pleased with the strong sequential growth in sales and earnings in the second quarter. We are confident that Corning's performance will continue to improve with year-over-year sales and EPS growth in both the third and fourth quarters, and we look forward to delivering on our long-term commitments to create strong value. We expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders. We are focusing our portfolio to increase our profitability of success, reduce the of cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition, and we have our rich set of opportunities growth.

So now then you start where do our strategies sort of begin to impact our revenue realization in that slower-growth market as well as what will be the next sort of uptick in the market one way or the other. So let's deal with the second first. Uptick in the market, for us, it really does get driven by how exciting the product our customers come out with and its impact on consumers. So I can't give much insight into that for you, but we do believe that we see some pretty exciting products coming that should help on the total market growth. Now then let's take a look at us in a more micro way. We would normally expect that we're going to grow faster than the market and that, that is because of our superior product, we should be always in any sort of share-gaining mode; as well as that as we introduce higher value-add products, we'll get higher revenue per device. I think, this year, we have an interesting dynamic in that. Customer mix can really make an impact. We have some customers where we do virtually all of the cover class needs and some where we just do the majority. So which customer gets impacted can impact us a little more outsized when you're dealing with the slower-growth market. And then second has just been timing on adoption of some of the higher value-add products and our ability to manufacture. A good example of this is Phire, where we continue to get very good pulp on Phire, especially for wearables, but the difficulty that manufacturing process has pushed us a little bit out in time versus our original launch dates. But overall, we would look over the long term through this business for us to continue to have pretty robust growth and to be able over that 4-year time frame to double our revenue on this overall platform. It also includes things like augmented reality, but more on that to come in the future."

When you look out into Q3, we expect to see growth. We see some of it in Optical Communications and some of it in Display and Specialty Materials. And when you average those out, keeping in your mind that Optical Communications' gross margins are lower than the corporate average and the others' are higher. We end up back at that 43% level.

And the other really important factor is what happens with screen size, and from a screen-size standpoint, we're looking at screen size growth greater than 1.5 inch. So when you add all that together, even though it's a little bit weaker on the other mobile consumer electronics products, that still puts us in that 8% to 10% range."

So let me describe it at a little broader said rather than give you my direct answer about what we're trying to do. So the market has a certain dynamic in that how do our customers want to position themselves relative to consumers. And so that's why we have open to us different products at different price points. So the way Gorilla Glass 3 plays out is we really sort of aim out at those of our customers who are seeking to get benefits of Gorilla relative to soda lime or other aluminosilicate providers that are highly price-sensitive. And so the more of that we gain, that's all great because, as you know, the margins of Gorilla are terrific, right? But that price will be moving direct in response to competitors. GG4, GG5, what we're seeking to do there is for those of our customers who want to use -- create absolute premium products that are as thin as can be and as damage-resistant as can be, they're willing to pay for that innovation. And therefore, we introduced those products at a premium. Our overall desire is that, overall, we can continue to push down the cost of Gorilla, while having the price on average, so to not fall so much. And that's exactly what we're trying to do in increasing sort of our -- one piece of increasing our revenue per device. Now why the folks don't want us to give guidance on anything like that is back to the customer mix question that I addressed before. Now which customer does what starts to get really important if you're trying to pick from your gross margin model, how everything's going to work out, and in a market that's already pretty tough to predict given how the value chain moves. That added degree of complexity won't make us too accurate. But that you're on exactly what it is we're trying to do, and then it'll be a mix of how much value-type brands go in a certain quarter versus sort of premium-cycle upgrade to the new glass. That makes sense, Steven?"

We've got to, obviously, answer this based on our analysis of the situation, and we do recognize that the yen fluctuates and that will impact both glass procurement costs for our customers. And they buy glass in yen. They sell the panels in dollars. And we also know that our competitors, the Japanese glassmakers, could also get temporary translation benefit when the yen strengthens. Well, of course, a temporary loss weakens against the currencies of the countries they manufacture. But we don't think this is going to be a big impact. The effect on customers is not as big as it used to be. Glass used to be 15% to 20% of the customer material cost, it's now only about 8%. And then the second factor was our competitors are not as profitable as they used to be, and any benefit they get from yen appreciation will only be temporary. So for these reasons, we don't expect to see a meaningful pricing impact, a result of the yen movement. And the perfect example of that's what happened in Q2, where the yen strengthened considerably but price declines were moderate. So we don't believe this is going to have a big impact, but we recognize there's a couple of areas where we need to -- we are obviously monitoring it."

So in macro, basically when we talk about OLED, you're only really talking about consumer -- mobile consumer electronics, right, really phone-type business, which is a relatively small, right, really small like a single-digit percent sort of small, sort of percent of where sort so the glass changes in total. Now -- and overall, I think all the adjudication of large-size OLED versus large-size LCD, LCD continues to just get stronger and stronger relative. So all we're talking about is that piece. Now there have been rumors about one of our major customers taking some of their capacity that currently makes LCD, large size, and take that same plant and make more of the small-size polyimide OLED. We can't comment on is that true or not, but let's deal with it in a more theoretical way. So here is what happens. What sets the overall glass demand is going to be: What happens in the market? Which customer of ours makes it, okay? Does it impact? Is the glass demand there or not? In micro, we have some customers where we have incredibly high share and some customers where we have more moderate share. So what we would expect overall, though, is that we pick up what our average share is of whatever that market is. So we don't expect that to be a really big market shift for us. And then in specific for us on polyimide OLED is demand there that increases demand on us for glass, because our relative share there is very, very high and our relative share in the displays that is replacing, which is basically low-temperature polysilicon displays for phones, is lower. So I think overall though you can get some temporal impact. I'm not looking at that as being as huge driver. Makes sense?"

But the screen size being greater, up greater than 1.5 inches, that's driving 5% to 6% growth. And so what we're hearing sort of on the market is, yes, television unit growth may be a little bit softer than what we would have thought in the very beginning of the year, but actually like the previous question, screen size is maybe a little bit bigger than what we thought, so it's pushing us in those ranges. But it could be very legitimate that rather than coming in around 2, it comes in around 1. I mean, all that's within the range of possibility, and that's why we try to give you sort of an idea of how to factor the various pieces so you can plug in what it is your opinion is and then sort of figure out from that what's going to happen in glass demand.

It's still early days. It's not many of you may have heard me speak. I tend to think about disruptive innovations like this because it's highly disruptive. You're displacing an incumbent technology of PMMA with brand new materials that to be able to make televisions thinner and with smaller bezels. That intend to go in phases as you're going to kind of go from the idea, then you get a breakthrough, and then if it's really early good, you can get a breakout and then you have to defend your really strong position. I'm getting increasingly confident we're going to have a breakthrough. It's going to penetrate large angulate TVs, and it's going to have a meaningful penetration into that. Now whether or not we got to break out and this becomes a really dominant technology choice for angulate, it's just too early to tell. But the good news is, the increased commercial transaction is increasing our confidence as you're going to start to see some multiple sets introduce using this technology and we're going to penetrate the market some. But to be significant, we still got ways to go."

As you saw in this morning's press release, second quarter results exceeded our expectations with core EPS up 32%, sequentially, to $0.37. 
We told you coming into this year that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest and that momentum would build throughout the year. We still expect that to be the case.  We're very encouraged by our second quarter improvement, and we are confident that we will see both sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and EPS in the third quarter. 
Tony will discuss our results in detail, but before he does, I want to offer some color on the great progress we're making against the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework we announced last October. 
You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. 
No doubt, a highlight of our second quarter progress was closing the realignment of our interest in Dow Corning. In that transaction, we exchanged Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for 100% of a subsidiary that holds an equity interest in Hemlock and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.  The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, unlocking tremendous value for our shareholders.  Our continued ownership interest in Hemlock allows us to capture potential upside from a rebound in the solar market, while also providing market insight and access for our semiconductor innovation programs.  Notably, the realignment was a significant milestone in delivering on our strategy to focus 80% of our resources on our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. 
We are also making steady progress on other aspects of our focused portfolio strategy. Let's take a look at a few examples. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns and deliver new innovations that increase our revenue for Display. 
In May, our Iris Glass earned a Display Component of the Year Award at SID for enabling thinner displays with lower color shift.  This technology replaces plastic light-guide plates, adding a third piece of glass to large edge-lit TVs. And I'm very pleased with the additional commercial transaction that we're gaining on this product. 
In the automotive space, we are reapplying our core technologies and reusing our manufacturing assets to assist manufacturers looking toward connected cars and tighter regulations. Gorilla Glass for auto is a great example. It is 30% lighter than traditional auto glass, offers important safety advantages and provides a superior surface for heads-up displays.  In April, we presented a joint paper at SAE with Ford that demonstrated Gorilla Glass for auto is 2 to 3x stronger in rock strikes with reduced spalling hazards versus soda lime glass. I'm very much looking forward to reporting more on this topic in the future. 
Our efforts to lead in gas-particulate filters also advanced during the quarter. Now, remember that, if adopted, this technology increases our revenue by 3 to 4x for gasoline direct injection engines. The exciting news for us is that both Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz announced that they will equip vehicles with gas-particulate filters beginning as early as 2017, and we won several new GPF platforms in quarter 2. 
In mobile consumer electronics, we just announced a new member of the Corning Gorilla Glass family, Gorilla Glass 5. It has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop-height-to-failure versus competitive glass designs. We expect this superior drop performance to translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and to expand the use of Gorilla.  Given that drop performance is the #1 want for consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We should be hearing announcements from them in the near future. 
In the growing optical communications market, we closed on the acquisition of Alliance Fiber Optic Products, bolstering our presence in the high-growth cloud data center market. This acquisition supports our optical market access platform by accelerating our co-innovation strategy and adding new products. We see it strengthening our ability to deliver high-value optical solutions from network operations worldwide. 
We also announced a separate investment in a small company, Versalume, to commercialize our Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber. Fibrance combines Corning's strengths in glass, optical physics and fiber manufacturing, but its benefits extend beyond Corning's current market focus. Versalume will enable Fibrance technology to quickly get into the hands of designers and customers in architecture, auto lighting, medical devices, athletic apparel, aerospace and other industries seeking to solve difficult lighting challenges. Versalum demonstrates one way that we can keep our focus on the core 3, 4, 5 portfolio while still extending the impact of Corning innovation to new markets. 
Those projects illustrate just some of the ways that we will invest $10 billion under the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We believe the investments will produce significant sales growth by extending our leadership in existing markets and positioning us to win in new markets. 
Let's turn to the second part of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework: utilizing our financial strength. We updated the framework in June to recognize significant progress across multiple fronts, including the closing of the Dow Corning transaction. We now expect to generate and deploy more than $26 billion to 2019, up from our previous plan to deploy more than $22 billion. 
Notably, we raised the lower bound of our commitment to shareholder returns to $12.5 billion through 2019, up from $10 billion.  Cumulatively, since October, we've already returned $3 billion under the framework, including $810 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. 
Today, we are announcing our intention to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which will approximately offset the EPS impact from the loss of Dow Corning's silicones earnings. 
So to summarize, we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, which is designed to deliver secular growth, while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders. We are utilizing our financial strength to invest in our focused portfolio and drive that growth. 
We have raised our planned cash distributions to shareholders to more than $12.5 billion, which is equivalent to about half of Corning's current market capitalization.  We look forward to launching our new $2 billion ASR tomorrow. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Tony?"
173840,370216162,1013999,"Corning Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. We were particularly pleased wit",2666,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. 
We were particularly pleased with our strong operating results, including the strong sequential sales and profit growth in Optical Communications and Display's moderate price declines and strong sequential volume growth. 
In Optical Communications, cable production levels recovered during the second quarter from the first quarter software implementation issue. Combined with strong demand, the recovery resulted in sequential sales growth for Optical up 28%, which was even better than the guidance we provided in April.  Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the further sequential and year-over-year growth we see in the third quarter. 
Now, before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I want to briefly point to the 2 primary drivers between our GAAP and core results for this quarter.  First, our GAAP net income includes a $2.7 billion nontaxable gain on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.  Second, similar to the first quarter, this quarter's GAAP results were affected by a $791 million noncash mark-to-market loss that reflects the required accounting treatment for our currency hedge contracts.  I'd like to provide a bit of context. 
As you know, we sell LCD glass in yen and a 1 point move in the exchange rate affects our net income and cash flow translation by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. As you also know, we have currency hedge contracts, predominantly in yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals. 
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offset much of the decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
In January, we increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 1.06 per $1. For any investor who is worried that a weakening yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now, let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting. As we discussed in detail last quarter, GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked to market and recorded at the current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter, we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the current and forward rate -- at the quarter-end forward rate and record the difference in value from the prior quarter-end through the P&L as an unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earnings volatility if the exchange rates changes from quarter-to-quarter. 
Given the size of our hedged portfolio, these adjustments can be large. For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized noncash gains of $431 million and $410 million, respectively, primarily due to the weakening yen. In the first quarter this year, the yen sharply strengthened, driving a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Macroeconomic factors, including concern around Brexit, caused further fluctuation in the yen exchange rate. And overall, it strengthened again over the second quarter, which was the primary factor in the $791 million mark-to-market loss.  Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the yen rate moves. 
To be clear, this GAAP accounting has no impact on our cash flow in the quarter. Actual cash flow in any quarter is determined by the amount of hedge contracts we settle in any given quarter. Our contracts are designed so that the cash received or paid on the contract substantially offset the change in Display's translated yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter. Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. 
For investors who have additional questions, there is a tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and our team are available after the call. 
Now, let's turn to the results for the second quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up sequentially from $2.2 billion in Q1 and exceeding our expectations, driven by Optical Communications. Corporate gross margin was 43%, up more than 200 basis points sequentially and better than our guidance. The uptick reflected the added volume in Optical Communications. 
SG&A was 14% of sales at $342 million, as expected. RD&E costs were flat sequentially and versus last year at $192 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%, as guided. Net income was $434 million, up almost $100 million from Q1. And EPS was $0.37, and above expectations. 
Now, let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. In the second quarter, the display market and our performance tracked with our observations in April. You may recall that in the first quarter, panel makers lowered utilization, which allowed the supply chain to reduce inventory. Glass demand was down sequentially and year-over-year. We expected panel makers to increase utilization in Q2 to meet demand for the second-half retail season and for glass demand to grow, and that's what we saw in industry dynamics in recent months. 
At retail, sell-through data through May showed demand tracking to our overall expectations for glass area growth of 8% to 10% in 2016. Panel prices across most TV sizes increased and panel makers turned up utilization rates to meet demand for the second quarter. Weeks-of-inventory in the supply chain ended the quarter at a healthy level. Glass supply and demand remains balanced, and our share is stable. As a result of these and other factors, our volume returned to year-over-year growth and was up high single digits sequentially. Price declines were moderate, as expected. 
These dynamics inform our belief that we will see year-over-year volume growth continued in the second half and that moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 8 quarters will continue or even improve, which is good for Corning. 
Second quarter sales and net income in Display were up 6% sequentially, driven by the stronger volume. 
Let's move to Optical Communications. Results snapped back from the first quarter due to strong demand and the return to full production in our cabling facilities towards the end of the quarter. Q2 sales were $782 million, up 28% sequentially and better than we expected. Net income at $86 million was more than triple the first quarter. We are very pleased to be at full production and continue to work hard to meet our commitments to customers. 
In Environmental, Q2 sales were consistent with last year and in line with expectations. Sales of light-duty products for auto were up year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand. This strength was offset by the continued weakness in North America and China for heavy-duty diesel products. 
Truck production in North America is down this year, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second consecutive year, driven by the weakness in their economy.  Net income was consistent with Q1 and in line with our expectations. 
Let's move to Specialty Materials. For the quarter, sales were up 17% sequentially and net income was up 50% on the higher volume. The premium on Gorilla Glass 4 drove a 9% increase in year-over-year net income. 
That said, more broadly, the market for smartphones, tablets and laptop computers is lower than we expected. Worldwide macroeconomic conditions are slowing demand in the emerging markets.  Additionally, there have been fewer major product launches to drive demand and replacement cycle appears to be longer. Our customers are responding to this lower-demand environment.  As a result, Gorilla Glass volume and Specialty Materials sales did not meet expectations in Q2. Segment sales were down 2% versus last year. 
We anticipate this weaker handheld and IT end-market environment will persist through the second half, and we now expect full year sales in Specialty Materials to be consistent with or down slightly from 2015, driven primarily by our performance in Q1. We do expect sequential growth in each quarter. 
Although we expect the overall market to be flat, we are extending our leadership in the cover glass market. First, we are gaining even more share in the aluminosilicate cover glass. And second, our ability to innovate and deliver value-add products at a premium price is playing out as we expected.  And as Wendell said, we are attacking, again, with our recent launch of Gorilla Glass 5. We look for innovations like this to drive revenue and income growth even in a maturing market. 
In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were $215 million and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million, consistent with last year and higher than Q1 on higher sales. 
Now, let's turn to equity earnings. As Wendell said, the close of the Dow Corning realignment in June was a significant milestone for Corning. The transaction adds $4.8 billion in cash to our balance sheet or about 30x Dow Corning's annual silicones' equity earnings and was essentially tax-free. The freedom to deploy that capital is a tremendous value driver for our shareholders.  Because of the timing of the transaction, the equity earning line in our second quarter financial statements reflect only 2 months of Dow Corning's silicones equity earnings, plus a full quarter of Hemlock's equity earnings. 
For your models, the way we will report Hemlock's equity earnings in our income statement going forward is changing. Prior to restructuring, equity earnings in Hemlock was reported in equity earnings on an after-tax basis.  Going forward, it will be reported on a pretax basis, and the taxes will be reported as part of Corning's total tax expenses. 
As you can see from this example on the slide, the contributions to our net income does not change. If you have any questions on this, of course, Ann and her team are happy to help. 
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $7.1 billion of cash, up $3.5 billion in cash at March 31, including approximately $5 billion in the United States. 
Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was up significantly over Q1, as expected, at $595 million. The comparison to 2015 is challenging because this year, we did not receive dividends from Dow Corning in light of the realignment in June. We paid a onetime legal settlement. And net income was lower. We expect operating cash flow to be up even more in the second half. Historically, most of our operating cash flow is generated in the back half of the year. Major drivers of the increase include higher net income, a reduction in working capital and a nonrepeat of front-half-loaded cash expenses. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $810 million worth of common shares outstanding. 
Now for the outlook. Let's begin with Display and the display market. For the full year, our view of end market and glass market growth is unchanged. While there are puts and takes by region, we continue to expect worldwide TV unit growth of 2% and screen size to increase by more than 1.5 inches. 
As I already mentioned, the outlook for handheld and IT market is lower than our prior expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Therefore, in total for the year, we still expect the overall retail market in square feet to be up 8% to 10%, and we continue to expect the overall glass market in terms of area to be up in the mid-single digits. The first quarter supply chain inventory drive-down accounts for the difference. 
Turning to our third quarter. We're seeing healthy supply chain inventory. Panel makers' inventory is lean, and they are further increasing utilization to meet increased demands from set makers.  
As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digit sequentially in the third quarter. We also expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially, consistent with Q2. As we have previously explained, we will maintain our stable share strategy and align our operating capacity with market demand, and we continue to expect the more favorable pricing environment will continue or possibly improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization, end-market demand and other market factors very closely, and all indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year, especially in the large Gen sizes as a result of strong TV demand. 
Second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though price declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has declined during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable.  For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward. 
Moving to Optical Communications. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 10% versus last year, driven by growth in fiber-to-the-home and data centers. 
Turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect weakness in the heavy-duty truck markets in North America and China to continue. We expect third quarter Environmental sales to be down slightly year-over-year, driven by foreign exchange. 
In Specialty Materials, we expect sales to be consistent with Q3 last year. This is an 8% up sequentially, driven mainly by volume growth of Gorilla Glass in preparation for new product launches later this year. 
And for the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market for '16 has weakened, which impacts sales of Gorilla Glass. As a result, we now expect that sales in Specialty Materials will be consistent or down slightly from last year, but will be up sequentially each quarter.  In Life Sciences, we expect Q3 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite a drag from our foreign exchange. 
Turning to the consolidated outlook. We expect the gross margin to be approximately 43% and consistent with Q2. Most margins expand versus last year with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. 
SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 7% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $60 million. We expect Q3 total gross equity earnings to be approximately $15 million. As a reminder, we no longer have silicones' equity earnings. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 15% to 16% range. 
Now, that concludes our outlook for the third quarter. Let me close by saying that we are pleased with the strong sequential growth in sales and earnings in the second quarter. We are confident that Corning's performance will continue to improve with year-over-year sales and EPS growth in both the third and fourth quarters, and we look forward to delivering on our long-term commitments to create strong value. We expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders. We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the of cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition, and we have a rich set of growth opportunities.

So now, then, you start where do our strategies sort of begin to impact our revenue realization in that slower-growth market as well as what will be the next sort of uptick in the market, one way or the other. So let's deal with the second first. Uptick in the market, for us, it really does get driven by how exciting the product our customers come out with and its impact on consumers. So I can't give much insight into that for you, but we do believe that we see some pretty exciting products coming that should help on the total market growth. Now then, let's take a look at us in a more micro way. We would normally expect that we're going to grow faster than the market and that, that is because of our superior product, we should be always in any sort of share-gaining mode; as well as that as we introduce higher value-add products, we'll get higher revenue per device. I think, this year, we have an interesting dynamic in that customer mix can really make an impact. We have some customers where we do virtually all of their cover class needs and some where we just do the majority. So which customer gets impacted can impact us a little more outsized when you're dealing with the slower-growth market. And then second has just been timing on adoption of some of the higher value-add products and our ability to manufacture. A good example of this is Phire, where we continue to get pretty good pull on Phire, especially for wearables, but the difficulty of that manufacturing process has pushed us a little bit out in time versus our original launch dates. But overall, we would look over the long term for this business for us to continue to have pretty robust growth and to be able, over that 4-year time frame, to double our revenue on this overall platform. It also includes things like augmented reality, but more on that to come in the future."

I think, compared to Q1, there were really 2 things. One was the Optical Communications' improvement both in terms of sales, but the amount of money that we were spending on our software project issue also reduced during the quarter. There's a lot of onetime manufacturing inefficiencies that got better in the second quarter. That helped us. And the fact that we also had volume growth up in the high single digits on Display also helped us considerably, and that's how we ended with the 43%. When you look out into Q3, we expect to see growth. We see some of it in Optical Communications and some of it in Display and Specialty Materials. And when you average those out, keeping in mind that Optical Communications' gross margins are lower than the corporate average and the others' are higher, we end up back at that 43% level. As you look forward, it obviously is going to depend on where the mix of our businesses are.

And we expect that TV units are going to speed up 2% on a year-over-year basis. As we go through the year, we've seen some stronger demand than what we expected, in particular in North America but also in Europe. But there have been some areas that have been weaker, like in Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and also Japan has been a little bit weaker. When you net that out, it comes back to that 2%. And the other really important factor is what happens with screen size, and from a screen-size standpoint, we're looking at screen size growth greater than 1.5 inch. So when you add all that together, even though it's a little bit weaker on the other mobile consumer electronics products, that still puts us in that 8% to 10% range."

So let me describe in at a little broader sense rather than give you my direct answer about what we're trying to do. So the market has a certain dynamic in that how do our customers want to position themselves relative to consumers. And so that's why we have open to us different products at different price points. So the way Gorilla Glass 3 plays out is we really sort of aim out at those of our customers who are seeking to get benefits of Gorilla relative to soda lime or other aluminosilicate providers but are highly price-sensitive. And so the more of that we gain, that's all great because, as you know, the margins of Gorilla are terrific, right? But that price will be moving direct in response to competitors. GG4, GG5, what we're seeking to do there is for those of our customers who want to use -- create absolute premium products that are as thin as can be and as damage-resistant as can be, they're willing to pay for that innovation. And therefore, we introduce those products at a premium. Our overall desire is that, overall, we can continue to push down the cost of Gorilla, while having the price on average, so to not fall so much. And that's exactly what we're trying to do in increasing sort of our -- one piece of increasing our revenue per device. Now, why the folks don't want us to give guidance on anything like that is back to the customer mix question that I addressed before. Now, which customer does what starts to get really important if you're trying to pick from your gross margin model, how everything's going to work out. And in a market that's already pretty tough to predict given how the value chain moves, that added degree of complexity won't make us too accurate. But that -- you're on exactly what it is we're trying to do, and then it'll be a mix of how much value-type brands go in a certain quarter versus sort of premium-cycle upgrade to the new glass.

We've got to, obviously, answer this based on our analysis of the situation, and we do recognize that the yen fluctuates and that will impact both glass procurement costs for our customers. And they buy glass in yen; they sell the panels in dollars. And we also know that our competitors, the Japanese glassmakers, could also get a temporary translation benefit when the yen strengthens or, of course, a temporary loss when it weakens against the currencies of the countries they manufacture. But we don't think this is going to be a big impact. The effect on customers is not as big as it used to be. Glass used to be 15% to 20% of the customer material cost; it's now only about 8%. And then the second factor was our competitors are not as profitable as they used to be, and any benefit they get from yen appreciation may only be temporary. So for these reasons, we don't expect to see a meaningful pricing impact, a result of the yen movement. And the perfect example of that's what happened in Q2, where the yen strengthened considerably but price declines were moderate. So we don't believe this is going to have a big impact, but we recognize there's a couple of areas where we need to -- that we are obviously monitoring it."

So in macro, basically when we talk about OLED, you're only really talking about consumer -- mobile consumer electronics, right, really phone-type business, which is a relatively small, right, really small like under a single-digit percent sort of small, sort of percent of where sort of glass changes in total. Now -- and overall, I think all the adjudication of large-size OLED versus large-size LCD, LCD continues to just get stronger and stronger relative. So all we're talking about is that piece. Now, there have been rumors about one of our major customers taking some of their capacity that currently makes LCD, large size, and take that same plant and make more of the small-size polyimide OLED. We can't comment on is that true or not, but let's deal with it in a more theoretical way. So here is what happens. What sets the overall glass demand is going to be: What happens in the market? Which customer of ours makes it, okay? Does it impact? Is the glass demand there or not? In micro, we have some customers where we have incredibly high share and some customers where we have more moderate share. So what we would expect overall, though, is that we pick up what our average share is of whatever that market is. So we don't expect that to be a really big market shift for us. And then, in specific for us on polyimide OLED is demand there net increases demand on us for glass because our relative share there is very, very high and our relative share in the displays it is replacing, which is basically low-temperature polysilicon displays for phones, is lower.

But whether or not you thought TV units were going to be up 1%, up 2% or even relatively flat, that you can remember, I think we actually showed it to you on this slide on the 2016 outlook when Tony was going through his talk, that TV units up about 2% would be a growth contribution in glass area by about 2%. But the screen size being greater, up greater than 1.5 inches, that's driving 5% to 6% growth. And so what we're hearing sort of from the market is, yes, television unit growth may be a little bit softer than what we would have thought in the very beginning of the year, but actually like the previous question, screen size is maybe a little bit bigger than what we thought, so it's pushing us in those ranges. But it could be very legitimate that rather than coming in around 2, it comes in around 1. I mean, all that's within the range of possibility, and that's why we try to give you sort of an idea of how to factor the various pieces so you can plug in what it is your opinion is and then sort of figure out from that what's going to happen in glass demand. And then, the final piece is value chain adjustments are even going to be bigger than that television unit piece. And that's how we all end up at the bottom line at sort of the mid-single digits in square footage growth for us, for the market, and I think that's okay. Oh, Iris, right. So Iris is continuing to get some really good commercial transaction with -- now we're up to a number of customers that are really evaluating it very strongly and some are choosing to launch with it, right? It's still early days. It's -- many of you may have heard me speak, I tend to think about disruptive innovations like this because it's highly disruptive. You're displacing an incumbent technology of PMMA with a brand new material set to be able to make televisions thinner and with smaller bezels. That -- it tends to go in phases. You've got to kind of go from the idea, then you get a breakthrough, and then if it's really good, you can get a breakout and then you have to defend your really strong position. I'm getting increasingly confident we're going to have a breakthrough. It's going to penetrate large, edge-lit TVs, and it's going to have a meaningful penetration into that. Now, whether or not we got to break out and this becomes a really dominant technology choice for edge-lit, it's just too early to tell. But the good news is, the increased commercial transaction is increasing our confidence that you're going to start to see some multiple sets introduced using this technology, and we're going to penetrate the market some. But for it to be significant, we still got a ways to go."

As you saw in this morning's press release, second quarter results exceeded our expectations with core EPS up 32%, sequentially, to $0.37. 
We told you coming into this year that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest and that momentum would build throughout the year. We still expect that to be the case.  We're very encouraged by our second quarter improvement, and we are confident that we will see both sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and EPS in the third quarter. 
Tony will discuss our results in detail, but before he does, I want to offer some color on the great progress we're making against the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework we announced last October. 
You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. 
No doubt, a highlight of our second quarter progress was closing the realignment of our interest in Dow Corning. In that transaction, we exchanged Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for 100% of a subsidiary that holds an equity interest in Hemlock and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.  The $4.8 billion is approximately 30x the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, unlocking tremendous value for our shareholders.  Our continued ownership interest in Hemlock allows us to capture potential upside from a rebound in the solar market, while also providing market insight and access for our semiconductor innovation programs.  Notably, the realignment was a significant milestone in delivering on our strategy to focus 80% of our resources on our 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. 
We are also making steady progress on other aspects of our focused portfolio strategy. Let's take a look at a few examples. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns and deliver new innovations that increase our revenue for Display. 
In May, our Iris Glass earned a Display Component of the Year Award at SID for enabling thinner displays with lower color shift.  This technology replaces plastic light-guide plates, adding a third piece of glass to large edge-lit TVs. And I'm very pleased with the additional commercial transaction that we're gaining on this product. 
In the automotive space, we are reapplying our core technologies and reusing our manufacturing assets to assist manufacturers looking toward connected cars and tighter regulations. Gorilla Glass for auto is a great example. It is 30% lighter than traditional auto glass, offers important safety advantages and provides a superior surface for heads-up displays.  In April, we presented a joint paper at SAE with Ford that demonstrated Gorilla Glass for auto is 2 to 3x stronger in rock strikes with reduced spalling hazards versus soda lime glass. I'm very much looking forward to reporting more on this topic in the future. 
Our efforts to lead in gas-particulate filters also advanced during the quarter. Now, remember that, if adopted, this technology increases our revenue by 3 to 4x for gasoline direct injection engines. The exciting news for us is that both Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz announced that they will equip vehicles with gas-particulate filters beginning as early as 2017, and we won several new GPF platforms in quarter 2. 
In mobile consumer electronics, we just announced a new member of the Corning Gorilla Glass family, Gorilla Glass 5. It has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop-height-to-failure versus competitive glass designs. We expect this superior drop performance to translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and to expand the use of Gorilla.  Given that drop performance is the #1 want for consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We should be hearing announcements from them in the near future. 
In the growing optical communications market, we closed on the acquisition of Alliance Fiber Optic Products, bolstering our presence in the high-growth cloud data center market. This acquisition supports our optical market access platform by accelerating our co-innovation strategy and adding new products. We see it strengthening our ability to deliver high-value optical solutions from network operations worldwide. 
We also announced a separate investment in a small company, Versalume, to commercialize our Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber. Fibrance combines Corning's strengths in glass, optical physics and fiber manufacturing, but its benefits extend beyond Corning's current market focus. Versalume will enable Fibrance technology to quickly get into the hands of designers and customers in architecture, auto lighting, medical devices, athletic apparel, aerospace and other industries seeking to solve difficult lighting challenges. Versalum demonstrates one way that we can keep our focus on the core 3, 4, 5 portfolio while still extending the impact of Corning innovation to new markets. 
Those projects illustrate just some of the ways that we will invest $10 billion under the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We believe the investments will produce significant sales growth by extending our leadership in existing markets and positioning us to win in new markets. 
Let's turn to the second part of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework: utilizing our financial strength. We updated the framework in June to recognize significant progress across multiple fronts, including the closing of the Dow Corning transaction. We now expect to generate and deploy more than $26 billion to 2019, up from our previous plan to deploy more than $22 billion. 
Notably, we raised the lower bound of our commitment to shareholder returns to $12.5 billion through 2019, up from $10 billion.  Cumulatively, since October, we've already returned $3 billion under the framework, including $810 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. 
Today, we are announcing our intention to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which will approximately offset the EPS impact from the loss of Dow Corning's silicones earnings. 
So to summarize, we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, which is designed to deliver secular growth, while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders. We are utilizing our financial strength to invest in our focused portfolio and drive that growth. 
We have raised our planned cash distributions to shareholders to more than $12.5 billion, which is equivalent to about half of Corning's current market capitalization.  We look forward to launching our new $2 billion ASR tomorrow. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Tony?"
173840,370216162,1014577,"Corning Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. We were particularly pleased wit",2666,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. 
We were particularly pleased with our strong operating results, including the strong sequential sales and profit growth in Optical Communications and Display's moderate price declines and strong sequential volume growth. 
In Optical Communications, cable production levels recovered during the second quarter from the first quarter software implementation issue. Combined with strong demand, the recovery resulted in sequential sales growth for Optical up 28%, which was even better than the guidance we provided in April.  Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the further sequential and year-over-year growth we see in the third quarter. 
Now, before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I want to briefly point to the 2 primary drivers between our GAAP and core results for this quarter.  First, our GAAP net income includes a $2.7 billion nontaxable gain on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.  Second, similar to the first quarter, this quarter's GAAP results were affected by a $791 million noncash mark-to-market loss that reflects the required accounting treatment for our currency hedge contracts.  I'd like to provide a bit of context. 
As you know, we sell LCD glass in yen and a 1 point move in the exchange rate affects our net income and cash flow translation by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. As you also know, we have currency hedge contracts, predominantly in yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals. 
We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offset much of the decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
In January, we increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 1.06 per $1. For any investor who is worried that a weakening yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern. 
Now, let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting. As we discussed in detail last quarter, GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked to market and recorded at the current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter, we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the current and forward rate -- at the quarter-end forward rate and record the difference in value from the prior quarter-end through the P&L as an unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earnings volatility if the exchange rates changes from quarter-to-quarter. 
Given the size of our hedged portfolio, these adjustments can be large. For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized noncash gains of $431 million and $410 million, respectively, primarily due to the weakening yen. In the first quarter this year, the yen sharply strengthened, driving a $599 million unrealized noncash mark-to-market loss. Macroeconomic factors, including concern around Brexit, caused further fluctuation in the yen exchange rate. And overall, it strengthened again over the second quarter, which was the primary factor in the $791 million mark-to-market loss.  Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the yen rate moves. 
To be clear, this GAAP accounting has no impact on our cash flow in the quarter. Actual cash flow in any quarter is determined by the amount of hedge contracts we settle in any given quarter. Our contracts are designed so that the cash received or paid on the contract substantially offset the change in Display's translated yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter. Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. 
For investors who have additional questions, there is a tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and our team are available after the call. 
Now, let's turn to the results for the second quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up sequentially from $2.2 billion in Q1 and exceeding our expectations, driven by Optical Communications. Corporate gross margin was 43%, up more than 200 basis points sequentially and better than our guidance. The uptick reflected the added volume in Optical Communications. 
SG&A was 14% of sales at $342 million, as expected. RD&E costs were flat sequentially and versus last year at $192 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%, as guided. Net income was $434 million, up almost $100 million from Q1. And EPS was $0.37, and above expectations. 
Now, let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. In the second quarter, the display market and our performance tracked with our observations in April. You may recall that in the first quarter, panel makers lowered utilization, which allowed the supply chain to reduce inventory. Glass demand was down sequentially and year-over-year. We expected panel makers to increase utilization in Q2 to meet demand for the second-half retail season and for glass demand to grow, and that's what we saw in industry dynamics in recent months. 
At retail, sell-through data through May showed demand tracking to our overall expectations for glass area growth of 8% to 10% in 2016. Panel prices across most TV sizes increased and panel makers turned up utilization rates to meet demand for the second quarter. Weeks-of-inventory in the supply chain ended the quarter at a healthy level. Glass supply and demand remains balanced, and our share is stable. As a result of these and other factors, our volume returned to year-over-year growth and was up high single digits sequentially. Price declines were moderate, as expected. 
These dynamics inform our belief that we will see year-over-year volume growth continued in the second half and that moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 8 quarters will continue or even improve, which is good for Corning. 
Second quarter sales and net income in Display were up 6% sequentially, driven by the stronger volume. 
Let's move to Optical Communications. Results snapped back from the first quarter due to strong demand and the return to full production in our cabling facilities towards the end of the quarter. Q2 sales were $782 million, up 28% sequentially and better than we expected. Net income at $86 million was more than triple the first quarter. We are very pleased to be at full production and continue to work hard to meet our commitments to customers. 
In Environmental, Q2 sales were consistent with last year and in line with expectations. Sales of light-duty products for auto were up year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand. This strength was offset by the continued weakness in North America and China for heavy-duty diesel products. 
Truck production in North America is down this year, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second consecutive year, driven by the weakness in their economy.  Net income was consistent with Q1 and in line with our expectations. 
Let's move to Specialty Materials. For the quarter, sales were up 17% sequentially and net income was up 50% on the higher volume. The premium on Gorilla Glass 4 drove a 9% increase in year-over-year net income. 
That said, more broadly, the market for smartphones, tablets and laptop computers is lower than we expected. Worldwide macroeconomic conditions are slowing demand in the emerging markets.  Additionally, there have been fewer major product launches to drive demand and replacement cycle appears to be longer. Our customers are responding to this lower-demand environment.  As a result, Gorilla Glass volume and Specialty Materials sales did not meet expectations in Q2. Segment sales were down 2% versus last year. 
We anticipate this weaker handheld and IT end-market environment will persist through the second half, and we now expect full year sales in Specialty Materials to be consistent with or down slightly from 2015, driven primarily by our performance in Q1. We do expect sequential growth in each quarter. 
Although we expect the overall market to be flat, we are extending our leadership in the cover glass market. First, we are gaining even more share in the aluminosilicate cover glass. And second, our ability to innovate and deliver value-add products at a premium price is playing out as we expected.  And as Wendell said, we are attacking, again, with our recent launch of Gorilla Glass 5. We look for innovations like this to drive revenue and income growth even in a maturing market. 
In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were $215 million and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million, consistent with last year and higher than Q1 on higher sales. 
Now, let's turn to equity earnings. As Wendell said, the close of the Dow Corning realignment in June was a significant milestone for Corning. The transaction adds $4.8 billion in cash to our balance sheet or about 30x Dow Corning's annual silicones' equity earnings and was essentially tax-free. The freedom to deploy that capital is a tremendous value driver for our shareholders.  Because of the timing of the transaction, the equity earning line in our second quarter financial statements reflect only 2 months of Dow Corning's silicones equity earnings, plus a full quarter of Hemlock's equity earnings. 
For your models, the way we will report Hemlock's equity earnings in our income statement going forward is changing. Prior to restructuring, equity earnings in Hemlock was reported in equity earnings on an after-tax basis.  Going forward, it will be reported on a pretax basis, and the taxes will be reported as part of Corning's total tax expenses. 
As you can see from this example on the slide, the contributions to our net income does not change. If you have any questions on this, of course, Ann and her team are happy to help. 
Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $7.1 billion of cash, up $3.5 billion in cash at March 31, including approximately $5 billion in the United States. 
Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was up significantly over Q1, as expected, at $595 million. The comparison to 2015 is challenging because this year, we did not receive dividends from Dow Corning in light of the realignment in June. We paid a onetime legal settlement. And net income was lower. We expect operating cash flow to be up even more in the second half. Historically, most of our operating cash flow is generated in the back half of the year. Major drivers of the increase include higher net income, a reduction in working capital and a nonrepeat of front-half-loaded cash expenses. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $810 million worth of common shares outstanding. 
Now for the outlook. Let's begin with Display and the display market. For the full year, our view of end market and glass market growth is unchanged. While there are puts and takes by region, we continue to expect worldwide TV unit growth of 2% and screen size to increase by more than 1.5 inches. 
As I already mentioned, the outlook for handheld and IT market is lower than our prior expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Therefore, in total for the year, we still expect the overall retail market in square feet to be up 8% to 10%, and we continue to expect the overall glass market in terms of area to be up in the mid-single digits. The first quarter supply chain inventory drive-down accounts for the difference. 
Turning to our third quarter. We're seeing healthy supply chain inventory. Panel makers' inventory is lean, and they are further increasing utilization to meet increased demands from set makers.  
As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digit sequentially in the third quarter. We also expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially, consistent with Q2. As we have previously explained, we will maintain our stable share strategy and align our operating capacity with market demand, and we continue to expect the more favorable pricing environment will continue or possibly improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization, end-market demand and other market factors very closely, and all indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year, especially in the large Gen sizes as a result of strong TV demand. 
Second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though price declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has declined during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable.  For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward. 
Moving to Optical Communications. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 10% versus last year, driven by growth in fiber-to-the-home and data centers. 
Turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect weakness in the heavy-duty truck markets in North America and China to continue. We expect third quarter Environmental sales to be down slightly year-over-year, driven by foreign exchange. 
In Specialty Materials, we expect sales to be consistent with Q3 last year. This is an 8% up sequentially, driven mainly by volume growth of Gorilla Glass in preparation for new product launches later this year. 
And for the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market for '16 has weakened, which impacts sales of Gorilla Glass. As a result, we now expect that sales in Specialty Materials will be consistent or down slightly from last year, but will be up sequentially each quarter.  In Life Sciences, we expect Q3 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite a drag from our foreign exchange. 
Turning to the consolidated outlook. We expect the gross margin to be approximately 43% and consistent with Q2. Most margins expand versus last year with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. 
SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 7% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $60 million. We expect Q3 total gross equity earnings to be approximately $15 million. As a reminder, we no longer have silicones' equity earnings. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 15% to 16% range. 
Now, that concludes our outlook for the third quarter. Let me close by saying that we are pleased with the strong sequential growth in sales and earnings in the second quarter. We are confident that Corning's performance will continue to improve with year-over-year sales and EPS growth in both the third and fourth quarters, and we look forward to delivering on our long-term commitments to create strong value. We expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders. We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the of cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition, and we have a rich set of growth opportunities.

So now, then, you start where do our strategies sort of begin to impact our revenue realization in that slower-growth market as well as what will be the next sort of uptick in the market, one way or the other. So let's deal with the second first. Uptick in the market, for us, it really does get driven by how exciting the product our customers come out with and its impact on consumers. So I can't give much insight into that for you, but we do believe that we see some pretty exciting products coming that should help on the total market growth. Now then, let's take a look at us in a more micro way. We would normally expect that we're going to grow faster than the market and that, that is because of our superior product, we should be always in any sort of share-gaining mode; as well as that as we introduce higher value-add products, we'll get higher revenue per device. I think, this year, we have an interesting dynamic in that customer mix can really make an impact. We have some customers where we do virtually all of their cover class needs and some where we just do the majority. So which customer gets impacted can impact us a little more outsized when you're dealing with the slower-growth market. And then second has just been timing on adoption of some of the higher value-add products and our ability to manufacture. A good example of this is Phire, where we continue to get pretty good pull on Phire, especially for wearables, but the difficulty of that manufacturing process has pushed us a little bit out in time versus our original launch dates. But overall, we would look over the long term for this business for us to continue to have pretty robust growth and to be able, over that 4-year time frame, to double our revenue on this overall platform. It also includes things like augmented reality, but more on that to come in the future."

So I guess my question to Tony is, can you walk us through, outside of the Optical Communications volumes, what drove gross margin to rebound? And based on the guidance of sustaining this level of 43% and if we take maybe an intermediate to longer-term view, are we at a point where Corning's gross margins should be stable to having upward trajectory from current levels?"

One was the Optical Communications' improvement both in terms of sales, but the amount of money that we were spending on our software project issue also reduced during the quarter. There's a lot of onetime manufacturing inefficiencies that got better in the second quarter. That helped us. And the fact that we also had volume growth up in the high single digits on Display also helped us considerably, and that's how we ended with the 43%. When you look out into Q3, we expect to see growth. We see some of it in Optical Communications and some of it in Display and Specialty Materials. And when you average those out, keeping in mind that Optical Communications' gross margins are lower than the corporate average and the others' are higher, we end up back at that 43% level. As you look forward, it obviously is going to depend on where the mix of our businesses are.

And we expect that TV units are going to speed up 2% on a year-over-year basis. As we go through the year, we've seen some stronger demand than what we expected, in particular in North America but also in Europe. But there have been some areas that have been weaker, like in Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and also Japan has been a little bit weaker. When you net that out, it comes back to that 2%. And the other really important factor is what happens with screen size, and from a screen-size standpoint, we're looking at screen size growth greater than 1.5 inch. So when you add all that together, even though it's a little bit weaker on the other mobile consumer electronics products, that still puts us in that 8% to 10% range."

You noted how Gorilla Glass 4 mix is actually helping your profitably now. Can you sort of talk about how that mix plays out in terms of where you are as a percentage; or maybe shipments, roughly; and then how Gorilla 5 sort of impacts that mix maybe over the next few quarters; and also the profits going forward? And then secondly, Tony, just -- I know you mentioned that the cash flows are back-end-loaded for the year, but are we still looking at similar expectations as to what you were thinking a year -- a quarter ago or the analyst meeting for cash flow from operations around $3 billion? Or is that maybe a little lighter now?"

If you think about what drives our cash flow, we do have a onetime payment that -- a legal settlement that wouldn't have been in those projections originally. And then, of course, the other big factor is where income actually ends up on a year-over-year basis, and our first quarter was obviously softer than what we originally projected. But it's still going to be quite strong. It's still going to be well closer to $3 billion than it would be to, say, $2.5 billion."

So let me describe in at a little broader sense rather than give you my direct answer about what we're trying to do. So the market has a certain dynamic in that how do our customers want to position themselves relative to consumers. And so that's why we have open to us different products at different price points. So the way Gorilla Glass 3 plays out is we really sort of aim out at those of our customers who are seeking to get benefits of Gorilla relative to soda lime or other aluminosilicate providers but are highly price-sensitive. And so the more of that we gain, that's all great because, as you know, the margins of Gorilla are terrific, right? But that price will be moving direct in response to competitors. GG4, GG5, what we're seeking to do there is for those of our customers who want to use -- create absolute premium products that are as thin as can be and as damage-resistant as can be, they're willing to pay for that innovation. And therefore, we introduce those products at a premium. Our overall desire is that, overall, we can continue to push down the cost of Gorilla, while having the price on average, so to not fall so much. And that's exactly what we're trying to do in increasing sort of our -- one piece of increasing our revenue per device. Now, why the folks don't want us to give guidance on anything like that is back to the customer mix question that I addressed before. Now, which customer does what starts to get really important if you're trying to pick from your gross margin model, how everything's going to work out. And in a market that's already pretty tough to predict given how the value chain moves, that added degree of complexity won't make us too accurate. But that -- you're on exactly what it is we're trying to do, and then it'll be a mix of how much value-type brands go in a certain quarter versus sort of premium-cycle upgrade to the new glass. That makes sense, Steven?"

We've got to, obviously, answer this based on our analysis of the situation, and we do recognize that the yen fluctuates and that will impact both glass procurement costs for our customers. And they buy glass in yen; they sell the panels in dollars. And we also know that our competitors, the Japanese glassmakers, could also get a temporary translation benefit when the yen strengthens or, of course, a temporary loss when it weakens against the currencies of the countries they manufacture. But we don't think this is going to be a big impact. The effect on customers is not as big as it used to be. Glass used to be 15% to 20% of the customer material cost; it's now only about 8%. And then the second factor was our competitors are not as profitable as they used to be, and any benefit they get from yen appreciation may only be temporary. So for these reasons, we don't expect to see a meaningful pricing impact, a result of the yen movement. And the perfect example of that's what happened in Q2, where the yen strengthened considerably but price declines were moderate. So we don't believe this is going to have a big impact, but we recognize there's a couple of areas where we need to -- that we are obviously monitoring it."

So in macro, basically when we talk about OLED, you're only really talking about consumer -- mobile consumer electronics, right, really phone-type business, which is a relatively small, right, really small like under a single-digit percent sort of small, sort of percent of where sort of glass changes in total. Now -- and overall, I think all the adjudication of large-size OLED versus large-size LCD, LCD continues to just get stronger and stronger relative. So all we're talking about is that piece. Now, there have been rumors about one of our major customers taking some of their capacity that currently makes LCD, large size, and take that same plant and make more of the small-size polyimide OLED. We can't comment on is that true or not, but let's deal with it in a more theoretical way. So here is what happens. What sets the overall glass demand is going to be: What happens in the market? Which customer of ours makes it, okay? Does it impact? Is the glass demand there or not? In micro, we have some customers where we have incredibly high share and some customers where we have more moderate share. So what we would expect overall, though, is that we pick up what our average share is of whatever that market is. So we don't expect that to be a really big market shift for us. And then, in specific for us on polyimide OLED is demand there net increases demand on us for glass because our relative share there is very, very high and our relative share in the displays it is replacing, which is basically low-temperature polysilicon displays for phones, is lower. So I think overall,  though you can get some temporal impact, I'm not looking at that as being as huge driver. Makes sense?"

But whether or not you thought TV units were going to be up 1%, up 2% or even relatively flat, that you can remember, I think we actually showed it to you on this slide on the 2016 outlook when Tony was going through his talk, that TV units up about 2% would be a growth contribution in glass area by about 2%. But the screen size being greater, up greater than 1.5 inches, that's driving 5% to 6% growth. And so what we're hearing sort of from the market is, yes, television unit growth may be a little bit softer than what we would have thought in the very beginning of the year, but actually like the previous question, screen size is maybe a little bit bigger than what we thought, so it's pushing us in those ranges. But it could be very legitimate that rather than coming in around 2, it comes in around 1. I mean, all that's within the range of possibility, and that's why we try to give you sort of an idea of how to factor the various pieces so you can plug in what it is your opinion is and then sort of figure out from that what's going to happen in glass demand. And then, the final piece is value chain adjustments are even going to be bigger than that television unit piece. And that's how we all end up at the bottom line at sort of the mid-single digits in square footage growth for us, for the market, and I think that's okay. Oh, Iris, right. So Iris is continuing to get some really good commercial transaction with -- now we're up to a number of customers that are really evaluating it very strongly and some are choosing to launch with it, right? It's still early days. It's -- many of you may have heard me speak, I tend to think about disruptive innovations like this because it's highly disruptive. You're displacing an incumbent technology of PMMA with a brand new material set to be able to make televisions thinner and with smaller bezels. That -- it tends to go in phases. You've got to kind of go from the idea, then you get a breakthrough, and then if it's really good, you can get a breakout and then you have to defend your really strong position. I'm getting increasingly confident we're going to have a breakthrough. It's going to penetrate large, edge-lit TVs, and it's going to have a meaningful penetration into that. Now, whether or not we got to break out and this becomes a really dominant technology choice for edge-lit, it's just too early to tell. But the good news is, the increased commercial transaction is increasing our confidence that you're going to start to see some multiple sets introduced using this technology, and we're going to penetrate the market some. But for it to be significant, we still got a ways to go."

Sales and gross margins increased in every business segment year-over-year. We also grew the company sales, net income and EPS both sequentially and year-over-year. Core EPS was $0.42, up 14% sequentially and 24% year-over-year.
On earlier calls, we told you that we expected our momentum to build steadily throughout 2016, and it has. For the fourth quarter, we expect again to see year-over-year growth in sales, net income and EPS. Our operating results and our progress on key growth initiatives continue to reinforce our confidence in Corning's strategy.
On our earnings call 1 year ago, we introduced our strategy and capital allocation framework. We designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. The framework includes a commitment to delivering at least $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities through 2019.
As a reminder, we focus 80% of our portfolio on 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We believe that this focus reduces the cost of innovation, increases our likelihood of success and attracts some of the world's leading companies to our ecosystem because they see how our unique expertise can help address some of their toughest challenges.
We are very pleased with the progress on our framework. Since its introduction a year ago, we've gained traction with our customers on our growth initiatives, realigned our interest in Dow Corning and are on track to distribute $6 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016.
Achievements on the framework this quarter include the launch of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which we expect to conclude in the fourth [ph] quarter, significant new product introductions and progress on several of our new growth initiatives. Let's look at a few of those.
In our mobile consumer electronics market access platform, our goal is to double sales despite the maturing of the IT and handheld markets. We do this primarily by introducing products advance the state of the art. This allows us to capture a price premium and to win in new places, like wearables and phone backs. We introduced 2 of these innovative products during the third quarter: Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+.
Gorilla Glass 5 has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We are seeing superior drop performance translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and the opportunity to expand the use of Gorilla. Given the drop performance is the #1 want from consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We are very pleased with the rate of adoption in just 3 months. 
Next, Gorilla Glass SR+ delivers an unparalleled combination of toughness, scratch resistance and optical clarity for today's wearable devices. You'll find SR+ on the Samsung Gear 3 later this year.
In our automotive market access platform, we seek to build a gorilla-sized automotive glass business and also to create a significant new business around gas particulate filters. 
Let's start with the automotive glass opportunity, where our excitement continues to grow. Previously, we focused most of our commentary on the advantages of Gorilla Glass for car windows, but designers of connected and autonomous vehicles are likely to dramatically increase the use of glass in touchscreens in auto interiors. Gorilla Glass provides a unique path to deliver curved designs cost effectively and creates a great new opportunity for us. Examples were featured recently at the Paris auto show inside the Renault Trezor concept car and also at the Faurecia booth in a curved full-glass center console called Smart Pebbles. 
Both OEMs promoted their use of ""Ultra Tough Corning Gorilla Glass,"" and received significant media coverage. A reporter commented that the Trezor's dashboard is a big curved OLED display made from Gorilla Glass that controls most car functions and possesses a design DNA that will be passed on to the French automakers' future models.
Moving to gas particulate covers or GPS. You've seen major car manufacturers announce that they will equip vehicles with GPS to meet the Euro 6 regulation. We've won the majority of platforms awarded to date, and we expect sales to begin ramping in 2017. As a reminder, no GPS are used in commercially available vehicles today. 
Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe that GPS will be required to control particulate emissions from gasoline direct-injection engines. GDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy, and as a result, have grown to about 1/4 of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high teens annually. 
We expect gas-particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. They offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of 3 to 4 with profitability similar to our current business. Today, sales of GPS are insignificant. However, in line with our commitment to invest $10 billion in growth opportunities, our investment on GPS is ramping in tandem with customer commitments. So you will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term as we seek to build another significant business within our automotive market access platform.
In our optical communications market access platform, our goal is to grow at least twice as fast as telecom industry CapEx. We plan to do this by focusing on high-growth segments and by delivering integrated solutions that offer new levels of performance and reduce our customers' costs.
Optical Communications is now a fully evolved example of our focused 3-4-5 portfolio. We began more than 40 years ago by leveraging our deep knowledge of optical physics, glass science and vapor deposition to disrupt the telecommunications industry with optical fiber. Over time, we increased our value-add by leveraging ceramics, extrusion and precision forming. We're now working with customers on glass motherboards based on our fusion platform. Today, we are reaping the benefits of this unique combination of capabilities in segments like fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.
We're also seeing the benefits of our approach in the wireless arena. For example, in August, the Atlanta Falcon's Chief Technology Officer announced that Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium will use the Corning ONE platform as a single optical network core that integrates Wi-Fi, cellular and video. We will be providing 4,000 miles of optical cable and 1,400 Wi-Fi access points. 
Now what gets me excited about wins like this is not the size, which is certainly impressive, but instead, it's that the skill sets underlying the Corning ONE platform are directly applicable to the emerging opportunities in 5G wireless. And more to come on innovations in this space.
In summary, under the strategy and capital allocation framework, we are utilizing our financial strength both to return capital to shareholders and also to invest in growth through research and development, capital expansion and M&A.
Since we introduced the framework a year ago, we have returned a total of $5.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks, reducing outstanding shares by about 18% and increasing the dividend by 12.5%. We believe that our investments will allow us to deliver secular growth over the long term while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders.
Tony will now provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Tony?"
173840,403634037,1059918,"Corning Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q3 core results reflected the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected. We were very pleased with our strong operating performance. Sales and gross margins were u",1983,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q3 core results reflected the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected. We were very pleased with our strong operating performance. Sales and gross margins were up in every segment year-over-year, and our net income and earnings per share were up significantly. Looking ahead, we see year-over-year sales, net income and EPS growth in the fourth quarter.
Before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the third quarter is, again, a noncash mark-to-market loss. 
As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts, settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter even though those contracts will not settle in the current quarter. 
Consequently in this quarter, we marked our contracts to market again, as required by GAAP, resulting in a GAAP loss of $150 million. The loss in this quarter was significantly smaller than we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year because the yen exchange rates moved less. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have received cash totaling $1.2 billion under hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the currency-related decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
At present, we have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per $1. For investors who are concerned that a weakening yen would negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.
Now for investors who have additional questions, please refer to the more extensive discussion in our first and second quarter conference call or in the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.
Now let's turn to the results for the third quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics.
Sales in the quarter were $2.55 billion, up 4% versus last year and exceeding our expectations. The growth was driven largely by strong performance in Optical Communications. 
Corporate gross margin was 43%, on track with guidance and well ahead of last year. The year-over-year improvement largely reflected improved profitability in Optical Communications and good cost performance in Display.
SG&A was 13% of sales at $328 million. RD&E cost were 7% of sales at $187 million. Total gross equity earnings were $19 million. Recall, we closed on the realignment of Dow Corning on May 31, so third quarter equity earnings predominantly reflect our equity earnings from Hemlock. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. 
Net income was $466 million, up 7% sequentially and 4% from last year's third quarter. Adjusting for the former Dow Corning silicones business equity earnings which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 16% on the 4% sales growth. This reflects our strong underlying financial performance.
EPS was $0.42, up 24% versus last year and above expectations.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of common shares outstanding. And adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $721 million, up significantly over Q1 and Q2, as expected, and driven primarily by higher core net income.
Now consistent with history, we expect Q4 operating cash flow to be up sequentially. We expect the increase to be driven primarily by a reduction in working capital and other cash receipts.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and the outlook for each business, beginning with Display Technologies.
Display had a very strong third quarter, exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the 2016 glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digits for the full year. As you would expect, there are a few puts and takes at retail versus our expectations, but the biggest driver of the growth remains TV screen size, which is tracking solidly to be more than 1.5 inches of year-over-year growth.
In the third quarter, the set makers pulled very hard for panels ahead of the Q4 peak retail season. Our customers, the Panel Makers, increased their utilizations to meet this demand, which resulted in additional sequential growth for the glass market. The glass market was up high single digits sequentially versus our expectations that the glass market would be up mid-single digits sequentially. Our glass volume was up slightly more than the glass market due to customer mix. For the 9th consecutive quarter, the decline in LCD glass pricing remained moderate and met the expectations we noted last quarter.
These drivers produced the strong results for our Display business in the third quarter, with sales up 7% and net income up 14% sequentially. And forward-looking weeks of supply chain inventory remained at a healthy level and Panel Maker inventories remain lean.
As I already said, we expect the 2016 glass market and our volume will be up mid-single digits for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect Panel Maker utilization to remain high and glass supply to remain tight, so we could see Q4 glass volume consistent with Q3. But in light of the third quarter upside, it only follows that our fourth quarter volume may be down slightly. Therefore, while our overall guidance for the year remains unchanged, our guidance for the fourth quarter glass volume is consistent to down slightly sequentially, and we will watch this closely as the quarter unfolds.
In the fourth quarter, we expect LCD glass prices to decline moderately and be more moderate than Q3. And we expect that the moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 9 quarters will continue or even improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization and market demand and other market factors very closely, and all of those indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year and into 2017, especially in large gen sizes as the result of the strong TV demand. We will manage our operating capacity to our demand and maintain our stable share strategy. 
And second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though prices declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has remained low during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow down further as they try to remain profitable. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Overall, we are pleased with the growth in Optical Communications in the third quarter and expect strong growth again in Q4. Third quarter sales were $795 million, up 6% versus last year, with fiber-to-the-home very strong.
While our growth in Optical Communications was strong on an absolute basis, we missed our own guidance because growth in hyperscale data center projects was below expectations. Note that our sales for a large hyperscale data center range from $5 million to $10 million, so delay of a single project can reduce total segment growth by more than 1 percentage point. We remain well-positioned to capture secular long-term growth in the hyperscale segment.
Net income at $98 million was up 38% over last year. Improved manufacturing cost and favorable shift toward sales of our solution products contributed to the higher year-over-year profitability.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow in the high single digits year-over-year, led by continued fiber-to-the-home strength. We expect hyperscale sales to continue growing faster than overall Optical Communications segment, but at a rate lower than we anticipated earlier in the year. 
In Environmental, Q3 sales were up 3% versus last year and slightly ahead of expectations. Sales of light-duty substrates for auto were a record up 17% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand in North America, Europe and China and additional platform wins. This strength was offset by continued weakness for heavy-duty products in North America and China. Note, we expect the market for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be down 30% this year.
Net income declined $3 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down low single digits versus Q4 last year as weakness continues in the heavy-duty truck markets.
Let's move to Specialty Materials, where both sales and net income were ahead of our expectations. Year-over-year, Q3 sales increased 2% and net income was consistent. Compared to the second quarter, Q3 sales grew 11%, while net income was impacted by ramp-up costs associated with the launch of new products and customer mix. With the majority of the launch spend behind us, we expect fourth quarter profitability to improve.
Earlier, Wendell noted that we introduced Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+ in the third quarter. Just last week, Chinese OEM Oppo announced Gorilla Glass 5 on its R9s and R9s Plus smartphones. And you can expect to see them on additional devices in the coming months.
Volume growth of Gorilla Glass is expected to drive the high single-digit year-over-year sales growth we expect for the segment in the fourth quarter.
In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were $214 million and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million. And we expect Q4 sales to be up low single digits versus last year. 
Now I'll cover additional items in our fourth quarter outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect our fourth quarter gross margins to be consistent with Q3 at 43%, which is up 1 percentage point from last year's fourth quarter. Our view reflects the higher sales we expect in Optical Communications and year-over-year cost reductions in Display. SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million.
Now we expect total gross equity earnings to be between $75 million and $85 million. This is higher than some analysts were modeling, driven by higher sales from Hemlock's solar business, as customers complete their annual contract commitments. Versus last year, Hemlock's contributions to our net income is expected to be up $10 million to $15 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 15%.
Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with the strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and earnings in the third quarter, and we expect similarly strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. 
Other than Optical Communications, all of our businesses met or exceeded expectations. While we do not expect Optical Communications to grow quite as fast as our prior guidance for the back half of the year, we are still delighted with high single-digit growth and believe that we remain well-positioned to continue growing more than twice the rate of the overall telecom industry.
Stepping back, our performance demonstrates the benefits of the strategy in capital allocation framework introduced last fall. Under that framework, we expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders, and we will have returned $6 billion by year-end. 
We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition. And we have a rich set of growth opportunities. Overall, we feel very good about where we are. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

Is in those areas, where you want very intense and high bandwidth and low latency applications, so that tends to be where you bring an awful lot of users together in one area. So that's been the focus of our development, because we think if you look longer term in wireless and longer term in things like 5G, the critical thing to drive new application will be that combination of high bandwidth and low latency. Those are the aps [ph] that get exciting. And that's what shapes our efforts in wireless to not be a new 2 [ph] player, but instead, set a platform that would have real legs over time.

Sales and gross margins increased in every business segment year-over-year. We also grew the company sales, net income and EPS both sequentially and year-over-year. Core EPS was $0.42, up 14% sequentially and 24% year-over-year.
On earlier calls, we told you that we expected our momentum to build steadily throughout 2016, and it has. For the fourth quarter, we expect again to see year-over-year growth in sales, net income and EPS. Our operating results and our progress on key growth initiatives continue to reinforce our confidence in Corning's strategy.
On our earnings call 1 year ago, we introduced our strategy and capital allocation framework. We designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. The framework includes a commitment to delivering at least $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities through 2019.
As a reminder, we focus 80% of our portfolio on 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We believe that this focus reduces the cost of innovation, increases our likelihood of success and attracts some of the world's leading companies to our ecosystem because they see how our unique expertise can help address some of their toughest challenges.
We are very pleased with the progress on our framework. Since its introduction a year ago, we've gained traction with our customers on our growth initiatives, realigned our interest in Dow Corning and are on track to distribute $6 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016.
Achievements on the framework this quarter include the launch of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which we expect to conclude in the fourth quarter, significant new product introductions and progress on several of our new growth initiatives. Let's look at a few of those.
In our mobile consumer electronics market access platform, our goal is to double sales despite the maturing of the IT and handheld markets. We do this primarily by introducing products advance the state of the art. This allows us to capture a price premium and to win in new places, like wearables and phone backs. We introduced 2 of these innovative products during the third quarter: Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+.
Gorilla Glass 5 has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We are seeing superior drop performance translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and the opportunity to expand the use of Gorilla. Given the drop performance is the #1 want from consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We are very pleased with the rate of adoption in just 3 months. 
Next, Gorilla Glass SR+ delivers an unparalleled combination of toughness, scratch resistance and optical clarity for today's wearable devices. You'll find SR+ on the Samsung Gear 3 later this year.
In our automotive market access platform, we seek to build a gorilla-sized automotive glass business and also to create a significant new business around gas particulate filters. 
Let's start with the automotive glass opportunity, where our excitement continues to grow. Previously, we focused most of our commentary on the advantages of Gorilla Glass for car windows, but designers of connected and autonomous vehicles are likely to dramatically increase the use of glass in touchscreens in auto interiors. Gorilla Glass provides a unique path to deliver curved designs cost effectively and creates a great new opportunity for us. Examples were featured recently at the Paris auto show inside the Renault Trezor concept car and also at the Faurecia booth in a curved full-glass center console called Smart Pebbles. 
Both OEMs promoted their use of ""Ultra Tough Corning Gorilla Glass,"" and received significant media coverage. A reporter commented that the Trezor's dashboard is a big curved OLED display made from Gorilla Glass that controls most car functions and possesses a design DNA that will be passed on to the French automakers' future models.
Moving to gas particulate covers or GPS. You've seen major car manufacturers announce that they will equip vehicles with GPS to meet the Euro 6 regulation. We've won the majority of platforms awarded to date, and we expect sales to begin ramping in 2017. As a reminder, no GPS are used in commercially available vehicles today. 
Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe that GPS will be required to control particulate emissions from gasoline direct-injection engines. GDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy, and as a result, have grown to about 1/4 of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high teens annually. 
We expect gas-particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. They offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of 3 to 4 with profitability similar to our current business. Today, sales of GPS are insignificant. However, in line with our commitment to invest $10 billion in growth opportunities, our investment on GPS is ramping in tandem with customer commitments. So you will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term as we seek to build another significant business within our automotive market access platform.
In our optical communications market access platform, our goal is to grow at least twice as fast as telecom industry CapEx. We plan to do this by focusing on high-growth segments and by delivering integrated solutions that offer new levels of performance and reduce our customers' costs.
Optical Communications is now a fully evolved example of our focused 3-4-5 portfolio. We began more than 40 years ago by leveraging our deep knowledge of optical physics, glass science and vapor deposition to disrupt the telecommunications industry with optical fiber. Over time, we increased our value-add by leveraging ceramics, extrusion and precision forming. We're now working with customers on glass motherboards based on our fusion platform. Today, we are reaping the benefits of this unique combination of capabilities in segments like fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.
We're also seeing the benefits of our approach in the wireless arena. For example, in August, the Atlanta Falcon's Chief Technology Officer announced that Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium will use the Corning ONE platform as a single optical network core that integrates WiFi, cellular and video. We will be providing 4,000 miles of optical cable and 1,400 WiFi access points. 
Now what gets me excited about wins like this is not the size, which is certainly impressive, but instead, it's that the skill sets underlying the Corning ONE platform are directly applicable to the emerging opportunities in 5G wireless. And more to come on innovations in this space.
In summary, under the strategy and capital allocation framework, we are utilizing our financial strength both to return capital to shareholders and also to invest in growth through research and development, capital expansion and M&A.
Since we introduced the framework a year ago, we have returned a total of $5.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks, reducing outstanding shares by about 18% and increasing the dividend by 12.5%. We believe that our investments will allow us to deliver secular growth over the long term while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders.
Tony will now provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Tony?"

As we noted in today's press release, our Q3 core results reflected the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected. We were very pleased with our strong operating performance. Sales and gross margins were up in every segment year-over-year, and our net income and earnings per share were up significantly. Looking ahead, we see year-over-year sales, net income and EPS growth in the fourth quarter.
Before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the third quarter is, again, a noncash mark-to-market loss. 
As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts, settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter even though those contracts will not settle in the current quarter. 
Consequently in this quarter, we marked our contracts to market again, as required by GAAP, resulting in a GAAP loss of $150 million. The loss in this quarter was significantly smaller than we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year because the yen exchange rates moved less. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have received cash totaling $1.2 billion under hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the currency-related decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
At present, we have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per $1. For investors who are concerned that a weakening yen would negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.
Now for investors who have additional questions, please refer to the more extensive discussion in our first and second quarter conference call or in the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.
Now let's turn to the results for the third quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics.
Sales in the quarter were $2.55 billion, up 4% versus last year and exceeding our expectations. The growth was driven largely by strong performance in Optical Communications. 
Corporate gross margin was 43%, on track with guidance and well ahead of last year. The year-over-year improvement largely reflected improved profitability in Optical Communications and good cost performance in Display.
SG&A was 13% of sales at $328 million. RD&E cost were 7% of sales at $187 million. Total gross equity earnings were $19 million. Recall, we closed on the realignment of Dow Corning on May 31, so third quarter equity earnings predominantly reflect our equity earnings from Hemlock. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. 
Net income was $466 million, up 7% sequentially and 4% from last year's third quarter. Adjusting for the former Dow Corning silicones business equity earnings which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 16% on the 4% sales growth. This reflects our strong underlying financial performance.
EPS was $0.42, up 24% versus last year and above expectations.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of common shares outstanding. And adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $721 million, up significantly over Q1 and Q2, as expected, and driven primarily by higher core net income.
Now consistent with history, we expect Q4 operating cash flow to be up sequentially. We expect the increase to be driven primarily by a reduction in working capital and other cash receipts.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and the outlook for each business, beginning with Display Technologies.
Display had a very strong third quarter, exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the 2016 glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digits for the full year. As you would expect, there are a few puts and takes at retail versus our expectations, but the biggest driver of the growth remains TV screen size, which is tracking solidly to be more than 1.5 inches of year-over-year growth.
In the third quarter, the set makers pulled very hard for panels ahead of the Q4 peak retail season. Our customers, the Panel Makers, increased their utilizations to meet this demand, which resulted in additional sequential growth for the glass market. The glass market was up high single digits sequentially versus our expectations that the glass market would be up mid-single digits sequentially. Our glass volume was up slightly more than the glass market due to customer mix. For the 9th consecutive quarter, the decline in LCD glass pricing remained moderate and met the expectations we noted last quarter.
These drivers produced the strong results for our Display business in the third quarter, with sales up 7% and net income up 14% sequentially. And forward-looking weeks of supply chain inventory remained at a healthy level and Panel Maker inventories remain lean.
As I already said, we expect the 2016 glass market and our volume will be up mid-single digits for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect Panel Maker utilization to remain high and glass supply to remain tight, so we could see Q4 glass volume consistent with Q3. But in light of the third quarter upside, it only follows that our fourth quarter volume may be down slightly. Therefore, while our overall guidance for the year remains unchanged, our guidance for the fourth quarter glass volume is consistent to down slightly sequentially, and we will watch this closely as the quarter unfolds.
In the fourth quarter, we expect LCD glass prices to decline moderately and be more moderate than Q3. And we expect that the moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 9 quarters will continue or even improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization and market demand and other market factors very closely, and all of those indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year and into 2017, especially in large gen sizes as the result of the strong TV demand. We will manage our operating capacity to our demand and maintain our stable share strategy. 
And second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though prices declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has remained low during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow down further as they try to remain profitable. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Overall, we are pleased with the growth in Optical Communications in the third quarter and expect strong growth again in Q4. Third quarter sales were $795 million, up 6% versus last year, with fiber-to-the-home very strong.
While our growth in Optical Communications was strong on an absolute basis, we missed our own guidance because growth in hyperscale data center projects was below expectations. Note that our sales for a large hyperscale data center range from $5 million to $10 million, so delay of a single project can reduce total segment growth by more than 1 percentage point. We remain well-positioned to capture secular long-term growth in the hyperscale segment.
Net income at $98 million was up 38% over last year. Improved manufacturing cost and favorable shift toward sales of our solution products contributed to the higher year-over-year profitability.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow in the high single digits year-over-year, led by continued fiber-to-the-home strength. We expect hyperscale sales to continue growing faster than overall Optical Communications segment, but at a rate lower than we anticipated earlier in the year. 
In Environmental, Q3 sales were up 3% versus last year and slightly ahead of expectations. Sales of light-duty substrates for auto were a record up 17% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand in North America, Europe and China and additional platform wins. This strength was offset by continued weakness for heavy-duty products in North America and China. Note, we expect the market for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be down 30% this year.
Net income declined $3 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down low single digits versus Q4 last year as weakness continues in the heavy-duty truck markets.
Let's move to Specialty Materials, where both sales and net income were ahead of our expectations. Year-over-year, Q3 sales increased 2% and net income was consistent. Compared to the second quarter, Q3 sales grew 11%, while net income was impacted by ramp-up costs associated with the launch of new products and customer mix. With the majority of the launch spend behind us, we expect fourth quarter profitability to improve.
Earlier, Wendell noted that we introduced Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+ in the third quarter. Just last week, Chinese OEM Oppo announced Gorilla Glass 5 on its R9s and R9s Plus smartphones. And you can expect to see them on additional devices in the coming months.
Volume growth of Gorilla Glass is expected to drive the high single-digit year-over-year sales growth we expect for the segment in the fourth quarter.
In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were $214 million and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million. And we expect Q4 sales to be up low single digits versus last year. 
Now I'll cover additional items in our fourth quarter outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect our fourth quarter gross margins to be consistent with Q3 at 43%, which is up 1 percentage point from last year's fourth quarter. Our view reflects the higher sales we expect in Optical Communications and year-over-year cost reductions in Display. SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million.
Now we expect total gross equity earnings to be between $75 million and $85 million. This is higher than some analysts were modeling, driven by higher sales from Hemlock's solar business, as customers complete their annual contract commitments. Versus last year, Hemlock's contributions to our net income is expected to be up $10 million to $15 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 15%.
Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with the strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and earnings in the third quarter, and we expect similarly strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. 
Other than Optical Communications, all of our businesses met or exceeded expectations. While we do not expect Optical Communications to grow quite as fast as our prior guidance for the back half of the year, we are still delighted with high single-digit growth and believe that we remain well-positioned to continue growing more than twice the rate of the overall telecom industry.
Stepping back, our performance demonstrates the benefits of the strategy in capital allocation framework introduced last fall. Under that framework, we expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders, and we will have returned $6 billion by year-end. 
We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition. And we have a rich set of growth opportunities. Overall, we feel very good about where we are. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

Sales and gross margins increased in every business segment year-over-year. We also grew the company's sales, net income and EPS both sequentially and year-over-year. Core EPS was $0.42, up 14% sequentially and 24% year-over-year.
On earlier calls, we told you that we expected our momentum to build steadily throughout 2016, and it has. For the fourth quarter, we expect again to see year-over-year growth in sales, net income and EPS. Our operating results and our progress on key growth initiatives continue to reinforce our confidence in Corning's strategy.
On our earnings call a year ago, we introduced our strategy and capital allocation framework. We designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. The framework includes a commitment to delivering at least $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities through 2019.
As a reminder, we focus 80% of our portfolio on 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We believe that this focus reduces the cost of innovation, increases our likelihood of success and attracts some of the world's leading companies to our ecosystem because they see how our unique expertise can help address some of their toughest challenges.
We are very pleased with the progress on our framework. Since its introduction a year ago, we've gained traction with our customers on our growth initiatives, realigned our interest in Dow Corning and are on track to distribute $6 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016.
Achievements on the framework this quarter include the launch of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which we expect to conclude in the fourth quarter, significant new product introductions and progress on several of our new growth initiatives. Let's look at a few examples.
In our mobile consumer electronics market access platform, our goal is to double sales despite the maturing of the IT and handheld markets. We do this primarily by introducing products that advance the state of the art. This allows us to capture a price premium and to win in new places, like wearables and phone backs. We introduced 2 of these innovative products during the third quarter: Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+.
Gorilla Glass 5 has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We are seeing superior drop performance translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and the opportunity to expand the use of Gorilla. Given that drop performance is the #1 want from consumers, it's not surprising the traction at our customers has been strong. We are very pleased with the rate of adoption in just 3 months. 
Next, Gorilla Glass SR+ delivers an unparalleled combination of toughness, scratch resistance and optical clarity for today's wearable devices. You'll find SR+ on the Samsung Gear 3 later this year.
In our automotive market access platform, we seek to build a gorilla-sized automotive glass business and also to create a significant new business around gas particulate filters. 
Let's start with the automotive glass opportunity, where our excitement continues to grow. Previously, we focused most of our commentary on the advantages of Gorilla Glass for car windows. The designers of connected and autonomous vehicles are likely to dramatically increase the use of glass and touchscreens in auto interiors. Gorilla Glass provides a unique path to deliver curved designs cost effectively and creates a great new opportunity for us. Examples were featured recently at the Paris auto show inside the Renault Trezor concept car and also at the Faurecia booth in a curved full-glass center console called Smart Pebbles. 
Both OEMs promoted their use of ""Ultra Tough Corning Gorilla Glass,"" and received significant media coverage. A reporter commented that the Trezor's dashboard is a big curved OLED display made from Gorilla Glass that controls most car functions and possesses a design DNA that will be passed on to the French automakers' future models.
Moving to gas particulate filters, or GPFs. As you've seen major car manufacturers announced that they will equip vehicles with GPFs to meet the Euro 6 regulation. We've won the majority of platforms awarded to date, and we expect sales to begin ramping in 2017. As a reminder, no GPFs are used in commercially available vehicles today. 
Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe that GPFs will be required to control particulate emissions from gasoline direct-injection engines. GDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy, and as a result, have grown to about 1/4 of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high teens annually. 
We expect gas-particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. They offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of 3 to 4, with profitability similar to our current business. Today, sales of GPFs are insignificant. However, in line with our commitment to invest $10 billion in growth opportunities, our investment on GPF is ramping in tandem with customer commitments. So you will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term as we seek to build another significant business within our automotive market access platform.
In our optical communications market access platform, our goal is to grow at least twice as fast as telecom industry CapEx. We plan to do this by focusing on high-growth segments and by delivering integrated solutions that offer new levels of performance and reduce our customers' costs.
Optical Communications is now a fully evolved example of our focused 3-4-5 portfolio. We began more than 40 years ago by leveraging our deep knowledge of optical physics, glass science and vapor deposition to disrupt the telecommunications industry with optical fiber. Over time, we increased our value-add by leveraging ceramics, extrusion and precision forming. We're now working with customers on glass motherboards based on our fusion platform. Today, we are reaping the benefits of this unique combination of capabilities in segments like fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.
We're also seeing the benefits of our approach in the wireless arena. For example, in August, the Atlanta Falcon's Chief Technology Officer announced that Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium will use the Corning ONE platform as a single optical network core that integrates WiFi, cellular and video. We will be providing 4,000 miles of optical cable and 1,400 WiFi access points. 
Now what gets me excited about wins like this is not the size, which is certainly impressive, but instead, it's that the skill sets underlying the Corning ONE platform are directly applicable to the emerging opportunities in 5G wireless. And more to come on innovations in this space.
In summary, under the strategy and capital allocation framework, we are utilizing our financial strength both to return capital to shareholders and also to invest in growth through research and development, capital expansion and M&A.
Since we introduced the framework a year ago, we have returned a total of $5.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks, reducing outstanding shares by about 18% and increasing the dividend by 12.5%. We believe that our investments will allow us to deliver secular growth over the long term while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders.
Tony will now provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Tony?"

Sales and gross margins were up in every segment year-over-year, and our net income and earnings per share were up significantly. Looking ahead, we see year-over-year sales, net income and EPS growth in the fourth quarter.
Before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the third quarter is, again, a noncash mark-to-market loss. 
As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter even though those contracts will not settle in the current quarter. 
Consequently, in this quarter, we marked our contracts to market again, as required by GAAP, resulting in a GAAP loss of $150 million. The loss in this quarter was significantly smaller than we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year because the yen exchange rates moved less. And to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have received cash totaling $1.2 billion under hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the currency-related decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
At present, we have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per $1. For investors who are concerned that a weakening yen would negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.
Now for investors who have additional questions, please refer to the more extensive discussion in our first and second quarter conference call or in the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.
Now let's turn to the results for the third quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics.
Sales in the quarter were $2.55 billion, up 4% versus last year and exceeding our expectations. The growth was driven largely by strong performance in Optical Communications. 
Corporate gross margin was 43%, on track with guidance and well ahead of last year. The year-over-year improvement largely reflected improved profitability in Optical Communications and good cost performance in Display.
SG&A was 13% of sales at $328 million. RD&E costs were 7% of sales at $187 million. Total gross equity earnings were $19 million. Recall, we closed on the realignment of Dow Corning on May 31, so third quarter equity earnings predominantly reflect our equity earnings from Hemlock. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. 
Net income was $466 million, up 7% sequentially and 4% from last year's third quarter. Adjusting for the former Dow Corning silicones business equity earnings, which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 16% on the 4% sales growth. This reflects our strong underlying financial performance.
EPS was $0.42, up 24% versus last year and above expectations.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of common shares outstanding. And adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $721 million, up significantly over Q1 and Q2, as expected, and driven primarily by higher core net income.
Now consistent with history, we expect Q4 operating cash flow to be up sequentially. We expect the increase to be driven primarily by a reduction in working capital and other cash receipts.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and the outlook for each business, beginning with Display Technologies.
Display had a very strong third quarter, exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the 2016 glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digits for the full year. As you would expect, there are a few puts and takes at retail versus our expectations, but the biggest driver of the growth remains TV screen size, which is tracking solidly to be more than 1.5 inches of year-over-year growth.
In the third quarter, the set makers pulled very hard for panels ahead of the Q4 peak retail season. Our customers, the panel makers, increased their utilizations to meet this demand, which resulted in additional sequential growth for the glass market. The glass market was up high single digits sequentially versus our expectations that the glass market would be up mid-single digits sequentially. Our glass volume was up slightly more than the glass market due to customer mix. For the 9th consecutive quarter, the decline in LCD glass pricing remained moderate and met the expectations we noted last quarter.
These drivers produced the strong results for our Display business in the third quarter, with sales up 7% and net income up 14% sequentially. And forward-looking weeks of supply chain inventory remained at a healthy level and panel maker inventories remain lean.
As I already said, we expect the 2016 glass market and our volume will be up mid-single digits for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect panel maker utilization to remain high and glass supply to remain tight, so we could see Q4 glass volume consistent with Q3. But in light of the third quarter upside, it only follows that our fourth quarter volume may be down slightly. Therefore, while our overall guidance for the year remains unchanged, our guidance for the fourth quarter glass volume is consistent to down slightly sequentially, and we will watch this closely as the quarter unfolds.
In the fourth quarter, we expect LCD glass prices to decline moderately and be more moderate than Q3. And we expect that the moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 9 quarters will continue or even improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization and market demand and other market factors very closely, and all of those indicate the glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year and into 2017, especially in large Gen sizes as the result of the strong TV demand. We will manage our operating capacity to our demand and maintain our stable share strategy. 
And second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though prices declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has remained low during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow down further as they try to remain profitable. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Overall, we are pleased with the growth in Optical Communications in the third quarter and expect strong growth again in Q4. Third quarter sales were $795 million, up 6% versus last year, with fiber-to-the-home very strong.
While our growth in Optical Communications was strong on an absolute basis, we missed our own guidance because growth in hyperscale data center projects was below expectations. Note that our sales for a large hyperscale data center range from $5 million to $10 million, so delay of a single project can reduce total segment growth by more than 1 percentage point. We remain well-positioned to capture secular long-term growth in the hyperscale segment.
Net income at $98 million was up 38% over last year. Improved manufacturing costs and favorable shift toward sales of our solution products contributed to the higher year-over-year profitability.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow in the high single digits year-over-year, led by continued fiber-to-the-home strength. We expect hyperscale sales to continue growing faster than the overall Optical Communications segment, but at a rate lower than we anticipated earlier in the year. 
In Environmental, Q3 sales were up 3% versus last year and slightly ahead of expectations. Sales of light-duty substrates for auto were a record, up 17% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand in North America, Europe and China and additional platform wins. This strength was offset by continued weakness for heavy-duty products in North America and China. Note, we expect the market for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be down 30% this year.
Net income declined $3 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down low single digits versus Q4 last year as weakness continues in the heavy-duty truck markets.
Let's move to Specialty Materials, where both sales and net income were ahead of our expectations. Year-over-year, Q3 sales increased 2% and net income was consistent. Compared to the second quarter, Q3 sales grew 11%, while net income was impacted by ramp-up costs associated with the launch of new products and customer mix. With the majority of the launch spend behind us, we expect fourth quarter profitability to improve.
Earlier, Wendell noted that we introduced Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+ in the third quarter. Just last week, Chinese OEM Oppo announced Gorilla Glass 5 on its R9s and R9s Plus smartphones. And you can expect to see them on additional devices in the coming months.
Volume growth in Gorilla Glass is expected to drive the high single-digit year-over-year sales growth we expect for the segment in the fourth quarter.
In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were $214 million and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million. And we expect Q4 sales to be up low single digits versus last year. 
Now I'll cover additional items in our fourth quarter outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect our fourth quarter gross margins to be consistent with Q3 at 43%, which is up 1 percentage point from last year's fourth quarter. Our view reflects the higher sales we expect in Optical Communications and year-over-year cost reductions in Display. SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million.
Now we expect total gross equity earnings to be between $75 million and $85 million. This is higher than some analysts were modeling, driven by higher sales from Hemlock's solar business, as customers complete their annual contract commitments. Versus last year, Hemlock's contributions to our net income is expected to be up $10 million to $15 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 15%.
Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with the strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and earnings in the third quarter, and we expect similarly strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. 
Other than Optical Communications, all of our businesses met or exceeded expectations. While we do not expect Optical Communications to grow quite as fast as our prior guidance for the back half of the year, we are still delighted with high single-digit growth and believe that we remain well positioned to continue growing more than twice the rate of the overall telecom industry.
Stepping back, our performance demonstrates the benefits of the strategy in capital allocation framework introduced last fall. Under that framework, we expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders, and we will have returned $6 billion by year-end. 
We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition. And we have a rich set of growth opportunities. Overall, we feel very good about where we are. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So therefore, arithmetic tells us that we ought to have a little bit lower in Quarter 4. Which of these things being ends up being right, I think, is hard to tell. And that's why you hear our guidance of the sort of flat to down some. If the set makers are right, you'd expect the very strong performance we've seen in quarter 3 to carry forward beautifully into quarter 4. If we're right that the total glass market is what it is we think it is, then arithmetically, there needs to be a correction. Whether it's in quarter 4 of this year or quarter 1 of next, that's hard for us to tell. So I think you read us pretty well. Does that answer that question, Rod?"

As you saw in this morning's press release, we had a great third quarter. Sales and gross margins increased in every business segment year-over-year. We also grew the company's sales, net income and EPS both seque",1249,"Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's press release, we had a great third quarter. 
Sales and gross margins increased in every business segment year-over-year. We also grew the company's sales, net income and EPS both sequentially and year-over-year. Core EPS was $0.42, up 14% sequentially and 24% year-over-year.
On earlier calls, we told you that we expected our momentum to build steadily throughout 2016, and it has. For the fourth quarter, we expect again to see year-over-year growth in sales, net income and EPS. Our operating results and our progress on key growth initiatives continue to reinforce our confidence in Corning's strategy.
On our earnings call a year ago, we introduced our strategy and capital allocation framework. We designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. The framework includes a commitment to delivering at least $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities through 2019.
As a reminder, we focus 80% of our portfolio on 3 core technologies, 4 manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We believe that this focus reduces the cost of innovation, increases our likelihood of success and attracts some of the world's leading companies to our ecosystem because they see how our unique expertise can help address some of their toughest challenges.
We are very pleased with the progress on our framework. Since its introduction a year ago, we've gained traction with our customers on our growth initiatives, realigned our interest in Dow Corning and are on track to distribute $6 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016.
Achievements on the framework this quarter include the launch of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which we expect to conclude in the fourth quarter, significant new product introductions and progress on several of our new growth initiatives. Let's look at a few examples.
In our mobile consumer electronics market access platform, our goal is to double sales despite the maturing of the IT and handheld markets. We do this primarily by introducing products that advance the state of the art. This allows us to capture a price premium and to win in new places, like wearables and phone backs. We introduced 2 of these innovative products during the third quarter: Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+.
Gorilla Glass 5 has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4 and delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We are seeing superior drop performance translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and the opportunity to expand the use of Gorilla. Given that drop performance is the #1 want from consumers, it's not surprising the traction at our customers has been strong. We are very pleased with the rate of adoption in just 3 months. 
Next, Gorilla Glass SR+ delivers an unparalleled combination of toughness, scratch resistance and optical clarity for today's wearable devices. You'll find SR+ on the Samsung Gear 3 later this year.
In our automotive market access platform, we seek to build a gorilla-sized automotive glass business and also to create a significant new business around gas particulate filters. 
Let's start with the automotive glass opportunity, where our excitement continues to grow. Previously, we focused most of our commentary on the advantages of Gorilla Glass for car windows. The designers of connected and autonomous vehicles are likely to dramatically increase the use of glass and touchscreens in auto interiors. Gorilla Glass provides a unique path to deliver curved designs cost effectively and creates a great new opportunity for us. Examples were featured recently at the Paris auto show inside the Renault Trezor concept car and also at the Faurecia booth in a curved full-glass center console called Smart Pebbles. 
Both OEMs promoted their use of ""Ultra Tough Corning Gorilla Glass,"" and received significant media coverage. A reporter commented that the Trezor's dashboard is a big curved OLED display made from Gorilla Glass that controls most car functions and possesses a design DNA that will be passed on to the French automakers' future models.
Moving to gas particulate filters, or GPFs. As you've seen major car manufacturers announced that they will equip vehicles with GPFs to meet the Euro 6 regulation. We've won the majority of platforms awarded to date, and we expect sales to begin ramping in 2017. As a reminder, no GPFs are used in commercially available vehicles today. 
Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe that GPFs will be required to control particulate emissions from gasoline direct-injection engines. GDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy, and as a result, have grown to about 1/4 of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high teens annually. 
We expect gas-particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. They offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of 3 to 4, with profitability similar to our current business. Today, sales of GPFs are insignificant. However, in line with our commitment to invest $10 billion in growth opportunities, our investment on GPF is ramping in tandem with customer commitments. So you will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term as we seek to build another significant business within our automotive market access platform.
In our optical communications market access platform, our goal is to grow at least twice as fast as telecom industry CapEx. We plan to do this by focusing on high-growth segments and by delivering integrated solutions that offer new levels of performance and reduce our customers' costs.
Optical Communications is now a fully evolved example of our focused 3-4-5 portfolio. We began more than 40 years ago by leveraging our deep knowledge of optical physics, glass science and vapor deposition to disrupt the telecommunications industry with optical fiber. Over time, we increased our value-add by leveraging ceramics, extrusion and precision forming. We're now working with customers on glass motherboards based on our fusion platform. Today, we are reaping the benefits of this unique combination of capabilities in segments like fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.
We're also seeing the benefits of our approach in the wireless arena. For example, in August, the Atlanta Falcon's Chief Technology Officer announced that Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium will use the Corning ONE platform as a single optical network core that integrates WiFi, cellular and video. We will be providing 4,000 miles of optical cable and 1,400 WiFi access points. 
Now what gets me excited about wins like this is not the size, which is certainly impressive, but instead, it's that the skill sets underlying the Corning ONE platform are directly applicable to the emerging opportunities in 5G wireless. And more to come on innovations in this space.
In summary, under the strategy and capital allocation framework, we are utilizing our financial strength both to return capital to shareholders and also to invest in growth through research and development, capital expansion and M&A.
Since we introduced the framework a year ago, we have returned a total of $5.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks, reducing outstanding shares by about 18% and increasing the dividend by 12.5%. We believe that our investments will allow us to deliver secular growth over the long term while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders.
Tony will now provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Tony?"

As we noted in today's press release, our Q3 core results reflected the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected. We were very pleased with our strong operating performance.

As we noted in today's press release, our Q3 core results reflected the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected. We were very pleased with our strong operating performance. Sales and gross margins were up in every segment year-over-year, and our net income and earnings per share were up significantly. Looking ahead, we see year-over-year sales, net income and EPS growth in the fourth quarter.
Before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the third quarter is, again, a noncash mark-to-market loss. 
As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter even though those contracts will not settle in the current quarter. 
Consequently, in this quarter, we marked our contracts to market again, as required by GAAP, resulting in a GAAP loss of $150 million. The loss in this quarter was significantly smaller than we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year because the yen exchange rates moved less. And to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.
We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have received cash totaling $1.2 billion under hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the currency-related decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen. 
At present, we have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per $1. For investors who are concerned that a weakening yen would negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.
Now for investors who have additional questions, please refer to the more extensive discussion in our first and second quarter conference call or in the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.
Now let's turn to the results for the third quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics.
Sales in the quarter were $2.55 billion, up 4% versus last year and exceeding our expectations. The growth was driven largely by strong performance in Optical Communications. 
Corporate gross margin was 43%, on track with guidance and well ahead of last year. The year-over-year improvement largely reflected improved profitability in Optical Communications and good cost performance in Display.
SG&A was 13% of sales at $328 million. RD&E costs were 7% of sales at $187 million. Total gross equity earnings were $19 million. Recall, we closed on the realignment of Dow Corning on May 31, so third quarter equity earnings predominantly reflect our equity earnings from Hemlock. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. 
Net income was $466 million, up 7% sequentially and 4% from last year's third quarter. Adjusting for the former Dow Corning silicones business equity earnings, which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 16% on the 4% sales growth. This reflects our strong underlying financial performance.
EPS was $0.42, up 24% versus last year and above expectations.
Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of common shares outstanding. And adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $721 million, up significantly over Q1 and Q2, as expected, and driven primarily by higher core net income.
Now consistent with history, we expect Q4 operating cash flow to be up sequentially. We expect the increase to be driven primarily by a reduction in working capital and other cash receipts.
Now let's look at the detailed segment results and the outlook for each business, beginning with Display Technologies.
Display had a very strong third quarter, exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the 2016 glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digits for the full year. As you would expect, there are a few puts and takes at retail versus our expectations, but the biggest driver of the growth remains TV screen size, which is tracking solidly to be more than 1.5 inches of year-over-year growth.
In the third quarter, the set makers pulled very hard for panels ahead of the Q4 peak retail season. Our customers, the panel makers, increased their utilizations to meet this demand, which resulted in additional sequential growth for the glass market. The glass market was up high single digits sequentially versus our expectations that the glass market would be up mid-single digits sequentially. Our glass volume was up slightly more than the glass market due to customer mix. For the 9th consecutive quarter, the decline in LCD glass pricing remained moderate and met the expectations we noted last quarter.
These drivers produced the strong results for our Display business in the third quarter, with sales up 7% and net income up 14% sequentially. And forward-looking weeks of supply chain inventory remained at a healthy level and panel maker inventories remain lean.
As I already said, we expect the 2016 glass market and our volume will be up mid-single digits for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect panel maker utilization to remain high and glass supply to remain tight, so we could see Q4 glass volume consistent with Q3. But in light of the third quarter upside, it only follows that our fourth quarter volume may be down slightly. Therefore, while our overall guidance for the year remains unchanged, our guidance for the fourth quarter glass volume is consistent to down slightly sequentially, and we will watch this closely as the quarter unfolds.
In the fourth quarter, we expect LCD glass prices to decline moderately and be more moderate than Q3. And we expect that the moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last 9 quarters will continue or even improve for 2 reasons. 
First, we monitor utilization and market demand and other market factors very closely, and all of those indicate the glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year and into 2017, especially in large Gen sizes as the result of the strong TV demand. We will manage our operating capacity to our demand and maintain our stable share strategy. 
And second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though prices declines have been moderate for 2 years now, their profitability has remained low during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow down further as they try to remain profitable. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.
Let's move to Optical Communications. Overall, we are pleased with the growth in Optical Communications in the third quarter and expect strong growth again in Q4. Third quarter sales were $795 million, up 6% versus last year, with fiber-to-the-home very strong.
While our growth in Optical Communications was strong on an absolute basis, we missed our own guidance because growth in hyperscale data center projects was below expectations. Note that our sales for a large hyperscale data center range from $5 million to $10 million, so delay of a single project can reduce total segment growth by more than 1 percentage point. We remain well-positioned to capture secular long-term growth in the hyperscale segment.
Net income at $98 million was up 38% over last year. Improved manufacturing costs and favorable shift toward sales of our solution products contributed to the higher year-over-year profitability.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow in the high single digits year-over-year, led by continued fiber-to-the-home strength. We expect hyperscale sales to continue growing faster than the overall Optical Communications segment, but at a rate lower than we anticipated earlier in the year. 
In Environmental, Q3 sales were up 3% versus last year and slightly ahead of expectations. Sales of light-duty substrates for auto were a record, up 17% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand in North America, Europe and China and additional platform wins. This strength was offset by continued weakness for heavy-duty products in North America and China. Note, we expect the market for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be down 30% this year.
Net income declined $3 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down low single digits versus Q4 last year as weakness continues in the heavy-duty truck markets.
Let's move to Specialty Materials, where both sales and net income were ahead of our expectations. Year-over-year, Q3 sales increased 2% and net income was consistent. Compared to the second quarter, Q3 sales grew 11%, while net income was impacted by ramp-up costs associated with the launch of new products and customer mix. With the majority of the launch spend behind us, we expect fourth quarter profitability to improve.
Earlier, Wendell noted that we introduced Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+ in the third quarter. Just last week, Chinese OEM Oppo announced Gorilla Glass 5 on its R9s and R9s Plus smartphones. And you can expect to see them on additional devices in the coming months.
Volume growth in Gorilla Glass is expected to drive the high single-digit year-over-year sales growth we expect for the segment in the fourth quarter.
In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were $214 million and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million. And we expect Q4 sales to be up low single digits versus last year. 
Now I'll cover additional items in our fourth quarter outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect our fourth quarter gross margins to be consistent with Q3 at 43%, which is up 1 percentage point from last year's fourth quarter. Our view reflects the higher sales we expect in Optical Communications and year-over-year cost reductions in Display. SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively, and we expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million.
Now we expect total gross equity earnings to be between $75 million and $85 million. This is higher than some analysts were modeling, driven by higher sales from Hemlock's solar business, as customers complete their annual contract commitments. Versus last year, Hemlock's contributions to our net income is expected to be up $10 million to $15 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 15%.
Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with the strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and earnings in the third quarter, and we expect similarly strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. 
Other than Optical Communications, all of our businesses met or exceeded expectations. While we do not expect Optical Communications to grow quite as fast as our prior guidance for the back half of the year, we are still delighted with high single-digit growth and believe that we remain well positioned to continue growing more than twice the rate of the overall telecom industry.
Stepping back, our performance demonstrates the benefits of the strategy in capital allocation framework introduced last fall. Under that framework, we expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders, and we will have returned $6 billion by year-end. 
We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the cost of innovation and increase the barriers to entry for our competition. And we have a rich set of growth opportunities. Overall, we feel very good about where we are. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So we don't think it has a big impact. In terms of from a Note 7 standpoint, of course, you never want to see a customer have an issue like that. But from an overall standpoint, we sell into the -- that Note 7's into the premium handheld market, and it just depends on what people who were going to buy that buy instead. And as long as they buy a premium phone, of course, we have very high share on the premium phones.

And you saw us in this last quarter introduce 2 of them, right? And then -- and the takeup on GG 5 has made us feel good, and that's definitely going to help. The other piece is increasing the amount of glass utilized both in -- on phones, as well as other apps, like wearables. And those performance improvements that we've announced on GG 5, and then previously on GG 4, certainly have shifted the design conversation towards a desire to use all-glass enclosures or to use more glass per enclosure. It's too early to tell how those design conversations turn into product sets. And -- but it's without doubt, our improving performance is enabling designers to think about the product in a different way. Just think about it this way. If you think it's likely the material is going to break if it's dropped on asphalt, then you probably aren't going to double the amount of that material and put it on both fronts and backs. If you think it is unlikely that, that happens, and GG 5 certainly makes it less likely, right, and the other products we're working on will make it less likely still, then that opens up the potential to consider that type of design choice. But it's still too early to bank it. It's our strategic desire, we're making progress, but way too early to declare victory, okay?"

To the extent that they take out existing panel capacity then to put in place the new capacity, your question could impact the behavior at that micro level. So let us think little bit more about that. As we step back and think about P-OLED overall, right, as you've heard us speak before, we look at this as a net positive for us on volume because our share is so high on P-OLED relative to the LTPS product that it is replacing. On the dynamic that you're discussing, when -- if we have a customer where we have an above average market share, right, that takes out capacity, then that could impact us for a temporary time period until the whole thing rebalances, for about 1 or 2 share points. Well, similarly, if we have a customer that has -- below our average market share and they take our capacity, we could see a gain that would be temporary for a while until the whole industry rebalances. But how that all dynamic works its way through, I think we've got to do a little bit better job explaining. And we'll do that as we get a little closer to next year, Stan."
