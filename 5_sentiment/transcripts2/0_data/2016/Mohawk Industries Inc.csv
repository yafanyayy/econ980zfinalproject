31670,321982204,942274,"Mohawk Industries Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. First, I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income",2761,"Thank you, Frank. First, I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income exceeded $1 billion and improved 26% compared to 2014. Last year, we achieved record earnings per share in each quarter with about 30% of our business outside the United States where we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. If adjusted for exchange rate changes, our 2015 net sales would have been $490 million higher, an impact of approximately 6%, and our operating income would've been $74 million higher, a 9% impact. 
Our strong performance was a result of aggressive growth strategy and targeted investments we began in 2013 as the economic recovery gained momentum. Since that time, we've invested almost $5 billion, of which about $3.5 billion was in 9 acquisitions to expand our product geographies and market share, and about $1.5 billion was in our existing businesses to introduce innovative products, enhance manufacturing efficiencies and expand our capability.
While making these investments for future growth, we improved our balance sheet and reduced our leverage, enabling us to optimize our returns. We remain optimistic about 2016 and will invest in additional $600 million to $650 million in internal projects this year, which include increased ceramic capacity and upgrades in our U.S, Mexico, Europe and Russia; process improvements in carpet manufacturing; additional LVT manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe; increased wood production in the U.S. and Europe and installation of advanced technology in our laminate business.
During 2015, we changed our organizational structure to create 3 segments: Global Ceramic, Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World. This restructuring has enabled us to optimize our assets, leverage our customer relationships and transfer best practices to maximize our profitability. By fostering greater interaction between our teams, we delivered innovative new products, increased collaboration among our sales groups and improve productivity and cost across our global organization. 
Last year's result of continuous improvement, we closed all or part of 13 plants and warehouses across the enterprise to streamline the business. Over the past year, we completed 4 acquisitions. The IVC Group is a major fully integrated vinyl flooring manufacturer that provides Mohawk with leading positions in the U.S. and Europe in both sheet vinyl and luxury tile. Kai extended our leading position in ceramic tile into Eastern Europe. The acquisition of a ceramic plant in Northwest Mexico provided a new supply strategy, giving us advantages in the Western U.S. and Mexico. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired the 3 plans to expand our European installation board business.
In 2015, to support future growth, we expanded our capacity in ceramic tile, polyester carpet, LVT and premium laminate. In our higher-growth products and geographies, we increased investments in new product samples and merchandising systems as well as sales personnel to increase our market penetration. Our results reflect the great work of a deep and talented management team that concurrently executed complex initiatives across multiple product categories and geographies. 
Despite some moderation the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter, we're entering 2016 with cautious optimism based on a number of leading indicators, including a healthy consumer with rising household spending, low gasoline prices and improving unemployment rate. With mortgage rates remaining at historic lows, 2015 existing home sales rose more than 6% year-over-year. The National Association of Home Builders reported that new single-family home construction rose last year to the highest level since 2007 with expectations for continued gains in 2016. Rising home values accelerated housing turnover and the aging of the country's residential infrastructure will continue to affect home improvement investments, which Harvard's LIRA Index predicts will surpass the previous peak of 2006. The American Institute of Architects correctly predicted solid growth in commercial construction in 2015 and forecast continued commercial growth in 2016 with hotel and office space leading the category. 
Low oil prices are expected to keep the Russian economy in recession through 2016. The Mexican economy is benefiting from low unemployment, strong consumer activity from -- and government reforms that are improving the construction in the country, the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program is providing stimulus for growth in the region and most economists are predicting modest gains for the Eurozone in 2016.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Our record adjusted earnings per share rose 24% to $2.82 even as we increased investments to improve future results. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter with record adjusted earnings per share. Our net sales of $2.0 billion were a record in the period and represent an increase of 13% on a constant exchange rate basis and same days basis. Our adjusted quarterly operating income margin rose to 14% of sales, an increase of 260 basis points due to productivity volume and lower cost. Every segment delivered sales growth on a comparable basis while also expanding margin.
I'll now review the fourth quarter performance by segment. Our global ceramic segment net sales adjusted for currency translation and days rose 7% with adjusted operating income up 14% on a constant exchange rate basis. We continue to reap the benefits of our Marazzi and Kai acquisition. The combined R&D of our worldwide ceramic business has dramatically enhanced our style leadership, product technology and process enhancement. In addition, we're using our Italian, Bulgarian, Russian and Mexican ceramic capacity to support sales into the United States market. 
Our North American business makes up the majority of our ceramic segment. In the U.S. market, new home construction represented the most robust channel during the quarter, followed by commercial and residential remodeling. Our margins increased during the period as we improved our mix, enhanced our productivity and leveraged our overhead. We increased our sales investments to improve our market position by increasing service centers, expanding our sales personnel and upgrading our distribution. Our ceramic statements program, a store-within-a-store concept has grown to include 215 of our country's largest dealers and is enhancing their sales and margin. We continue to improve our position in the home center channel with greater commitments for both floor and wall tile. Our American OEM Marazzi brands are growing sales through our partnerships with leading independent distributors and through our own cobranded service centers in markets without strong partners. We're increasing our product mix as we introduced higher-style products in larger style sizes, plant, store look, hexagons and bricks. We also are introducing large and small wall tiles with unique surface structures, which are now used as focal point in all areas of the home. 
We made significant progress in realigning our plants and production lines to specialize in different products, optimizing our productivity and service. Our new Tennessee portion plant is in the final stages of construction and should start up within the quarter. There will be 3 new kilns, which begin production during 2016, and we expect to fully benefit from these by 2017. The new plant will enhance our premium offering to replace products that we have historically imported, improving our servicing costs. We have integrated the ceramic plant we acquired in Western Mexico and have improved its capacity and cost structures. Shipping from the facilities should provide us advantages within the western part of the U.S. and Mexico. 
The Mexican economy is doing well, and the ceramic industry there grew by more than 15% in 2016. Due to the investments we made in Salamanca in 2012, we've been able to outpace market growth. We have dramatically expanded our product offering in all price points and have improved our margin and mix as we increased our market share. To continue this progress we, are planning to increase of the capacity of our Salamanca plant to greater participate in the Central Mexico region that makes up 60% of the total market. Our European ceramic sales have been growing in a lackluster market. Our product mix has improved as we introduced uniquely styled products and expanded our margins. We have successfully enhanced our product offering and we're now expanding our sales force, introducing new merchandising and escalating our retail sales training. We anticipate completing the second phase of our equipment upgrades by the second quarter, which will further enhance our product offering and improve our cost structure. The third phase of equipment upgrades will begin the end of this year and complete our major investments to modernize the Marazzi assets we acquired in 2013. The optimization of our Bulgarian ceramic operation continues with a focus on improving our product offering. We have a strong management team in Bulgaria enhancing our internal processes and manufacturing methods. We're improving our mix by increasing the use of digital designs and larger sizes, implementing more automation and supplying product to the U.S., Eastern Europe and other international markets.
In Russia, we gained market share in the period as sales increased and margins compressed. Our comparisons in the fourth quarter and first quarter will be difficult due to consumers accelerating purchases a year ago. We have outperformed the market due to our strong brand position, new styles and larger and smaller sizes and increased distribution in both the remodeling and new construction channels. We're expanding our porcelain capacity, which was fully utilized last year. 
Our North America segment's net sales were up 6% on an adjusted days basis with adjusted operated earnings expanding 31%. All of our product categories contributed to our growing profitability, and we are well positioned in each product category to take advantage of the improving U.S. market. 
The carpet industry's growth remains lower than the hard surface categories. Our profitability continues to increase even though carpet sales were softer and pricing was impacted by price and mix pressure. We've taken many actions to optimize our business profitability, which is expanding with the business cycle. Our builders in multifamily residential business continue to outperform the remodeling channel. Sales of our premium carpet products, including our luxury Karastan brand and SmartStrand product collections grew during the period. We continue to introduce differentiated products with our SmartStrand silk natural collection, which replicates the appearance of wool with superior softness, texture performance. We further extended our SmartStrand family with our all-new all-pet protection which enhances -- which has enhancements for cleaning up accidents. This collection was voted by retailers as the most innovative flooring product in the industry at the recent show in Las Vegas. 
We also enhanced our continuum recycle polyester by introducing forever fresh carpets with odor-eliminating technology, which gives consumers another reason to trade up to Mohawk. 
We are continuing the expansion of our sales teams as well as increasing their specialization to maximize our participation in each end market. 
Our commercial margins continue to improve as a result of our new product introduction, streamline manufacturing and plant consolidation. Our carpet tile sales are increasing as market continues to expand and sales of our DuraColor-branded products are increasing through their premium performance characteristics. We've expanded the shapes and sizes of our carpet tile, and we've introduced new collections with cushion that improve comfort and reduces noise. To extend our participation in value-oriented commercial carpet, we launched new collections made with our exclusive recycle continuum polyester.
Our carpet operations continued the simplifications of our raw material components and manufacturing. Last year, we closed 10 plants and warehouses and several production line. All of these actions are contributing to the improvement of our cost as well as the enhancement of our efficiency quality and service levels. 
Our rug business continues to outperform the overall segment. Our new product innovation is creating more fashionable accessory rugs made with our exclusive fibers, providing softer characteristics with greater value. We are introducing new rug categories including commercial and residential utility mats and flat woven outdoor rugs. 
Our North America laminate and wood business continues to improve as we enhanced the differentiation of our products. We're expanding our new impressive laminate collection, which provides stylized look unachievable in natural wood. We're increasing our laminate production with new technology to support these unique features. In addition to our best-in-class innovation, we also extended our design leadership by introducing newer longer and wider planks in both laminate and wood collections. Our engineered wood sales continued to grow and are planning new investments to support increased demand. We are launching unique Pergo branded collections in wood, laminate and LVT into the specialty retail channel to leverage one of the most recognized consumer brands in the flooring industry. The new Pergo products were debuted at the recent industry show and were enthusiastically received by the retail community.
The reorganization of our U.S. vinyl business has been completed with the former IVT management team directing the product offering and marketing strategies for all of our vinyl products and brands. Our IVC vinyl sales are performing as planned, and we are introducing cheap vinyl and LVT products into our Mohawk brand from our U.S. facility. 
Our new LVT plant continues to improve in performance with increased production. We anticipate that the present production line will be operating at plant levels by the end of the year. LVT continues to take share in the U.S. flooring market as sales of the category expand across all channels and end-users. Our sales trends anticipates full utilization of our current LVT capacity, and we have announced investment to further increase our production and expand our product offering. We are also expanding our sheet vinyl business across other brands and leveraging our customer relationships to increase our market penetration. We're continuing to ramp up our Mohawk-branded sheet vinyl sales and build our multifamily and retail market, and we're developing new products to extend our sheet vinyl further into the commercial channels. Our flooring North America segment has made progress in expanding our brands and customer relationships expanding our style and design, transferring innovative manufacturing practices and utilizing the Mohawk distribution for all products.
During the period, both sales and margins in our Flooring Rest of World segment rose dramatically in a muted economic environment due to improved results and IVC acquisition. Our local -- on a local basis adjusted for days, net sales for the segment increased 41%. Adjusted operating income was 59%, up on a constant exchange rate basis. The leadership with the Flooring Rest of World segment has been reorganized to leverage sales, manufacturing and product management for the entire organization. Our new vinyl business is being holistically managed to optimize our asset distribution and best practices across the segment. Our laminate wood business in Europe outperformed the market as a result of our focus on differentiated products at mid- to high-end price points. Where we operate direct distribution, it has enhanced our market share and increased our penetration. We continue to expand our latest embossing technology, which creates more realistic visuals. We will further extend this technology in new larger plank to be launched later this year. To meet the growing demand, we're installing additional capacity this year. Our European wood sales are growing quickly, and we are taking market share. The plant we acquired 2 years ago is operating near capacity with the balance of our product needs coming from a relation facility. We're planning to expand our engineered wood capacity in the Czech Republic. 
The legacy IVC vinyl business is reaching full capacity, and the sheet vinyl and LVT were achieving some capacity increases through process improvement. The new LVT plant in Belgium is operating well and the sales are developing better than planned. This plan has temporarily constrained by manufacturing limitations, which will be addressed with additional equipment, increasing the capacity by 40% in the middle of this year. To meet current demand, we're importing LVT to supplement our credit capacity, and we're planning further investments to add a new LVT production line. We are continuing to develop new products in anticipation of these increased capabilities. Our installation business had record sales of this year. We continue to enhance our distribution and manufacturing capability, including the addition of another production shift at our plant in France. At the end of the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 3 installation board plants in Ireland, the U.K. and Belgium to expand our offering and geographic footprint. Our management structure has already been reorganized, and we're identifying opportunities to enhance all the operations. Our other board product sales were up slightly with margins is improving for mix, asset upgrades and plant consolidations.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."
31670,321982204,942274,"Mohawk Industries Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff.

Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew",1025,"Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,998,000,000, up 2% as reported. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had 4 fewer days than we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew 13% or 4% excluding acquisitions. Foreign exchange reduced sales $86 million compared to last year. All segments grew at a legacy basis using a constant exchange rate basis -- constant exchange rate and days. Acquisitions and volume increases were the primary drivers. 
Our gross margin was 31.1% as reported. Excluding charges, the margin was 31.9%, up 360 basis points from last year. Higher volume, productivity and lower raw materials were the biggest contributors to this increase. 
Our SG&A as reported was $373 million or 18.7% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 18% of net sales, up from 17% last year. Fewer days in the quarter and investments back into SG&A moved a percent up from last year. Our focus on investments allowed for better sales growth as well as improved mix in the quarter. We anticipate the SG&A percentage improving to a lower number in 2016 as we leverage spending against sales growth. Unusual charges for the quarter were $28 million with approximately $20 million associated with our acquisitions. The balance was due to restructuring actions in the North American flooring segment. 
For the full year, we had $212 million in nonrecurring expense with $122 million of that related to a legal settlement, which, by the way, we believe was extortion: $70 million per acquisitions and $17 million for restructuring of existing businesses. Of the acquisition costs, $8 million were for M&A fees, $14 million were for inventory step-ups related to purchase accounting and $48 million for plant closures, manufacturing consolidations, administrative reductions and system upgrades, all to improve profitability.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 260 basis points, and our operating income would have been $12 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Interest expense was $18 million and showed improvement this year due to a premium paid last year on the early redemption of some of our bonds. 
Other expense was $12 million and includes a charge for unwinding an $11 million indemnification receivable recorded in the IVC purchase accounting earlier in the year. There's also an offsetting $11 million benefit included in tax expense as reported as related liability was unwound. The income tax rate excluding unusual items for the quarter was 18.7% compares to a 19% rate last year. We expect the first quarter rate in this year to be 25% and the full year rate for 2016 to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. And I'll remind you that our rate fluctuates by quarter depending upon timing for certain tax deductions. 
Our earnings per share excluding charges was $2.82, which represents an increase of 24% over last year.
Turning to the segments. In the global ceramic segment, sales were $712 million, down 4% as reported. Using a constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business, it was up 4%. FX was a $45 million headwind in the quarter for this segment. All regions are up on a constant currency and days basis. Our operating income margin excluding charges were 13%. This expanded 150 basis points over last year, and operating income would have been $5 million higher using constant exchange rates. Productivity and improving mix were the biggest drivers of this increase. 
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $880 million. They were flat as reported but increased by 3% on a constant days basis for the legacy business. Hard surface products grew at a faster rate than self-service. Our operating margin excluding charges was 14.2%. That is up 340 basis points from last year with productivity and input cost the biggest contributors to the improvement, partially offset by pricing mix. Our team continues to produce better results through continuous improvements and innovative products. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segments, sales were $407 million, up 22% as reported or up 7% using constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business. This was unusually high due to laminate, wood, LVT and intellectual property sales, which we do not believe will continue in the next year. FX was a $42 million impact on revenues during the quarter. Our wood and vinyl products both had strong quarters, and we believe they outperform the industry. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 16.4%, up 240 basis points from last year. And operating income would have been $7 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Volume, productivity and input costs were the biggest drivers of growth here.
In 2015, we had operating income from our patents, which was $130 million and was higher than last year due to payments for past due fees. We expect 2016 to be 5% to 10% lower. After June 2017, when UniClic patents expire, we estimate annualized operating income of $30 million to $35 million from other patents. In addition, over the next few years, we'll benefit from internal investments, both current and future acquisitions and lower interest costs.
So if we turn to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the year at $1.3 billion with days sales outstanding at 55 days compared to 54 days last year. These days in the current year were slightly impacted by a change in channel mix. Inventories ended the year at $1.6 billion. Our inventory days continue to show strong improvement at 112 days for the quarter compared to last year's 116 days. Fixed assets were $3.1 billion and includes fourth quarter capital expenditures of $152 million and depreciation and amortization of $94 million. Capital expenditures for the full year were $504 million with D&A of $363 million. We estimate $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for 2016, with depreciation and amortization estimated at $400 million for 2016. Long-term debt was $3.2 billion at the end of the year. Our leverage ended the year at 2.1x debt to EBITDA on a pro forma basis. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff for concluding remarks."

We have taken many actions to outperform the industry in each of our products and geographies over the past few years and will continue to benefit from those strategies this year.

In the carpet business, we believe that our focus on new innovative products is expanding our position within the marketplace.

In the carpet business, we believe that our focus on new innovative products is expanding our position within the marketplace. We are dramatically cutting the cost structures we have to improve margin in what's going to be a lower-growth business. In the rug business, we're going into new product categories that we weren't in as well as we introduced new products. In the ceramic business in North America, we're the leader in offering a total broad product line in all categories. We're putting new investments in that allow us to make products with the majority of the people in the United States can't and give us leading positions in style and design. In Mexico, we're expanding from a relevantly small base. We had success in filling up a brand-new plant from 2012. And at this moment, we're planning to double the size of that plant again this year to take advantage of our expanding distribution in the marketplace. In Europe, the ceramic business has been limited growth, But through our investments, we've been able to significantly cut the cost and at the same time, we've been able to bring new product and innovation to the marketplace, which is allowing us to grow in a low-growth market, but our primary objective was we bought the business that was not profitable and expand the margins, but there is some increase in capacity as we go through. The new acquisition with Kai, they have a high position in their market share in their markets. We're continuing to support them to optimize that business through improving the mix and giving them opportunities to sell product outside their local region with all our other sales and marketing people across the country. The Russian business, we're growing market share significantly. As the market declined last year, our volume was flat or up a little bit in a marketplace that was declining significantly. We've been able to do that through we have the leading style and design in the marketplace where the best option for high-style product continues to be imported out of Italy, which we can make in there. Our high-end ceramic capacity was fully utilized last year, and we're actually increasing our capacity in Russia in a market that's horrible. At the same time, we're reducing the strength of our business to increase the distribution into the various channels and optimize our brand. Moving back into the Flooring Rest of The world, our laminate, we focused on medium to high in Europe. We have brought unique product innovation to the marketplace, which we started introducing last year. We've extended it this year. We have run out of capacity in that category, which is being installed the first this year, so that we can keep growing that, which is very unique. We have multiple brands in the marketplace, which we go after different channels of the marketplace. The acquisition of IVC brought us another brand that's focused on a lower price category than the other was we have. So we're using it to expand our distribution across the marketplace but still not in the commodity areas. The wood business, we still have a limited portion of a very large market. And because of that, we have focused on again the medium to high end. We have been able to add value to the marketplace. We bought the ceramic business in Czech 2 years ago, I think, and it's running full, and we're planning on expanding it to give us opportunities to grow further. The IVC business, we managing through the changes, and I mean, doing well. As their sales to Russia declined, we put those in the other marketplace. We think we're going to be pushing the limits of the capacity in sheet vinyl. In LVT, the 2 plants that we have are selling everything they can make. The newer plant, which is the one that we started building before then, they help us optimize and by the middle of the year, we will increase the capacity by about another 40%. We have planned to put another line in our facilities over there to grow further in the marketplace in LVT. And then we have our other -- our insulation board business, we had 2 plants that we greenfielded both. The first  one has been running at full capacity. The second one is in France. We're adding in addition to it as we speak and repurchase another business that the had different geographic persons as well as slightly different products in it. And then our board businesses, we spent money consolidating those and increasing the capacity limited more and cost savings and closing plants, and we should get most of those benefits during this year."

In the context of 2 realities that I've been thinking about. First is there's been a quantum leap in recent years with respect to visual productions, the ability to achieve visuals. And that's about customers to achieve remarkably similar looks across a variety of flooring materials. And the second thing is that Mohawk seems to be uniquely positioned capitalized on this convergence or flexibility in design across many, many different products, given that you are major manufacturer in all of these products and nobody else really is. So, I guess, kind of a 2-part question with that. One, do you think longer-term that the improved visuals is going to introduce negative mix shift as people sort of achieve those visuals were cheaper materials are instead you think it's going to lead to a desire on the part of consumers to spend more money more of the design dollars on the floor given the innovation.

On the other hand, by having better looks and different product categories, my personal view, which I can't say everybody agrees with me, is like wood that sells at higher prices, I think given the alternatives for wood, there's a possibility that people use those in place of wood and those things are using our lower price and I have no idea how the mix is going to change between the categories and neither does anybody else. On the use of our various assets, it is a huge benefit because all the similar looks are selling at all the different product categories. We are unique in having capabilities between laminate, wood, vinyl and ceramic that the same technology and same style and design still all of them.

First I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income e",2755,"Thank you, Frank. First I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income exceeded $1 billion and improved 26% compared to 2014. Last year, we achieved record earnings per share in each quarter, with about 30% of our business outside the United States where we faced significant foreign exchange headwind. If adjusted for exchange rate changes, our 2015 net sales would have been $490 million higher, an impact of approximately 6%. And our operating income would've been $74 million higher, a 9% impact. 
Our strong performance was a result of aggressive growth strategy and targeted investments we began in 2013 as the economic recovery gained momentum. Since that time, we've invested almost $5 billion, of which about $3.5 billion was in 9 acquisitions to expand our products, geographies and market share, and about $1.5 billion was in our existing businesses to introduce innovative products, enhance manufacturing efficiencies and expand our capability.
While making these investments for future growth, we improved our balance sheet and reduced our leverage, enabling us to optimize our returns. We remain optimistic about 2016 and will invest in additional $600 million to $650 million in internal projects this year, which include increased ceramic capacity and upgrades in our U.S., Mexico, Europe and Russia; process improvements in carpet manufacturing; additional LVT manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe; increased wood production in the U.S. and Europe; and installation of advanced technology in our laminate business.
During 2015, we changed our organizational structure to create 3 segments: Global Ceramic, Flooring North America; and Flooring Rest of the World. This restructuring has enabled us to optimize our assets, leverage our customer relationships and transfer best practices to maximize our profitability. By fostering greater interaction between our teams, we delivered innovative new products, increased collaboration among our sales groups and improved productivity in costs across our global organization. 
Last year's results of continuous improvement, we closed all or part of 13 plants and warehouses across the enterprise to streamline the business. Over the past year, we completed 4 acquisitions. The IVC Group is a major fully integrated vinyl flooring manufacturer that provides Mohawk with leading positions in the U.S. and Europe in both sheet vinyl and luxury tile. Kai extended our leading position in ceramic tile into Eastern Europe. The acquisition of a ceramic plant in Northwest Mexico provided a new supply strategy, giving us advantages in the Western U.S. and Mexico. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the 3 plants to expand our European installation board business.
In 2015, to support future growth, we expanded our capacities in ceramic tile, polyester carpet, LVT and premium laminate. In our higher-growth products and geographies, we increased investments in new product samples and merchandising systems as well as sales personnel to increase our market penetration. Our results reflect the great work of a deep and talented management team that concurrently executed complex initiatives across multiple product categories and geographies. 
Despite some moderation in the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter, we're entering 2016 with cautious optimism based on a number of leading indicators, including a healthy consumer with rising household spending, low gasoline prices and improving unemployment rate. With mortgage rates remaining at historic lows, 2015 existing home sales rose more than 6% year-over-year. The National Association of Home Builders reported that new single-family home construction rose last year to the highest level since 2007 with expectations for continued gains in 2016. Rising home values accelerated housing turnover. And the aging of the country's residential infrastructure will continue to affect home improvement investments, which Harvard's LIRA Index predicts will surpass the previous peak of 2006. The American Institute of Architects correctly predicted solid growth in commercial construction in 2015 and forecast continued commercial growth in 2016, with hotel and office space leading the category. 
Low oil prices are expected to keep the Russian economy in recession through 2016. The Mexican economy is benefiting from low unemployment, strong consumer activity from -- and government reforms that are improving the construction in the country. The European Central Bank's quantitative easing program is providing stimulus for growth in the region, and most economists are predicting modest gains for the eurozone in 2016.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Our record adjusted earnings per share rose 24% to $2.82, even as we increased investments to improve future results. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter with record adjusted earnings per share. Our net sales of $2.0 billion were a record in the period and represent an increase of 13% on a constant exchange rate basis and same days basis. Our adjusted quarterly operating income margin rose to 14% of sales, an increase of 260 basis points, due to productivity volume and lower cost. Every segment delivered sales growth on a comparable basis while also expanding margin.
I'll now review the fourth quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment net sales, adjusted for currency translation and days, rose 7% with adjusted operating income up 14% on a constant exchange rate basis. We continue to reap the benefits of our Marazzi and Kai acquisition. The combined R&D of our worldwide ceramic business has dramatically enhanced our style leadership, product technology and process enhancement. In addition, we're using our Italian, Bulgarian, Russian and Mexican ceramic capacity to support sales in the United States market. 
Our North American business makes up the majority of our ceramic segment. In the U.S. market, new home construction represented the most robust channel during the quarter, followed by commercial and residential remodeling. Our margins increased during the period as we improved our mix, enhanced our productivity and leveraged our overhead. We increased our sales investments to improve our market position by increasing service centers, expanding our sales personnel and upgrading our distribution. Our ceramic statements program, a store-within-a-store concept has grown to include 215 of our country's largest dealers and enhancing their sales and margin. We continue to improve our position in the home center channel with greater commitments for both floor and wall tile. 
Our American Olean and Marazzi brands are growing sales through partnerships with leading independent distributors and through our own co-branded service centers in markets without strong partners. We're increasing our product mix as we introduce higher-style products in larger sizes, planks, stone look, hexagons and bricks. We also are introducing large and small wall tiles with unique surface structures, which are now used as focal point in all areas of the home. 
We made significant progress in realigning our plants and production lines to specialize in different products, optimizing our productivity and service. Our new Tennessee porcelain plant is in the final stages of construction and should start up within the quarter. There will be 3 new kilns, which begin production during 2016, and we expect to fully benefit from these by 2017. The new plant will enhance our premium offering and replace products that we have historically imported, improving our servicing costs. We have integrated the ceramic plant we acquired in Western Mexico and have improved its capacity and cost structures. Shipping from the facility should provide us advantages within the western part of the U.S. and Mexico. 
The Mexican economy is doing well, and the ceramic industry there grew by more than 15% in 2016. Due to the investments we made in Salamanca in 2012, we've been able to outpace market growth. We've dramatically expanded our product offering in all price points and have improved our margin and mix as we increased our market share. To continue this progress, we're planning to increase the capacity of our Salamanca plant to greater participate in the Central Mexico region that makes up 60% of the total market. 
Our European ceramic sales have been growing in a lackluster market. Our product mix has improved, as we introduced uniquely styled products and expanded our margins. We have successfully enhanced our product offering, and we're now expanding our sales force, introducing new merchandising and escalating our retail sales training. We anticipate completing the second phase of our equipment upgrades by the second quarter, which will further enhance our product offering and improve our cost structure. The third phase of equipment upgrades will begin the end of this year and complete our major investments to modernize the Marazzi assets we acquired in 2013. The optimization of our Bulgarian ceramic operation continues with a focus on improving our product offering. We have a strong management team in Bulgaria that's enhancing our internal processes and manufacturing method. We're improving our mix by increasing the use of digital designs and larger sizes, implementing more automation and supplying product to the U.S., Eastern Europe and other international markets.
In Russia, we gained market share in the period as sales increased and margins compressed. Our comparisons in the fourth quarter to first quarter will be difficult due to consumers accelerating purchases a year ago. We have outperformed the market due to our strong brand position, new styles and larger and smaller sizes and increased distribution in both the remodeling and new construction channels. We're expanding our porcelain capacity, which was fully utilized last year. 
Our North America segment's net sales were up 6% on an adjusted days basis with adjusted operating earnings expanding 31%. All of our product categories contributed to our growing profitability, and we are well positioned in each product category to take advantage of an improving U.S. market. The carpet industry's growth remains lower than the hard surface categories. Our profitability continues to increase, even though carpet sales were softer and pricing was impacted by price and mix pressure. We've taken many actions to optimize our business profitability, which is expanding with the business cycle. Our builders in multifamily residential business continue to outperform the remodeling channel. 
Sales of our premium carpet products, including our luxury Karastan brand and SmartStrand product collections grew during the period. We continue to introduce differentiated products with our SmartStrand Silk naturals collection, which replicates the appearance of wool with superior softness, texture performance. We further extended our SmartStrand family with our all-new all-pet protection, which enhances -- which has enhancements for cleaning up accidents. This collection was voted by retailers as the most innovative flooring product in the industry at the recent show in Las Vegas. 
We also enhanced our Continuum recycle polyester by introducing Forever Fresh carpets with odor-eliminating technology, which gives consumers another reason to trade up to Mohawk. We're continuing the expansion of our sales teams as well as increasing their specialization to maximize our participation in each end market. 
Our commercial margins continue to improve as a result of our new product introduction, streamlined manufacturing and plant consolidations. Our carpet tile sales are increasing as the market continues to expand and sales of our DuraColor-branded products are increasing through their premium performance characteristics. We've expanded the shapes and sizes of our carpet tiles, and we've introduced new collections with cushion that improve comfort and reduces noise. To extend our participation in value-oriented commercial carpet, we launched new collections made with our exclusive recycled Continuum polyester.
Our carpet operations continue the simplifications of our raw material components at manufacturing. Last year, we closed 10 plants and warehouses and several production line. All of these actions are contributing to the improvement of our cost as well as the enhancement of our efficiency, quality and service levels. 
Our rug business continues to outperform the overall segment. Our new product innovation is creating more fashionable accent rugs made with our exclusive fibers, providing softer characteristics with greater value. We're entering new rug categories, including commercial and residential utility mats and flat woven outdoor rugs. 
Our North American laminate and wood business continues to improve as we enhance the differentiation of our products. We're expanding our new impressive laminate collection, which provides stylized looks unachievable in natural wood. We're increasing our laminate production with new technology to support these unique features. 
In addition to our best-in-class innovation, we also extended our design leadership by introducing newer longer and wider planks in both laminate and wood collections. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow, and we're planning new investments to support increased demand. We're launching unique Pergo branded collections in wood, laminate and LVT into the specialty retail channel to leverage one of the most recognized consumer brands in the flooring industry. The new Pergo products were debuted at the recent industry show and were enthusiastically received by the retail community.
The reorganization of our U.S. vinyl business has been completed with the former IVC management team directing the product offering and marketing strategies for all of our vinyl products and brands. Our IVC vinyl sales are performing as planned, and we're introducing sheet vinyl and LVT products into our Mohawk brands from our U.S. facility. 
Our new LVT plant continues to improve in performance with increased production. We anticipate that the present production line will be operating as planned levels by the end of the year. LVT continues to take share in the U.S. flooring market as sales of the category expand across all channels and end users. Our sales trends anticipate full utilization of our current LVT capacity, and we have announced investments to further increase our production and expand our product offering. 
We are also expanding our sheet vinyl business across other brands and leveraging our customer relationships to increase our market penetration. We're continuing to ramp up our Mohawk-branded sheet vinyl sales in builder multifamily and retail market. And we're developing new products to extend our sheet vinyl further into the commercial channels. 
Our flooring North America segment has made progress in expanding our brands and customer relationships, expanding our style and design, transferring innovative manufacturing practices and utilizing the Mohawk distribution for all products.
During the period, both sales and margins in our Flooring Rest of World segment rose dramatically in a muted economic environment due to improved results and the IVC acquisition. Our local -- on a local basis adjusted for days, net sales for the segment increased 41%. Adjusted operating income was 59% up on a constant exchange rate basis. The leadership for the Flooring Rest of the World segment has been reorganized to leverage sales, manufacturing and product management for the entire organization. 
Our new vinyl business is being holistically managed to optimize our asset distribution and best practices across the segment. Our laminate wood business in Europe outperformed the market as a result of our focus on differentiated products at mid- to high-end price points. Where we operate direct distribution, it has enhanced our market share and increased our penetration. We continue to expand our latest embossing technology, which creates more realistic visuals. We will further extend this technology in new larger plank to be launched later this year. To meet the growing demand, we're installing additional capacity this year. 
Our European wood sales are growing quickly, and we are taking market share. The check wood plant we acquired 2 years ago is operating near capacity with the balance of our product needs coming from a Malaysian facility. We're planning to expand our engineered wood capacity in the Czech Republic. 
The legacy IVC vinyl business is reaching full capacity. In sheet vinyl and LVT, we're achieving some capacity increases through process improvement. The new LVT plant in Belgium is operating well, and the sales are developing better than planned. This plant is temporarily constrained by manufacturing limitations, which will be addressed with additional equipment, increasing the capacity by 40% in the middle of this year. To meet current demand, we're importing LVT to supplement our current capacity. And we're planning further investments to add a new LVT production line. We're continuing to develop new products in anticipation of these increased capabilities. 
Our installation business had record sales this year. We continue to enhance our distribution and manufacturing capability, including the addition of another production shift at our plant in France. At the end of the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 3 installation board plants in Ireland, the U.K. and Belgium to expand our offering and geographic footprint. Our management structure has already been reorganized, and we're identifying opportunities to enhance all the operations. Our other board product sales were up slightly with margins improving from mix, asset upgrades and plant consolidations.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."
31670,321982204,942502,"Mohawk Industries Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff.

Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew",1029,"Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,998,000,000, up 2% as reported. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had 4 fewer days than we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew 13% or 4% excluding acquisitions. Foreign exchange reduced sales $86 million compared to last year. All segments grew on a legacy basis using a constant exchange rate basis -- constant exchange rate and days. Acquisitions and volume increases were the primary drivers. 
Our gross margin was 31.1% as reported. Excluding charges, the margin was 31.9%, up 360 basis points from last year. Higher volume, productivity and lower raw materials were the biggest contributors to this increase. 
Our SG&A as reported was $373 million or 18.7% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 18% of net sales, up from 17% last year. Fewer days in the quarter and investments back in the SG&A moved the percent up from last year. Our focus on investments allowed for better sales growth as well as improved mix in the quarter. We anticipate the SG&A percentage improving to a lower number in 2016 as we leverage spending against sales growth. Unusual charges for the quarter were $28 million, with approximately $20 million associated with our acquisitions. The balance was due to restructuring actions in the North American flooring segment. 
For the full year, we had $212 million in nonrecurring expense, with $122 million of that related to a legal settlement, which by the way we believe was extortion; $70 million for acquisitions; and $17 million for restructuring of existing businesses. Of the acquisition cost, $8 million were for M&A fees; $14 million were for inventory step-ups related to purchase accounting; and $48 million for plant closures, manufacturing consolidations, administrative reductions and system upgrades, all to improve profitability.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 260 basis points, and our operating income would have been $12 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Interest expense was $18 million and showed improvement this year due to a premium paid last year on the early redemption of some of our bonds. 
Other expense was $12 million and includes a charge for unwinding an $11 million indemnification receivable recorded in the IVC purchase accounting earlier in the year. There's also an offsetting $11 million benefit included in tax expense as reported as the related liability was unwound. The income tax rate, excluding unusual items, for the quarter was 18.7%, compares to a 19% rate last year. We expect the first quarter rate in this year to be 25% and the full year rate for 2016 to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. And I'll remind you that our rate fluctuates by quarter, depending upon timing for certain tax deductions. Our earnings per share excluding charges was $2.82, which represents an increase of 24% over last year.
Turning to the segments. In the Global Ceramic segment, sales were $712 million, down 4% as reported. Using a constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business, it was up 4%. FX was a $45 million headwind in the quarter for this segment. All regions are up on a constant currency and days basis. Our operating income margin excluding charges were 13%. This expanded 150 basis points over last year. And operating income would have been $5 million higher using constant exchange rates. Productivity and improving mix were the biggest drivers of this increase. 
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $880 million. They were flat as reported but increased by 3% on a constant days basis for the legacy business. Hard surface products grew at a faster rate than soft surface. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 14.2%. That is up 340 basis points from last year, with productivity and input costs the biggest contributors to the improvement, partially offset by pricing mix. Our team continues to produce better results through continuous improvements and innovative products. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $407 million, up 22% as reported or up 7% using constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business. This was unusually high due to laminate, wood, LVT and intellectual property sales, which we do not believe will continue in the next year. FX was a $42 million impact on revenues during the quarter. Our wood and vinyl flooring products both had strong quarters, and we believe they outperformed the industry. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 16.4%, up 240 basis points from last year. And operating income would have been $7 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Volume, productivity and input costs were the biggest drivers of growth here.
In 2015, we had operating income from our patents, which was $130 million and was higher than last year due to payments for past due fees. We expect 2016 to be 5% to 10% lower. After June 2017, when the UniClic patents expire, we estimate annualized operating income of $30 million to $35 million from other patents. In addition, over the next few years, we'll benefit from internal investments, both current and future acquisitions and lower interest cost.
So if we turn to the balance sheet, receivables ended the year at $1.3 billion, with days sales outstanding at 55 days compared to 54 days last year. These days in the current year were slightly impacted by a change in channel mix. Inventories ended the year at $1.6 billion. Our inventory days continued to show strong improvement at 112 days for the quarter compared to last year's 116 days. Fixed assets were $3.1 billion and include fourth quarter capital expenditures of $152 million and depreciation and amortization of $94 million. Capital expenditures for the full year were $504 million with D&A of $363 million. We estimate $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for 2016, with depreciation and amortization estimated at $400 million for 2016. Long-term debt was $3.2 billion at the end of the year. Our leverage ended the year at 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff for concluding remarks."

We anticipate that the demand trends in our U.S. and international markets remain consistent with what we have been experiencing. Though growth in Europe is limited and negative in Russia, our international businesses are delivering solid results on a local basis. Our sales and margin should continue to improve over last year as a result of our continued innovations, process improvement and disciplined execution. Our recent acquisitions are progressing with operational market synergy as we anticipated.  This year, we will increase investments on our existing businesses to optimize our long-term performance. 
Taking these factors into account, our guidance for the first quarter is $2.24 to $2.33 per share. That would be a 32% to 37% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges. We have taken many actions to outperform the industry in each of our products and geographies over the past few years, and we'll continue to benefit from those strategies this year. In 2016, we'll continue to execute creative product ideas along with substantial investments to optimize our long-term results.
We'll now be glad to answer any question."

In the carpet business, we believe that our focus on new innovative products is expanding our position within the marketplace. We are dramatically cutting the cost structures we have and to improve margins in what's going to be a lower-growth business. In the rug business, we're going into new product categories that we weren't in as well as we've introduced new products. In the ceramic business in North America, we're the leader in offering a total broad product line in all categories. We're putting new investments in that allow us to make products that the majority of the people in the United States can't and give us leading positions in style and design. In Mexico, we're expanding from a relatively small base. We had success in filling up a brand new plant from 2012, and at this moment, we're planning to double the size of that plant again this year to take advantage of our expanding distribution in the marketplace. In Europe, the ceramic business has been limited growth, but through our investments, we've been able to significantly cut the cost. And at the same time, we've been able to bring new product innovation to the marketplace, which is allowing us to grow in a low-growth market. But our primary objective was we bought the business that was not profitable and expand the margins, but there is some increase in capacity as we go through. The new acquisition with Kai, they have a high position in their market share in their markets. We're continuing to support them to optimize that business through improving the mix and giving them opportunities to sell product outside their local region with all our other sales and marketing people across the country. The Russian business, we're growing market share significantly. As the market declined last year, our volume was flat or up a little bit in a marketplace that was declining significantly. We've been able to do that through -- we have the leading style and design in the marketplace. We're the best option for high-style product that used to be imported out of Italy, which we can make in there. Our high-end ceramic capacity was fully utilized last year, and we're actually increasing our capacity in Russia in a market that's horrible. At the same time, we're using the strength of our business to increase the distribution into the various channels and optimize our brand. Moving back into the Flooring Rest of The world, our laminate, we focus on medium to high in Europe. We have brought unique product innovation to the marketplace, which we started introducing last year. We've extended it this year. We have run out of capacity in that category, which is being installed the first of this year so that we can keep growing that, which is very unique. We have multiple brands in the marketplace, which we go after, different channels of the marketplace. The acquisition of IVC brought us another brand that's focused on a lower-price category than the other ones we have. So we're using it to expand our distribution across the marketplace, but still not in the commodity areas. The wood business, we still have a limited portion of a very large market. And because of that, we have focused on again the medium to high end. We have been able to add value to the marketplace. We bought the ceramic business in Czech 2 years ago, I think, and it's running full, and we're planning on expanding it to give us opportunities to grow further. The IVC business, we're managing through the changes, and I mean, doing well. As their sales to Russia declined, we put those in the other marketplace. We think we're going to be pushing the limits of the capacity in sheet vinyl. In LVT, the 2 plants that we have are selling everything they can make. The newer plant, which is the one that we started building before them, they've helped us optimize. And by the middle of the year, we will increase the capacity by about another 40%. We have planned to put another line in our facilities over there to grow further in the marketplace in LVT. And then we have our other -- our insulation board business. We had 2 plants that we greenfielded both. The first one has been running at full capacity. The second one is in France. We're adding another shift to it as we speak. And then we've purchased another business that had different geographic presence as well as slightly different products in it. And then our board businesses, we've spent money consolidating those and increasing the capacity limited, but it's more cost savings and closing plants, and we should get most of those benefits during this year."

I think one of the things that's lost on some people is that Unilin didn't have just good invention, but they developed the intellectual capital to be able to monetize their patent and so they kind of have a platform with which they can monetize other patents. And so my question is what's the prospects for you to be able to grow from your base of $30 million to $35 million, excluding UniClic? Is it mostly dependent upon new patents that you would have to file? Or do you think you'll be able to grow, let's say, advisory fees from helping third parties monetize their patents kind of like you did recently with your Novalis relationship."

We think that we have the right things in place to execute that. You are correct, we have unique knowledge in how to manage and create value for patents. But having something that's unique that's salable, I mean, it's not that easy or everybody would have it. So we think that the $30 million to $35 million is what we know of today.

I'm kind of thinking about your North American distribution and sales network in the context of 2 realities that I've been thinking about. First, there's been a quantum leap in recent years with respect to visual productions, the ability to achieve visuals and it's allowed customers to achieve remarkably similar looks across a variety of flooring materials. And the second thing is that Mohawk seems to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this convergence or flexibility in design across many, many different products given that you're a major manufacturer of all of these products and nobody else really is. So I guess, kind of a 2-part question with that. One, do you think longer term that the improved visuals is going to introduce negative mix shift as people sort of achieve those visuals with cheaper materials? Or instead, you think it's going to lead to a desire on the part of consumers to spend more money, more of their design dollars on the floor given the innovation? And the second question is what are some of the unique ways you can use across product sales and marketing strategy to get better profits and so in ways that your competitors simply can't because they don't make all those flooring materials?"

The first answer to your question, which was an either/or is a yes. And the yes means that in some of my product category -- in all my product categories, having better design and better features you can get a premium for, which you hear us talking about all the time. On the other hand, by having better looks and different product categories, in my personal view, which I can't say everybody agrees with me, is like wood that sells at higher prices. I think given there's more alternatives for wood, there's a possibility that people use those in place of wood and those things they're using are lower priced and I have no idea how the mix is going to change between the categories and neither does anybody else is it. On the use of our various assets, it is a huge benefit because all the similar looks are selling at all the different product categories and we are unique in having capabilities between laminate, wood, vinyl and ceramic that the same technology and same style and design, still all of them. And then with the acquisition we have of Marazzi, the Italians with style and design are way ahead of the rest of the world will use that to apply to every other one. And then I have to tell you we get ideas from our Russian business is different than it. They come up with different ideas and we have meetings where we put the different groups together and they all go about it in different ways and it gives us a unique perspective not only by product but by worldwide geographies that ideas transfer back and forth and I think that puts us in a unique position nobody else can compete with."

First I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year.

First I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income exceeded $1 billion and improved 26% compared to 2014. Last year, we achieved record earnings per share in each quarter, with about 30% of our business outside the United States where we faced significant foreign exchange headwind. If adjusted for exchange rate changes, our 2015 net sales would have been $490 million higher, an impact of approximately 6%. And our operating income would've been $74 million higher, a 9% impact. 
Our strong performance was a result of aggressive growth strategy and targeted investments we began in 2013 as the economic recovery gained momentum. Since that time, we've invested almost $5 billion, of which about $3.5 billion was in 9 acquisitions to expand our products, geographies and market share, and about $1.5 billion was in our existing businesses to introduce innovative products, enhance manufacturing efficiencies and expand our capability.
While making these investments for future growth, we improved our balance sheet and reduced our leverage, enabling us to optimize our returns. We remain optimistic about 2016 and will invest in additional $600 million to $650 million in internal projects this year, which include increased ceramic capacity and upgrades in our U.S., Mexico, Europe and Russia; process improvements in carpet manufacturing; additional LVT manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe; increased wood production in the U.S. and Europe; and installation of advanced technology in our laminate businesses.
During 2015, we changed our organizational structure to create 3 segments: Global Ceramic, Flooring North America; and Flooring Rest of the World. This restructuring has enabled us to optimize our assets, leverage our customer relationships and transfer best practices to maximize our profitability. By fostering greater interaction between our teams, we delivered innovative new products, increased collaboration among our sales groups and improved productivity in costs across our global organization. 
Last year as a result of continuous improvement, we closed all or part of 13 plants and warehouses across the enterprise to streamline the business. Over the past year, we completed 4 acquisitions. The IVC Group is a major fully integrated vinyl flooring manufacturer that provides Mohawk with leading positions in the U.S. and Europe in both sheet vinyl and luxury tile. Kai extended our leading position in ceramic tile into Eastern Europe. The acquisition of a ceramic plant in Northwest Mexico provided a new supply strategy, giving us advantages in the Western U.S. and Mexico. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the 3 plants to expand our European installation board business.
In 2015, to support future growth, we expanded our capacities in ceramic tile, polyester carpet, LVT and premium laminate. In our higher-growth products and geographies, we increased investments in new product samples and merchandising systems as well as sales personnel to increase our market penetration. Our results reflect the great work of a deep and talented management team that concurrently executed complex initiatives across multiple product categories and geographies. 
Despite some moderation in the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter, we're entering 2016 with cautious optimism based on a number of leading indicators, including a healthy consumer with rising household spending, low gasoline prices and improving unemployment rate. With mortgage rates remaining at historic lows, 2015 existing home sales rose more than 6% year-over-year. The National Association of Home Builders reported that new single-family home construction rose last year to the highest level since 2007 with expectations for continued gains in 2016. Rising home values accelerated housing turnover. And the aging of the country's residential infrastructure will continue to affect home improvement investments, which Harvard's LIRA Index predicts will surpass the previous peak of 2006. The American Institute of Architects correctly predicted solid growth in commercial construction in 2015 and forecasts continued commercial growth in 2016, with hotel and office space leading the category. 
Low oil prices are expected to keep the Russian economy in recession through 2016. The Mexican economy is benefiting from low unemployment, strong consumer activity from -- and government reforms that are improving the construction in the country. The European Central Bank's quantitative easing program is providing stimulus for growth in the region, and most economists are predicting modest gains for the eurozone in 2016.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Our record adjusted earnings per share rose 24% to $2.82, even as we increased investments to improve future results. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter with record adjusted earnings per share. Our net sales of $2.0 billion were a record in the period and represent an increase of 13% on a constant exchange rate basis and same days basis. Our adjusted quarterly operating income margin rose to 14% of sales, an increase of 260 basis points, due to productivity volume and lower cost. Every segment delivered sales growth on a comparable basis while also expanding margin.
I'll now review the fourth quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment net sales, adjusted for currency translation and days, rose 7% with adjusted operating income up 14% on a constant exchange rate basis. We continue to reap the benefits of our Marazzi and Kai acquisition. The combined R&D of our worldwide ceramic business has dramatically enhanced our style leadership, product technology and process enhancement. In addition, we're using our Italian, Bulgarian, Russian and Mexican ceramic capacity to support sales in the United States market. 
Our North American business makes up the majority of our ceramic segment. In the U.S. market, new home construction represented the most robust channel during the quarter, followed by commercial and residential remodeling. Our margins increased during the period as we improved our mix, enhanced our productivity and leveraged our overhead. We increased our sales investments to improve our market position by increasing service centers, expanding our sales personnel and upgrading our distribution. Our ceramic statements program, a store-within-a-store concept has grown to include 215 of our country's largest dealers and enhancing their sales and margin. We continue to improve our position in the home center channel with greater commitments for both floor and wall tile. 
Our American Olean and Marazzi brands are growing sales through partnerships with leading independent distributors and through our own co-branded service centers in markets without strong partners. We are increasing our product mix as we introduce higher-style products in larger sizes, planks, stone look, hexagons and bricks. We also are introducing large and small wall tiles with unique surface structures, which are now used as focal point in all areas of the home. 
We made significant progress in realigning our plants and production lines to specialize in different products, optimizing our productivity and service. Our new Tennessee porcelain plant is in the final stages of construction and should start up within the quarter. There will be 3 new kilns, which begin production during 2016, and we expect to fully benefit from these by 2017. The new plant will enhance our premium offering and replace products that we have historically imported, improving our service and cost. We have integrated the ceramic plant we acquired in Western Mexico and have improved its capacity and cost structures. Shipping from the facility should provide us advantages within the western part of the U.S. and Mexico. 
The Mexican economy is doing well, and the ceramic industry there grew by more than 15% in 2015. Due to the investments we made in Salamanca in 2012, we've been able to outpace market growth. We've dramatically expanded our product offering in all price points and have improved our margin and mix as we increased our market share. To continue this progress, we're planning to increase the capacity of our Salamanca plant to greater participate in the Central Mexico region that makes up 60% of the total market. 
Our European ceramic sales have been growing in a lackluster market. Our product mix has improved, as we introduced uniquely styled products and expanded our margins. We have successfully enhanced our product offering, and we're now expanding our sales force, introducing new merchandising and escalating our retail sales training. We anticipate completing the second phase of our equipment upgrades by the second quarter, which will further enhance our product offering and improve our cost structure. The third phase of equipment upgrades will begin the end of this year and complete our major investments to modernize the Marazzi assets we acquired in 2013. The optimization of our Bulgarian ceramic operation continues with a focus on improving our product offering. We have a strong management team in Bulgaria that is enhancing our internal processes and manufacturing method. We're improving our mix by increasing the use of digital designs and larger sizes, implementing more automation and supplying product to the U.S., Eastern Europe and other international markets.
In Russia, we gained market share in the period as sales increased and margins compressed. Our comparisons in the fourth quarter to first quarter will be difficult due to consumers accelerating purchases a year ago. We have outperformed the market due to our strong brand position, new styles and larger and smaller sizes and increased distribution in both the remodeling and new construction channels. We're expanding our porcelain capacity, which was fully utilized last year. 
Our North America segment's net sales were up 6% on an adjusted days basis with adjusted operating earnings expanding 31%. All of our product categories contributed to our growing profitability, and we are well positioned in each product category to take advantage of an improving U.S. market. The carpet industry's growth remains lower than the hard surface categories. Our profitability continues to increase, even though carpet sales were softer and pricing was impacted by price and mix pressure. We've taken many actions to optimize our business profitability, which is expanding with the business cycle. Our builders in multifamily residential business continue to outperform the remodeling channel. 
Sales of our premium carpet products, including our luxury Karastan brand and SmartStrand product collections grew during the period. We continue to introduce differentiated products with our SmartStrand Silk naturals collection, which replicates the appearance of wool with superior softness, texture performance. We further extended our SmartStrand family with our all-new all-pet protection, which enhances -- which has enhancements for cleaning up accidents. This collection was voted by retailers as the most innovative flooring product in the industry at the recent show in Las Vegas. 
We also enhanced our Continuum recycle polyester by introducing Forever Fresh carpets with odor-eliminating technology, which gives consumers another reason to trade up to Mohawk. We're continuing the expansion of our sales teams as well as increasing their specialization to maximize our participation in each end market. 
Our commercial margins continue to improve as a result of our new product introduction, streamlined manufacturing and plant consolidations. Our carpet tile sales are increasing as the market continues to expand and sales of our DuraColor-branded products are increasing through their premium performance characteristics. We've expanded the shapes and sizes of our carpet tiles, and we've introduced new collections with cushion that improve comfort and reduces noise. To extend our participation in value-oriented commercial carpet, we launched new collections made with our exclusive recycled Continuum polyester.
Our carpet operations continue the simplifications of our raw material components at manufacturing. Last year, we closed 10 plants and warehouses and several production lines. All of these actions are contributing to the improvement of our cost as well as the enhancement of our efficiency, quality and service levels. 
Our rug business continues to outperform the overall segment. Our new product innovation is creating more fashionable accent rugs made with our exclusive fibers, providing softer characteristics with greater value. We are entering new rug categories, including commercial and residential utility mats and flat woven outdoor rugs. 
Our North American laminate and wood business continues to improve as we enhance the differentiation of our products. We're expanding our new impressive laminate collection, which provides stylized looks unachievable in natural wood. We're increasing our laminate production with new technology to support these unique features. 
In addition to our best-in-class innovation, we also extended our design leadership by introducing newer longer and wider planks in both laminate and wood collections. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow, and we're planning new investments to support increased demand. We're launching unique Pergo branded collections in wood, laminate and LVT into the specialty retail channel to leverage one of the most recognized consumer brands in the flooring industry. The new Pergo products were debuted at the recent industry show and were enthusiastically received by the retail community.
The reorganization of our U.S. vinyl business has been completed with the former IVC management team directing the product offering and marketing strategies for all of our vinyl products and brands. Our IVC vinyl sales are performing as planned, and we're introducing sheet vinyl and LVT products into our Mohawk brands from our U.S. facility. 
Our new LVT plant continues to improve in performance with increased production. We anticipate that the present production line will be operating as-planned levels by the end of the year. LVT continues to take share in the U.S. flooring market as sales of the category expand across all channels and end uses. Our sales trends anticipate full utilization of our current LVT capacity, and we have announced investments to further increase our production and expand our product offering. 
We are also expanding our sheet vinyl business across other brands and leveraging our customer relationships to increase our market penetration. We're continuing to ramp up our Mohawk-branded sheet vinyl sales in builder multifamily and retail market. And we're developing new products to extend our sheet vinyl further into the commercial channel. 
Our flooring North America segment has made progress in expanding our brands and customer relationships, expanding our style and design, transferring innovative manufacturing practices and utilizing the Mohawk distribution for all products.
During the period, both sales and margins in our Flooring Rest of World segment rose dramatically in a muted economic environment due to improved results and the IVC acquisition. Our local -- on a local basis adjusted for days, net sales for the segment increased 41%. Adjusted operating income was 59% up on a constant exchange rate basis. The leadership for the Flooring Rest of the World segment has been reorganized to leverage sales, manufacturing and product management for the entire organization. 
Our new vinyl business is being holistically managed to optimize our asset distribution and best practices across the segment. Our laminate wood business in Europe outperformed the market as a result of our focus on differentiated products at mid- to high-end price points. Where we operate direct distribution, it has enhanced our market share and increased our penetration. We continue to expand our latest embossing technology, which creates more realistic visuals. We will further extend this technology in new larger planks to be launched later this year. To meet the growing demand, we're installing additional capacity this year. 
Our European wood sales are growing quickly, and we are taking market share. The Czech wood plant we acquired 2 years ago is operating near capacity with the balance of our product needs coming from a Malaysian facility. We're planning to expand our engineered wood capacity in the Czech Republic. 
The legacy IVC vinyl business is reaching full capacity. In sheet vinyl and LVT, we're achieving some capacity increases through process improvement. The new LVT plant in Belgium is operating well, and the sales are developing better than planned. This plant is temporarily constrained by manufacturing limitations, which will be addressed with additional equipment, increasing the capacity by 40% in the middle of this year. To meet current demand, we're importing LVT to supplement our capacity. And we're planning further investments to add a new LVT production line. We're continuing to develop new products in anticipation of these increased capabilities. 
Our installation business had record sales this year. We continue to enhance our distribution and manufacturing capability, including the addition of another production shift at our plant in France. At the end of the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 3 insulation board plants in Ireland, the U.K. and Belgium to expand our offering and geographic footprint. Our management structure has already been reorganized, and we're identifying opportunities to enhance all the operations. Our other board product sales were up slightly with margins improving from mix, asset upgrades and plant consolidations.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew",1029,"Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,998,000,000, up 2% as reported. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had 4 fewer days than we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew 13% or 4% excluding acquisitions. Foreign exchange reduced sales $86 million compared to last year. All segments grew on a legacy basis using a constant exchange rate basis -- constant exchange rate and days. Acquisitions and volume increases were the primary drivers. 
Our gross margin was 31.1% as reported. Excluding charges, the margin was 31.9%, up 360 basis points from last year. Higher volume, productivity and lower raw materials were the biggest contributors to this increase. 
Our SG&A as reported was $373 million or 18.7% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 18% of net sales, up from 17% last year. Fewer days in the quarter and investments back into SG&A moved the percent up from last year. Our focus on investments allowed for better sales growth as well as improved mix in the quarter. We anticipate the SG&A percentage improving to a lower number in 2016 as we leverage spending against sales growth. Unusual charges for the quarter were $28 million, with approximately $20 million associated with our acquisitions. The balance was due to restructuring actions in the North American flooring segment. 
For the full year, we had $212 million in nonrecurring expense, with $122 million of that related to a legal settlement, which by the way we believe was extortion; $70 million for acquisitions; and $17 million for restructuring of existing businesses. Of the acquisition cost, $8 million were for M&A fees; $14 million were for inventory step-ups related to purchase accounting; and $48 million for plant closures, manufacturing consolidations, administrative reductions and system upgrades, all to improve profitability.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 260 basis points, and our operating income would have been $12 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Interest expense was $18 million and showed improvement this year due to a premium paid last year on the early redemption of some of our bonds. 
Other expense was $12 million and includes a charge for unwinding an $11 million indemnification receivable recorded in the IVC purchase accounting earlier in the year. There's also an offsetting $11 million benefit included in tax expense as reported as the related liability was unwound. The income tax rate, excluding unusual items, for the quarter was 18.7%, compares to a 19% rate last year. We expect the first quarter rate in this year to be 25% and the full year rate for 2016 to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. And I'll remind you that our rate fluctuates by quarter, depending upon timing for certain tax deductions. Our earnings per share excluding charges was $2.82, which represents an increase of 24% over last year.
Turning to the segments. In the Global Ceramic segment, sales were $712 million, down 4% as reported. Using a constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business, it was up 4%. FX was a $45 million headwind in the quarter for this segment. All regions are up on a constant currency and days basis. Our operating income margin excluding charges were 13%. This expanded 150 basis points over last year. And operating income would have been $5 million higher using constant exchange rates. Productivity and improving mix were the biggest drivers of this increase. 
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $880 million. They were flat as reported but increased by 3% on a constant days basis for the legacy business. Hard surface products grew at a faster rate than soft surface. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 14.2%. That is up 340 basis points from last year, with productivity and input costs the biggest contributors to the improvement, partially offset by price and mix. Our team continues to produce better results through continuous improvements and innovative products. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $407 million, up 22% as reported or up 7% using constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business. This was unusually high due to laminate, wood, LVT and intellectual property sales, which we do not believe will continue in the next year. FX was a $42 million impact on revenues during the quarter. Our wood and vinyl flooring products both had strong quarters, and we believe they outperformed the industry. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 16.4%, up 240 basis points from last year. And operating income would have been $7 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Volume, productivity and input costs were the biggest drivers of growth here.
In 2015, we had operating income from our patents, which was $130 million and was higher than last year due to payments for past due fees. We expect 2016 to be 5% to 10% lower. After June 2017, when the UniClic patents expire, we estimate annualized operating income of $30 million to $35 million from other patents. In addition, over the next few years, we'll benefit from internal investments, both current and future acquisitions and lower interest cost.
So if we turn to the balance sheet, receivables ended the year at $1.3 billion, with days sales outstanding at 55 days compared to 54 days last year. These days in the current year were slightly impacted by a change in channel mix. Inventories ended the year at $1.6 billion. Our inventory days continued to show strong improvement at 112 days for the quarter compared to last year's 116 days. Fixed assets were $3.1 billion and includes fourth quarter capital expenditures of $152 million and depreciation and amortization of $94 million. Capital expenditures for the full year were $504 million with D&A of $363 million. We estimate $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for 2016, with depreciation and amortization estimated at $400 million for 2016. Long-term debt was $3.2 billion at the end of the year. Our leverage ended the year at 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff for concluding remarks."

Our sales and margin should continue to improve over last year as a result of our continued innovations, process improvement and disciplined execution. Our recent acquisitions are progressing with operational market synergy as we anticipated.  This year, we will increase investments on our existing businesses to optimize our long-term performance. 
Taking these factors into account, our guidance for the first quarter is $2.24 to $2.33 per share. That would be a 32% to 37% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges. We have taken many actions to outperform the industry in each of our products and geographies over the past few years, and we'll continue to benefit from those strategies this year. In 2016, we'll continue to execute creative product ideas along with substantial investments to optimize our long-term results.

In the carpet business, we believe that our focus on new innovative products is expanding our position within the marketplace. We are dramatically cutting the cost structures we have to improve margin in what's going to be a lower-growth business. In the rug business, we're going into new product categories that we weren't in as well as we've introduced new products. In the ceramic business in North America, we're the leader in offering a total broad product line in all categories. We're putting new investments in that allow us to make products that the majority of the people in the United States can't and give us leading positions in style and design. In Mexico, we're expanding from a relatively small base. We had success in filling up a brand new plant from 2012, and at this moment, we're planning to double the size of that plant again this year to take advantage of our expanding distribution in the marketplace. In Europe, the ceramic business has been limited growth, but through our investments, we've been able to significantly cut the cost. And at the same time, we've been able to bring new product innovation to the marketplace, which is allowing us to grow in a low-growth market. But our primary objective was we bought the business that was not profitable and expand the margins, but there is some increase in capacity as we go through. The new acquisition with Kai, they have a high position in their market share in their markets. We're continuing to support them to optimize that business through improving the mix and giving them opportunities to sell product outside their local region with all our other sales and marketing people across the country. The Russian business, we're growing market share significantly as the market declined, last year our volume was flat or up a little bit in a marketplace that was declining significantly. We've been able to do that through -- we have the leading style and design in the marketplace. We're the best option for high-style product that used to be imported out of Italy, which we can make in there. Our high-end ceramic capacity was fully utilized last year, and we're actually increasing our capacity in Russia in a market that's horrible. At the same time, we're using the strength of our business to increase the distribution into the various channels and optimize our brand. Moving back into the Flooring Rest of The world, our laminate, we focus on medium to high in Europe. We have brought unique product innovation to the marketplace, which we started introducing last year. We've extended it this year. We have run out of capacity in that category, which is being installed the first of this year so that we can keep growing that, which is very unique. We have multiple brands in the marketplace, which we go after, different channels of the marketplace. The acquisition of IVC brought us another brand that's focused on a lower-price category than the other ones we have. So we're using it to expand our distribution across the marketplace, but still not in the commodity areas. The wood business, we still have a limited portion of a very large market. And because of that, we have focused on again the medium to high end. We have been able to add value to the marketplace. We bought the ceramic business in Czech 2 years ago, I think, and it's running full, and we're planning on expanding it to give us opportunities to grow further. The IVC business, we're managing through the changes, and I mean, doing well. As their sales to Russia declined, we put those in the other marketplace. We think we're going to be pushing the limits of the capacity in sheet vinyl. In LVT, the 2 plants that we have are selling everything they can make. The newer plant, which is the one that we started building before them, they've helped us optimize. And by the middle of the year, we will increase the capacity by about another 40%. We have planned to put another line in our facilities over there to grow further in the marketplace in LVT. And then we have our other -- our insulation board business. We had 2 plants that we greenfielded both. The first one has been running at full capacity. The second one is in France. We're adding another shift to it as we speak. And then we've purchased another business that had different geographic presence as well as slightly different products in it. And then our board businesses, we've spent money consolidating those and increasing the capacity limited, but it's more a cost savings and closing plants, and we should get most of those benefits during this year."

So we had gone into it with 1 plant and we were working to start it up. And in a limited period of time with them, we've been able to ramp it up to where it is and the plant is utilizing all we can make and it's expanding further and we believe that we can sell all of that in Europe. In addition to the United States, the plant that they had constructed, we have significant commitments from people to use the capacity. The market in the U.S. and Europe, collectively, is growing about 15%. In the U.S., that's about $200 million a year of new capacity coming into the marketplace and we think we're best positioned to provide the products to the marketplace, and we're well prepared to compete with the imported products coming in with higher style and value that's required to compete. And at the same time, we believe we can bring better local service to the marketplace, we can bring better product innovation to the marketplace and we don't have to fight the FX volatility. We believe the market can absorb it and we're going to be the leader in it."

I'm kind of thinking about your North American distribution and sales network in the context of 2 realities that I've been thinking about. First, there's been a quantum leap in recent years with respect to visual productions, the ability to achieve visuals and it's allowed customers to achieve remarkably similar looks across a variety of flooring materials. And the second thing is that Mohawk seems to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this convergence or flexibility in design across many, many different products given that you're a major manufacturer of all of these products and nobody else really is. 
So I guess, kind of a 2-part question with that. One, do you think longer term that the improved visuals is going to introduce negative mix shift as people sort of achieve those visuals with cheaper materials? Or instead, you think it's going to lead to a desire on the part of consumers to spend more money, more of their design dollars on the floor given the innovation? 
And the second question is what are some of the unique ways you can use across product sales and marketing strategy to get better profits and so in ways that your competitors simply can't because they don't make all those flooring materials?"

The first answer to your question, which was an either/or is a yes. And the yes means that in some of my product category -- in all my product categories, having better design and better features you can get a premium for, which you hear us talking about all the time. On the other hand, by having better looks and different product categories, in my personal view, which I can't say everybody agrees with me, is like wood that sells at higher prices, I think given there's more alternatives for wood, there's a possibility that people use those in place of wood and those things they're using are lower priced and I have no idea how the mix is going to change between the categories and neither does anybody else. On the use of our various assets, it is a huge benefit because all the similar looks are selling at all the different product categories and we are unique in having capabilities between laminate, wood, vinyl and ceramic that the same technology and same style and design, still all of them. And then with the acquisition we have of Marazzi, the Italians with style and design are way ahead of the rest of the world we'll use that to apply to every other one. And then I have to tell you we get ideas from our Russian business is different than it. They come up with different ideas and we have meetings where we put the different groups together and they all go about it in different ways and it gives us a unique perspective not only by product but by worldwide geographies that ideas transfer back and forth and I think that puts us in a unique position that nobody else can compete with."

First I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income e",2759,"Thank you, Frank. First I'll begin with a review of our results for the past year. We delivered record annual sales of $8.1 billion, growing 10% on a constant exchange basis and record adjusted earnings per share of $10.20. Our adjusted operating income exceeded $1 billion and improved 26% compared to 2014. Last year, we achieved record earnings per share in each quarter, with about 30% of our business outside the United States where we faced significant foreign exchange headwind. If adjusted for exchange rate changes, our 2015 net sales would have been $490 million higher, an impact of approximately 6%. And our operating income would've been $74 million higher, a 9% impact. 
Our strong performance was a result of aggressive growth strategy and targeted investments we began in 2013 as the economic recovery gained momentum. Since that time, we've invested almost $5 billion, of which about $3.5 billion was in 9 acquisitions to expand our products, geographies and market share, and about $1.5 billion was in our existing businesses to introduce innovative products, enhance manufacturing efficiencies and expand our capability.
While making these investments for future growth, we improved our balance sheet and reduced our leverage, enabling us to optimize our returns. We remain optimistic about 2016 and will invest in additional $600 million to $650 million in internal projects this year, which include increased ceramic capacity and upgrades in our U.S., Mexico, Europe and Russia; process improvements in carpet manufacturing; additional LVT manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe; increased wood production in the U.S. and Europe; and installation of advanced technology in our laminate businesses.
During 2015, we changed our organizational structure to create 3 segments: Global Ceramic, Flooring North America; and Flooring Rest of the World. This restructuring has enabled us to optimize our assets, leverage our customer relationships and transfer best practices to maximize our profitability. By fostering greater interaction between our teams, we delivered innovative new products, increased collaboration among our sales groups and improved productivity in costs across our global organization. 
Last year as a result of continuous improvement, we closed all or part of 13 plants and warehouses across the enterprise to streamline the business. Over the past year, we completed 4 acquisitions. The IVC Group is a major fully integrated vinyl flooring manufacturer that provides Mohawk with leading positions in the U.S. and Europe in both sheet vinyl and luxury tile. Kai extended our leading position in ceramic tile into Eastern Europe. The acquisition of a ceramic plant in Northwest Mexico provided a new supply strategy, giving us advantages in the Western U.S. and Mexico. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the 3 plants to expand our European installation board business.
In 2015, to support future growth, we expanded our capacities in ceramic tile, polyester carpet, LVT and premium laminate. In our higher-growth products and geographies, we increased investments in new product samples and merchandising systems as well as sales personnel to increase our market penetration. Our results reflect the great work of a deep and talented management team that concurrently executed complex initiatives across multiple product categories and geographies. 
Despite some moderation in the U.S. economy during the fourth quarter, we're entering 2016 with cautious optimism based on a number of leading indicators, including a healthy consumer with rising household spending, low gasoline prices and improving unemployment rate. With mortgage rates remaining at historic lows, 2015 existing home sales rose more than 6% year-over-year. The National Association of Home Builders reported that new single-family home construction rose last year to the highest level since 2007 with expectations for continued gains in 2016. Rising home values accelerated housing turnover. And the aging of the country's residential infrastructure will continue to affect home improvement investments, which Harvard's LIRA Index predicts will surpass the previous peak of 2006. The American Institute of Architects correctly predicted solid growth in commercial construction in 2015 and forecasts continued commercial growth in 2016, with hotel and office space leading the category. 
Low oil prices are expected to keep the Russian economy in recession through 2016. The Mexican economy is benefiting from low unemployment, strong consumer activity from -- and government reforms that are improving the construction in the country. The European Central Bank's quantitative easing program is providing stimulus for growth in the region, and most economists are predicting modest gains for the eurozone in 2016.
Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Our record adjusted earnings per share rose 24% to $2.82, even as we increased investments to improve future results. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter with record adjusted earnings per share. Our net sales of $2.0 billion were a record in the period and represent an increase of 13% on a constant exchange rate basis and same days basis. Our adjusted quarterly operating income margin rose to 14% of sales, an increase of 260 basis points, due to productivity volume and lower cost. Every segment delivered sales growth on a comparable basis while also expanding margin.
I'll now review the fourth quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment net sales, adjusted for currency translation and days, rose 7% with adjusted operating income up 14% on a constant exchange rate basis. We continue to reap the benefits of our Marazzi and Kai acquisition. The combined R&D of our worldwide ceramic business has dramatically enhanced our style leadership, product technology and process enhancement. In addition, we're using our Italian, Bulgarian, Russian and Mexican ceramic capacity to support sales in the United States market. 
Our North American business makes up the majority of our ceramic segment. In the U.S. market, new home construction represented the most robust channel during the quarter, followed by commercial and residential remodeling. Our margins increased during the period as we improved our mix, enhanced our productivity and leveraged our overhead. We increased our sales investments to improve our market position by increasing service centers, expanding our sales personnel and upgrading our distribution. Our ceramic statements program, a store-within-a-store concept has grown to include 215 of our country's largest dealers and enhancing their sales and margin. We continue to improve our position in the home center channel with greater commitments for both floor and wall tile. 
Our American Olean and Marazzi brands are growing sales through partnerships with leading independent distributors and through our own co-branded service centers in markets without strong partners. We are increasing our product mix as we introduce higher-style products in larger sizes, planks, stone look, hexagons and bricks. We also are introducing large and small wall tiles with unique surface structures, which are now used as focal point in all areas of the home. 
We made significant progress in realigning our plants and production lines to specialize in different products, optimizing our productivity and service. Our new Tennessee porcelain plant is in the final stages of construction and should start up within the quarter. There will be 3 new kilns, which begin production during 2016, and we expect to fully benefit from these by 2017. The new plant will enhance our premium offering and replace products that we have historically imported, improving our service and cost. We have integrated the ceramic plant we acquired in Western Mexico and have improved its capacity and cost structures. Shipping from the facility should provide us advantages within the western part of the U.S. and Mexico. 
The Mexican economy is doing well, and the ceramic industry there grew by more than 15% in 2015. Due to the investments we made in Salamanca in 2012, we've been able to outpace market growth. We've dramatically expanded our product offering in all price points and have improved our margin and mix as we increased our market share. To continue this progress, we're planning to increase the capacity of our Salamanca plant to greater participate in the Central Mexico region that makes up 60% of the total market. 
Our European ceramic sales have been growing in a lackluster market. Our product mix has improved, as we introduced uniquely styled products and expanded our margins. We have successfully enhanced our product offering, and we're now expanding our sales force, introducing new merchandising and escalating our retail sales training. We anticipate completing the second phase of our equipment upgrades by the second quarter, which will further enhance our product offering and improve our cost structure. The third phase of equipment upgrades will begin the end of this year and complete our major investments to modernize the Marazzi assets we acquired in 2013. The optimization of our Bulgarian ceramic operation continues with a focus on improving our product offering. We have a strong management team in Bulgaria that is enhancing our internal processes and manufacturing method. We're improving our mix by increasing the use of digital designs and larger sizes, implementing more automation and supplying product to the U.S., Eastern Europe and other international markets.
In Russia, we gained market share in the period as sales increased and margins compressed. Our comparisons in the fourth quarter to first quarter will be difficult due to consumers accelerating purchases a year ago. We have outperformed the market due to our strong brand position, new styles and larger and smaller sizes and increased distribution in both the remodeling and new construction channels. We're expanding our porcelain capacity, which was fully utilized last year. 
Our North America segment's net sales were up 6% on an adjusted days basis with adjusted operating earnings expanding 31%. All of our product categories contributed to our growing profitability, and we are well positioned in each product category to take advantage of an improving U.S. market. The carpet industry's growth remains lower than the hard surface categories. Our profitability continues to increase, even though carpet sales were softer and pricing was impacted by price and mix pressure. We've taken many actions to optimize our business profitability, which is expanding with the business cycle. Our builders in multifamily residential business continue to outperform the remodeling channel. 
Sales of our premium carpet products, including our luxury Karastan brand and SmartStrand product collections grew during the period. We continue to introduce differentiated products with our SmartStrand Silk naturals collection, which replicates the appearance of wool with superior softness, texture performance. We further extended our SmartStrand family with our all-new all-pet protection, which enhances -- which has enhancements for cleaning up accidents. This collection was voted by retailers as the most innovative flooring product in the industry at the recent show in Las Vegas. 
We also enhanced our Continuum recycle polyester by introducing Forever Fresh carpets with odor-eliminating technology, which gives consumers another reason to trade up to Mohawk. We're continuing the expansion of our sales teams as well as increasing their specialization to maximize our participation in each end market. 
Our commercial margins continue to improve as a result of our new product introduction, streamlined manufacturing and plant consolidations. Our carpet tile sales are increasing as the market continues to expand and sales of our DuraColor-branded products are increasing through their premium performance characteristics. We've expanded the shapes and sizes of our carpet tiles, and we've introduced new collections with cushion that improve comfort and reduces noise. To extend our participation in value-oriented commercial carpet, we launched new collections made with our exclusive recycled Continuum polyester.
Our carpet operations continue the simplifications of our raw material components at manufacturing. Last year, we closed 10 plants and warehouses and several production lines. All of these actions are contributing to the improvement of our cost as well as the enhancement of our efficiency, quality and service levels. 
Our rug business continues to outperform the overall segment. Our new product innovation is creating more fashionable accent rugs made with our exclusive fibers, providing softer characteristics with greater value. We are entering new rug categories, including commercial and residential utility mats and flat woven outdoor rugs. 
Our North American laminate and wood business continues to improve as we enhance the differentiation of our products. We're expanding our new impressive laminate collection, which provides stylized looks unachievable in natural wood. We're increasing our laminate production with new technology to support these unique features. 
In addition to our best-in-class innovation, we also extended our design leadership by introducing newer longer and wider planks in both laminate and wood collections. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow, and we're planning new investments to support increased demand. We're launching unique Pergo branded collections in wood, laminate and LVT into the specialty retail channel to leverage one of the most recognized consumer brands in the flooring industry. The new Pergo products were debuted at the recent industry show and were enthusiastically received by the retail community.
The reorganization of our U.S. vinyl business has been completed with the former IVC management team directing the product offering and marketing strategies for all of our vinyl products and brands. Our IVC vinyl sales are performing as planned, and we're introducing sheet vinyl and LVT products into our Mohawk brands from our U.S. facility. 
Our new LVT plant continues to improve in performance with increased production. We anticipate that the present production line will be operating as-planned levels by the end of the year. LVT continues to take share in the U.S. flooring market as sales of the category expand across all channels and end uses. Our sales trends anticipate full utilization of our current LVT capacity, and we have announced investments to further increase our production and expand our product offering. 
We are also expanding our sheet vinyl business across other brands and leveraging our customer relationships to increase our market penetration. We're continuing to ramp up our Mohawk-branded sheet vinyl sales in builder multifamily and retail market. And we're developing new products to extend our sheet vinyl further into the commercial channel. 
Our flooring North America segment has made progress in expanding our brands and customer relationships, expanding our style and design, transferring innovative manufacturing practices and utilizing the Mohawk distribution for all products.
During the period, both sales and margins in our Flooring Rest of World segment rose dramatically in a muted economic environment due to improved results and the IVC acquisition. Our local -- on a local basis adjusted for days, net sales for the segment increased 41%. Adjusted operating income was 59% up on a constant exchange rate basis. The leadership for the Flooring Rest of the World segment has been reorganized to leverage sales, manufacturing and product management for the entire organization. 
Our new vinyl business is being holistically managed to optimize our asset distribution and best practices across the segment. Our laminate wood business in Europe outperformed the market as a result of our focus on differentiated products at mid- to high-end price points. Where we operate direct distribution, it has enhanced our market share and increased our penetration. We continue to expand our latest embossing technology, which creates more realistic visuals. We will further extend this technology in new larger planks to be launched later this year. To meet the growing demand, we're installing additional capacity this year. 
Our European wood sales are growing quickly, and we are taking market share. The Czech wood plant we acquired 2 years ago is operating near capacity with the balance of our product needs coming from a Malaysian facility. We're planning to expand our engineered wood capacity in the Czech Republic. 
The legacy IVC vinyl business is reaching full capacity. In sheet vinyl and LVT, we're achieving some capacity increases through process improvement. The new LVT plant in Belgium is operating well, and the sales are developing better than planned. This plant is temporarily constrained by manufacturing limitations, which will be addressed with additional equipment, increasing the capacity by 40% in the middle of this year. To meet current demand, we're importing LVT to supplement our capacity. And we're planning further investments to add a new LVT production line. We're continuing to develop new products in anticipation of these increased capabilities. 
Our installation business had record sales this year. We continue to enhance our distribution and manufacturing capability, including the addition of another production shift at our plant in France. At the end of the quarter, we finalized the acquisition of 3 insulation board plants in Ireland, the U.K. and Belgium to expand our offering and geographic footprint. Our management structure has already been reorganized, and we're identifying opportunities to enhance all the operations. Our other board product sales were up slightly with margins improving from mix, asset upgrades and plant consolidations.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."
31670,321982204,943216,"Mohawk Industries Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Mohawk Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff.

Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew",1029,"Thank you, Jeff. Net sales for the quarter were $1,998,000,000, up 2% as reported. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we had 4 fewer days than we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Our constant FX on -- on a constant FX and days basis, our sales grew 13% or 4% excluding acquisitions. Foreign exchange reduced sales $86 million compared to last year. All segments grew on a legacy basis using a constant exchange rate basis -- constant exchange rate and days. Acquisitions and volume increases were the primary drivers. 
Our gross margin was 31.1% as reported. Excluding charges, the margin was 31.9%, up 360 basis points from last year. Higher volume, productivity and lower raw materials were the biggest contributors to this increase. 
Our SG&A as reported was $373 million or 18.7% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 18% of net sales, up from 17% last year. Fewer days in the quarter and investments back into SG&A moved the percent up from last year. Our focus on investments allowed for better sales growth as well as improved mix in the quarter. We anticipate the SG&A percentage improving to a lower number in 2016 as we leverage spending against sales growth. Unusual charges for the quarter were $28 million, with approximately $20 million associated with our acquisitions. The balance was due to restructuring actions in the North American flooring segment. 
For the full year, we had $212 million in nonrecurring expense, with $122 million of that related to a legal settlement, which by the way we believe was extortion; $70 million for acquisitions; and $17 million for restructuring of existing businesses. Of the acquisition cost, $8 million were for M&A fees; $14 million were for inventory step-ups related to purchase accounting; and $48 million for plant closures, manufacturing consolidations, administrative reductions and system upgrades, all to improve profitability.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 13.9%, up 260 basis points, and our operating income would have been $12 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Interest expense was $18 million and showed improvement this year due to a premium paid last year on the early redemption of some of our bonds. 
Other expense was $12 million and includes a charge for unwinding an $11 million indemnification receivable recorded in the IVC purchase accounting earlier in the year. There's also an offsetting $11 million benefit included in tax expense as reported as the related liability was unwound. The income tax rate, excluding unusual items, for the quarter was 18.7%, compares to a 19% rate last year. We expect the first quarter rate in this year to be 25% and the full year rate for 2016 to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. And I'll remind you that our rate fluctuates by quarter, depending upon timing for certain tax deductions. Our earnings per share excluding charges was $2.82, which represents an increase of 24% over last year.
Turning to the segments. In the Global Ceramic segment, sales were $712 million, down 4% as reported. Using a constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business, it was up 4%. FX was a $45 million headwind in the quarter for this segment. All regions are up on a constant currency and days basis. Our operating income margin excluding charges were 13%. This expanded 150 basis points over last year. And operating income would have been $5 million higher using constant exchange rates. Productivity and improving mix were the biggest drivers of this increase. 
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $880 million. They were flat as reported but increased by 3% on a constant days basis for the legacy business. Hard surface products grew at a faster rate than soft surface. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 14.2%. That is up 340 basis points from last year, with productivity and input costs the biggest contributors to the improvement, partially offset by price and mix. Our team continues to produce better results through continuous improvements and innovative products. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $407 million, up 22% as reported or up 7% using constant exchange rate and days for our legacy business. This was unusually high due to laminate, wood, LVT and intellectual property sales, which we do not believe will continue in the next year. FX was a $42 million impact on revenues during the quarter. Our wood and vinyl flooring products both had strong quarters, and we believe they outperformed the industry. Our operating income margin excluding charges was 16.4%, up 240 basis points from last year. And operating income would have been $7 million higher using a constant exchange rate. Volume, productivity and input costs were the biggest drivers of growth here.
In 2015, we had operating income from our patents, which was $130 million and was higher than last year due to payments for past due fees. We expect 2016 to be 5% to 10% lower. After June 2017, when the UniClic patents expire, we estimate annualized operating income of $30 million to $35 million from other patents. In addition, over the next few years, we'll benefit from internal investments, both current and future acquisitions and lower interest cost.
So if we turn to the balance sheet, receivables ended the year at $1.3 billion, with days sales outstanding at 55 days compared to 54 days last year. These days in the current year were slightly impacted by a change in channel mix. Inventories ended the year at $1.6 billion. Our inventory days continued to show strong improvement at 112 days for the quarter compared to last year's 116 days. Fixed assets were $3.1 billion and includes fourth quarter capital expenditures of $152 million and depreciation and amortization of $94 million. Capital expenditures for the full year were $504 million with D&A of $363 million. We estimate $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for 2016, with depreciation and amortization estimated at $400 million for 2016. Long-term debt was $3.2 billion at the end of the year. Our leverage ended the year at 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff for concluding remarks."

We anticipate that the demand trends in our U.S. and international markets remain consistent with what we have been experiencing. Though growth in Europe is limited and negative in Russia, our international businesses are delivering solid results on a local basis. Our sales and margin should continue to improve over last year as a result of our continued innovations, process improvement and disciplined execution. Our recent acquisitions are progressing with operational market synergy as we anticipated. This year, we will increase investments on our existing businesses to optimize our long-term performance. 
Taking these factors into account, our guidance for the first quarter is $2.24 to $2.33 per share. That would be a 32% to 37% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges. We have taken many actions to outperform the industry in each of our products and geographies over the past few years, and we'll continue to benefit from those strategies this year. In 2016, we'll continue to execute creative product ideas along with substantial investments to optimize our long-term results.
We'll now be glad to answer any question."

In the carpet business, we believe that our focus on new innovative products is expanding our position within the marketplace. We are dramatically cutting the cost structures we have to improve margin in what's going to be a lower-growth business. In the rug business, we're going into new product categories that we weren't in as well as we've introduced new products. In the ceramic business in North America, we're the leader in offering a total broad product line in all categories. We're putting new investments in that allow us to make products that the majority of the people in the United States can't and give us leading positions in style and design. In Mexico, we're expanding from a relatively small base. We had success in filling up a brand new plant from 2012, and at this moment, we're planning to double the size of that plant again this year to take advantage of our expanding distribution in the marketplace. In Europe, the ceramic business has been limited growth, but through our investments, we've been able to significantly cut the cost. And at the same time, we've been able to bring new product innovation to the marketplace, which is allowing us to grow in a low-growth market. But our primary objective was we bought the business that was not profitable and expand the margins, but there is some increase in capacity as we go through. The new acquisition with Kai, they have a high position in their market share in their markets. We're continuing to support them to optimize that business through improving the mix and giving them opportunities to sell product outside their local region with all our other sales and marketing people across the country. The Russian business, we're growing market share significantly as the market declined, last year our volume was flat or up a little bit in a marketplace that was declining significantly. We've been able to do that through -- we have the leading style and design in the marketplace. We're the best option for high-style product that used to be imported out of Italy, which we can make in there. Our high-end ceramic capacity was fully utilized last year, and we're actually increasing our capacity in Russia in a market that's horrible. At the same time, we're using the strength of our business to increase the distribution into the various channels and optimize our brand. Moving back into the Flooring Rest of The world, our laminate, we focus on medium to high in Europe. We have brought unique product innovation to the marketplace, which we started introducing last year. We've extended it this year. We have run out of capacity in that category, which is being installed the first of this year so that we can keep growing that, which is very unique. We have multiple brands in the marketplace, which we go after, different channels of the marketplace. The acquisition of IVC brought us another brand that's focused on a lower-price category than the other ones we have. So we're using it to expand our distribution across the marketplace, but still not in the commodity areas. The wood business, we still have a limited portion of a very large market. And because of that, we have focused on again the medium to high end. We have been able to add value to the marketplace. We bought the ceramic business in Czech 2 years ago, I think, and it's running full, and we're planning on expanding it to give us opportunities to grow further. The IVC business, we're managing through the changes, and I mean, doing well. As their sales to Russia declined, we put those in the other marketplace. We think we're going to be pushing the limits of the capacity in sheet vinyl. In LVT, the 2 plants that we have are selling everything they can make. The newer plant, which is the one that we started building before them, they've helped us optimize. And by the middle of the year, we will increase the capacity by about another 40%. We have planned to put another line in our facilities over there to grow further in the marketplace in LVT. And then we have our other -- our insulation board business. We had 2 plants that we greenfielded both. The first one has been running at full capacity. The second one is in France. We're adding another shift to it as we speak. And then we've purchased another business that had different geographic presence as well as slightly different products in it. And then our board businesses, we've spent money consolidating those and increasing the capacity limited, but it's more a cost savings and closing plants, and we should get most of those benefits during this year."

I think one of the things that's lost on some people is that Unilin didn't have just good invention, but they developed the intellectual capital to be able to monetize their patent and so they kind of have a platform with which they can monetize other patents. And so my question is what's the prospects for you to be able to grow from your base of $30 million to $35 million, excluding UniClic? Is it mostly dependent upon new patents that you would have to file? Or do you think you'll be able to grow, let's say, advisory fees from helping third parties monetize their patents kind of like you did recently with your Novalis relationship."

We think that we have the right things in place to execute that. You are correct, we have unique knowledge in how to manage and create value for patents. But having something that's unique that's salable, I mean, it's not that easy or everybody would have it. So we think that the $30 million to $35 million is what we know of today.

I'm kind of thinking about your North American distribution and sales network in the context of 2 realities that I've been thinking about. First, there's been a quantum leap in recent years with respect to visual productions, the ability to achieve visuals and it's allowed customers to achieve remarkably similar looks across a variety of flooring materials. And the second thing is that Mohawk seems to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this convergence or flexibility in design across many, many different products given that you're a major manufacturer of all of these products and nobody else really is. 
So I guess, kind of a 2-part question with that. One, do you think longer term that the improved visuals is going to introduce negative mix shift as people sort of achieve those visuals with cheaper materials? Or instead, you think it's going to lead to a desire on the part of consumers to spend more money, more of their design dollars on the floor given the innovation? 
And the second question is what are some of the unique ways you can use across product sales and marketing strategy to get better profits and so in ways that your competitors simply can't because they don't make all those flooring materials?"

The first answer to your question, which was an either/or is a yes. And the yes means that in some of my product category -- in all my product categories, having better design and better features you can get a premium for, which you hear us talking about all the time. On the other hand, by having better looks and different product categories, in my personal view, which I can't say everybody agrees with me, is like wood that sells at higher prices, I think given there's more alternatives for wood, there's a possibility that people use those in place of wood and those things they're using are lower priced and I have no idea how the mix is going to change between the categories and neither does anybody else. On the use of our various assets, it is a huge benefit because all the similar looks are selling at all the different product categories and we are unique in having capabilities between laminate, wood, vinyl and ceramic that the same technology and same style and design, still all of them. And then with the acquisition we have of Marazzi, the Italians with style and design are way ahead of the rest of the world we'll use that to apply to every other one. And then I have to tell you we get ideas from our Russian business is different than it. They come up with different ideas and we have meetings where we put the different groups together and they all go about it in different ways and it gives us a unique perspective not only by product but by worldwide geographies that ideas transfer back and forth and I think that puts us in a unique position that nobody else can compete with."

During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges. An increase of 40% over the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's history. This is the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company has delivered record adjusted EPS. For the period, our adjusted operating margin rose to a first quarter record of 11.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year as a result of acquisitions, volume, productivity and input costs. Revenues grew across all segments with first quarter net sales increasing 15.5% as reported to $2.2 billion, the highest sales figure we have ever reported for any quarter. All of these results were achieved with one less day in the period than last year. 
We entered 2016 with an optimistic outlook, and our first quarter results exceeded our projections with strong results from all 3 of our segments in both revenues and margins. Our recent acquisitions continue to improve our performance with the synergies enhancing our existing and acquired businesses and lower impact of the U.S. dollar benefited our results. After completing 4 acquisitions during 2015, we have the capacity to absorb additional opportunities if they become available. 
Our major capital projects initiated last year are progressing as expected with the first production line at our Tennessee ceramic plant now operational. Our U.S. LVT production accelerating, the second phase of our European ceramic upgrade now complete. Each of our capital expansion projects create significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take 1 to 3 years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results. 
In 2016, we have identified more opportunities to grow our business and have already approved additional LVT production lines in the U.S. and Europe, the doubling of our Mexican ceramic plant in Central Mexico, the final phase of our European ceramic upgrades and the expansion of our U.S. and European premium laminate production with new technology. We anticipate investing more than $600 million in capital projects this year, and we are assessing further internal opportunity.
Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single home family market. With home prices rising and existing home sales strong, the Harvard LIRA index is forecasting residential remodeling to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. In April, home improvement survey indicated that half of U.S. homeowners are planning remodeling investments this year, and new flooring was the second most common project being anticipated. The consensus among commercial construction forecast is for continued growth during 2016 with hospitality and office space sectors leading the category. 
In Mexico, government spending has benefited the country's construction sector, which continues to drive high ceramic growth. In Europe, the Central Bank's latest round of interest rate reductions and asset purchase program are supporting the region's economy. The Russian economy remains in a recession with continued pressures from low oil prices. In 2016, we're investing in all of these markets to position Mohawk for future growth.
Turning to a review of our first quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment sales were up approximately 8% as reported. On a constant days days and currency basis, the segment grew 11% with the legacy business up almost 9%. Adjusted for operating income for the segment, it rose 18% on a constant currency basis over last year to an operating margin of 13%. Our North American ceramic business, which constitutes the majority of the segment, reflects a strong U.S. market where U.S. ceramic continues to gain shares. Our business, through our service centers, grew the fastest of all our channels during the period as we invested more in sales personnel, marketing and new product introductions. Within that channel, the combined American and service centers have the highest rate of growth as our consolidated approach expense our customer base. We're continuing to upgrade our showrooms lab warehouses and aggressively promoting business through user-friendly websites and social media. Throughout our network of almost 300 service centers, we're rolling out paperless sales and operation processes to improve customer service and enhance efficiencies. We continue to expand our independent distributor base, which will improve our penetration in the market. Our new floor wall tile products are gaining additional placements in the home center channel as those retailers place greater emphasis on the category. Our new product innovations in wood and stone looks as well as smaller shapes are growing our business and winning industry awards. To support our growth, our new plant in Tennessee initiated production on schedule, and the first line is running well. The plant's remaining 2 lines will be operational between now and August. To satisfy increased demand in the U.S, we are utilizing our worldwide ceramic asset in Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria and Russia to support our domestic production. Our Mexican ceramic business is outpacing the market and is the fastest-growing part of the segment. Our mix and margins continue to improve as we expand our distribution. The plant we acquired in Western Mexico last year is operating well and continue to improve its productivity and cost position. We're finalizing the expansion plans to double the ceramic plant near Mexico City with construction beginning in the second quarter. We're continuing to increase our customer base in the market, adding new distributors, expanding home center placements and increasing our participation in new construction projects. All of our plants in Mexico are improving their productivity and quality as we introduce larger sizes as well as specialized shapes. 
Our European ceramic business continues to improve in line with our plan with sales growing in the first period. We are increasing our investments in sales personnel, merchandising, retail training and brand advertising to enhance our distribution. The second phase of our equipment upgrades have been installed and is operational, improving our cost and service levels. Additional investments have been improved to modernize the balance of the original assets that we acquired in 2013. We continue to introduce innovative products that will expand our margins, including stone looks, thin and three-dimensional wall tiles and cement designs. 
Our Kai acquisition continues to progress as we enhance the product offering organization and reporting systems while expanding sales to Western Europe and the U.S. Our Russian ceramic business continues to outperform the market, which remains challenging as the economy contracts and investments in real estate decline. Our sales during the first quarter increased on a local basis, while our margins narrowed due to inflation and lower mix. We're introducing many new products and strategically opening own and franchised stores. We're implementing equipment upgrades to optimize our manufacturing of new sizes, and this new production line will expand our premium offerings. We continue to approach the market aggressively, which will enhance our position when the Russian economy rebounds.
During the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7% as reported. On a constant days basis, the segment grew approximately 9% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 42% over last year to an operating margin of approximately 9%. Our first quarter adjusted profit margin for the segment improved as a result of process efficiencies, investment in new technology, differentiated new products and cost improvements. Last year, we began expanding our investments in sales personnel and marketing to broaden our distribution in carpet and hard surface products. To optimize their performance, our sales organizations are specialized by both product and channel, and we are supporting them with greater sampling, merchandising and retail training. 
Our hard surface products continue to deliver substantial growth as we expand our market share as consumer flooring preferences shift. Growth in value-priced polyester carpet and lower-commodity pricing are reducing our average selling prices as lower raw material costs are reflected in the market. Despite these pricing pressures, the investments we made last year to differentiate our products and reduce our manufacturing costs are improving our margins. As a reflection of our investment in product innovation, [indiscernible] March collections won all 3 major dealer awards at the national trade shows. We continue to build on our strengths in premium residential carpet with innovative products such as continuum polyester with odor-eliminating technology and silk naturals, which replicates wool with the superior softness, texture and durability. These introductions are being well received by retailers and should enhance our mix as homeowners seek luxurious softness and improved performance. 
Our commercial margins improved with the success of our fashionable new product introductions and streamlined manufacturing processes. During the period, our retail hospitality and health care channels were the strongest, in line with industry trends. Our commercial carpet tile continues to grow as we expand our specifications with large end-users as well as increasing our transactional business. We are completing the consolidation of our woven manufacturing into one location, which will improve our efficiencies and deliver better service and quality.
During the quarter, our hard surface sales increased across all channels as we leverage our carpet relationships. Our high-style laminate collections are outpacing the markets as consumers gravitate to realistic visuals, the enhanced texture and unique water-resistant technology. Our engineered wood sales grew substantially in both new home construction and remodeling. Our longer and wider wood planks have been well received by consumers as a higher-value alternative with contemporary styling. We've announced a wood price increase of 6% to 10% effective on May 15. 
We're increasing sales of our sheet vinyl under our Mohawk brand. Our LVT sales are growing dramatically in both residential commercial sectors as we ramp up production at our new U.S. plant. The plant is making significant progress, and its operations should be optimized by the end of the year. LVT remains the fastest-growing flooring product globally and we are extending our U.S. leadership in the category with a further expansion of our Georgia facility. The additional capacity will be operational at the end of 2017. Our manufacturing plants and all products are improving process efficiencies and quality as we are implementing our equipment upgrades to extend our competitive advantages. To support our business growth, this year, we're expanding our capacity in premade laminate, carpet cushion and polyester carpet and rugs. We're adding another shift to our engineered wood plant and investing in new capacity for longer planks.
For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales were up 56% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment increased 52% [ph] with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 70% on a constant currency basis to an operating margin of approximately 17%. The European flooring market is slightly improving with the LVT wood categories experiencing the greatest growth. Our laminate and wood business in the region outpaced the market trends due to our emphasis on higher-end product categories that are differentiated. 
Our laminate sales are outperforming as our deeply textured water-resistant collection continues its strong momentum in the market. To meet growing demand for longer products, we're installing additional laminate capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. We've completed the integration of the IVC business, which is reducing our costs and improving efficiencies. To offset currency changes in a number of European countries, we're implementing laminate prices -- price increases. 
In Russia, we are focusing on the premium laminate market, and our plant is operating near capacity. Our engineered wood sales rose significantly during the period, benefited by expanded sales under our Quick-Step brand and our direct distribution. Our Czech wood plant is operating near capacity with additional product for the European market being supplied from our Malaysian facility. We anticipate further investments in our wood plant this year to reduce costs and streamline operations. Our material cost during the period were higher as we increased manufacturing to meet demand, and we will implement price increases to compensate for the effect of raw material inflation.
Our sheet vinyl plants are fully utilized in the period, and our margins improved as we increased our residential mix and commercial sales. During April, we experienced a fire at one of our Belgian sheet vinyl plants that reduced sales in the second quarter by about EUR 3.5 million and income by about EUR 500,000 after the insurance recovery. Our LVT sales are growing substantially as our new Belgian production expands, and we source products to grow even faster. 
Additional equipment will be installed in the facility in July to substantially increase our production of LVT. Due to the continued strength of LVT around the globe, we anticipate sales will exceed capacity of the 2 European LVT plants. To meet the higher demand, we have announced plans to further expand our LVT manufacturing Belgium by the end of 2017 also. 
Our insulation panel business grew significantly during the period, primarily through the acquisition of Xtratherm, which was completed at the end of last year. We now operate 5 regional installation panel facilities in Belgium, France, the U.K. and Ireland, extending our geographic reach. As we integrate the Xtratherm acquisition, we have realigned our insulation organization and are improving efficiencies through the implementation of best practices. Our boards and roof panel business is delivering improved sales and margins as we upgrade the mix and equipment. I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Our gross margin, as reported, was 29.5% or 29.7% excluding nonrecurring charges. That's up 200 basis points compared to 2015 results. 
Volume, productivity and input costs drove higher margins. SG&A was $393 million or 18.1% of net sales excluding charges, which is flat with 2015% of net sales. Sales and marketing investments made in the quarter were offset by leverage from higher sales of this year. Our investments are benefiting both sales volume and mix for our business. Unusual charges were $7 million in the quarter and were related primarily to acquisition integration and cost reduction to restructuring activities. We estimate $25 million to $30 million for the full year for these charges. Our operating margin excluding charges was 11.6%. The margin grew in all 3 segments, and our total margin grew by 200 basis points in the quarter, with volume, productivity and input costs driving improvement. FX impacted our earnings negatively by $3 million. 
Interest expense at $12 million for the quarter improved to due to lower rates after the $254 million 2016 bonds were rolled into our commercial paper program. We estimate our full year interest to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million. Other expense was $4 million and increased over last year due to FX transactional adjustments. Our income tax rate was 25.4% which is 50 basis points higher than last year. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% and -- for the full year and slightly over 25% for the second quarter.

On a local basis, all regions saw strong year-over-year growth. Our growth was driven primarily by volume in the Kai acquisition. FX in this segment was a $17 million headwind. Operating income margin excluding charges was 13%, up 110 basis points, driven by volume and productivity, which offset SG&A increases and start-up costs. Investments made in SG&A and start-up costs will expand future sales and margins for us. 
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $906 million, an increase of 7% as reported. Our legacy sales on a constant days basis group 4%. Our ricin sales was primarily from hard surface volume growth in the IVC acquisition. 
Operating income margin excluding charges was 8.7%. That's an increase of 210 basis points from lower input costs, productivity improvements and our acquisition. In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $492 million, an increase of 56% as reported with a legacy sales using constant days and FX, up 4%. Foreign exchange was a $9 million headwind this quarter. The increase resulted primarily from our IVC acquisition.

In the early second quarter, we had a fire in our sheet vinyl plan. The plant is currently running and fully repaired, and we expect our insurance to cover all property and business interruption loss with the exception of the EUR 500,000 deductible. And then finally, in our corporate elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $9 million, and we expect a full year loss of approximately $35 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our receivables were $1,407,000,000 with our says sales outstanding flat at around 52 days, both this year and last year. Our inventories were $1,652,000,000 with our inventory days continuing to show strong improvement at 109 days this year compared to 113 days last year. Fixed assets into the quarter at $3,224,000,000, and this includes, in the first quarter, capital expenditures of $141 million and depreciation and amortization of $100 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be between $600 million and $650 million, and our depreciation and amortization is estimated at $400 million for the full year. Our long-term debt ended the quarter at $3.3 billion and our leverage at 2.1x debt to pro forma EBITDA.

Mohawk delivered another strong quarter during the first period with all of our segments enhancing our position in the marketplace. In the U.S. increased investments in marketing, products and distribution should increase our sales and margins across all product categories. Though growth in Europe is limited, and Russia remains in recession, we anticipate improving our market share and position ourselves for the future. We're investing in our businesses at the highest rate in history to expand our product offering, improve efficiency and increase capacity. Our recent acquisitions have been significantly integrated and our financial leverage has been reduced so we can pursue additional opportunities as they become available. Taking all of these factors into account, our guidance for the second quarter is $3.29 to $3.38, which would represent a 22% to 26% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges. Our first quarter performance reflects the positive impact of the investments we have made in the business over the past 3 years. The incremental capacity increases plan for this year next will support additional sales of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion across our businesses. Our unique products marketing and manufacturing position will enhance our operating results going forward.

During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges. An increase of 40% over the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's history. This is the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company has delivered record adjusted EPS. For the period, our adjusted operating margin rose to a first quarter record of 11.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year as a result of acquisitions, volume, productivity and input costs. Revenues grew across all segments with first quarter net sales increasing 15.5% as reported to $2.2 billion, the highest sales figure we have ever reported for any quarter. All of these results were achieved with one less day in the period than last year. 
We entered 2016 with an optimistic outlook, and our first quarter results exceeded our projections with strong results from all 3 of our segments, in both revenues and margins. Our recent acquisitions continue to improve our performance with the synergies enhancing our existing and acquired businesses and lower impact of the U.S. dollar benefited our results. After completing 4 acquisitions during 2015, we have the capacity to absorb additional opportunities if they become available.
Our major capital projects initiated last year are progressing as expected with the first production line in our Tennessee ceramic plant now operational. Our U.S. LVT production accelerating, the second phase of our European ceramic upgrade now complete. Each of our capital expansion projects create significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take 1 to 3 years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.
In 2016, we have identified more opportunities to grow our business and have already approved additional LVT production lines in the U.S. and Europe, the doubling of our Mexican ceramic plant in Central Mexico, the final phase of our European ceramic upgrades and the expansion of our U.S. and European premium laminate production with new technology. We anticipate investing more than $600 million in capital projects this year, and we are assessing further internal opportunity.
Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single-home family market. With home prices rising and existing home sales strong, the Harvard LIRA index is forecasting residential remodeling to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. 
In April, Home Improvement survey indicated that half of U.S. homeowners are planning remodeling investments this year, and new flooring was the second most common project being anticipated. The consensus among commercial construction forecast is for continued growth during 2016 with hospitality and office space sectors leading the category.
In Mexico, government spending has benefited the country's construction sector, which continues to drive high ceramic growth. In Europe, the Central Bank's latest round of interest rate reductions and it's asset purchase program are supporting the region's economy. The Russian economy remains in a recession with continued pressures from low oil prices.  In 2016, we're investing in all of these markets to position Mohawk for future growth.
Turning to a review of our first quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment sales were up approximately 8% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment grew 11% with the legacy business up almost 9%. Adjusted for operating income for the segment, it rose 18% on a constant currency basis over last year to an operating margin of 13%. Our North American ceramic business, which constitutes the majority of the segment, reflects a strong U.S. market, where U.S. ceramic continues to gain shares. Our business, through our service centers, grew the fastest of all our channels during the period as we invested more in sales personnel, marketing and new product introductions. Within that channel, the combined American Olean and Marazzi  service centers have the highest rate of growth as our consolidated approach expands our customer base. 
We're continuing to upgrade our showrooms, lab warehouses and aggressively promoting business through user-friendly websites and social media. Throughout our network of almost 300 service centers, we're rolling out paperless sales and operation processes to improve customer service and enhance efficiencies. We continue to expand our independent distributor base, which will improve our penetration in the market. Our new floor wall tile products are gaining additional placements in the home center channel as those retailers place greater emphasis on the category. Our new product innovations in wood and stone looks as well as smaller shapes are growing our business and winning industry awards. 
To support our growth, our new plant in Tennessee initiated production on schedule, and the first line is running well. The plant's remaining 2 lines will be operational between now and August. To satisfy increased demand in the U.S., we are utilizing our worldwide ceramic assets in Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria and Russia to support our domestic production. Our Mexican ceramic business is outpacing the market and is the fastest-growing part of the segment. Our mix and margin is continuing to improve as we expand our distribution. The plant we acquired in Western Mexico last year is operating well and continuing to improve its productivity and cost position. We're finalizing the expansion plans to double the ceramic plant near Mexico City with construction beginning in the second quarter. We're continuing to increase our customer base in the market, adding new distributors and expanding home center placements, and increasing our participation in new construction projects. All of our plants in Mexico are improving their productivity and quality as we introduce larger sizes as well as specialized shapes.
Our European ceramic business continues to improve in line with our plan with sales growing in the first period. We are increasing our investments in sales personnel, merchandising, retail training and brand advertising to enhance our distribution. The second phase of our equipment upgrades have been installed and is operational, improving our cost and service levels. Additional investments have been improved to modernize the balance of the original assets that we acquired in 2013. We continue to introduce innovative products that will expand our margins, including stone looks, thin and three-dimensional wall tiles and cement designs.
Our Kai acquisition continues to progress as we enhance the product offering, organization and reporting systems while expanding sales to Western Europe and the U.S. Our Russian ceramic business continues to outperform the market, which remains challenging as the economy contracts and investments in real estate decline. 
Our sales during the first quarter increased on a local basis, while our margins narrowed due to inflation and lower mix. We're introducing many new products and strategically opening own and franchised stores. We're implementing equipment upgrades to optimize our manufacturing of new sizes, and this fall, our new production line will expand our premium offerings. We continue to approach the market aggressively, which will enhance our position when the Russian economy rebounds.
During the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7% as reported. On a constant days basis, the segment grew approximately 9% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 42% over last year to an operating margin of approximately 9%. Our first quarter adjusted profit margin for the segment improved as a result of process efficiencies, investment in new technology, differentiated new products and cost improvements. Last year, we began expanding our investments in sales personnel and marketing to broaden our distribution in carpet and hard surface products. To optimize their performance, our sales organizations are specialized by both product and channel, and we are supporting them with greater sampling, merchandising and retail training.
Our hard surface products continue deliver substantial growth as we expand our market share as consumer flooring preferences shift. Growth in value-priced polyester carpet and lower-commodity pricing are reducing our average selling prices as lower raw material costs are reflected in the market. Despite these pricing pressures, the investments we made last year to differentiate our products and reduce our manufacturing costs are improving our margins. As a reflection of our investment in product innovation, Mohawk's new SmartStrand collections won all 3 major dealer awards at the national trade shows. We continue to build on our strengths in premium residential carpet with innovative products such as Continuum polyester with odor-eliminating technology and Silk naturals, which replicates wool with the superior softness, texture and durability. These introductions are being well received by retailers and should enhance our mix as homeowners seek luxurious softness and improved performance.
Our commercial margins improved with the success of our fashionable new product introductions and streamlined manufacturing processes. During the period, our retail hospitality and health care channels were the strongest, in line with industry trends. Our commercial carpet tile continues to grow as we expand our specifications with large end users as well as increasing our transactional business. We are completing the consolidation of our woven manufacturing into one location, which will improve our efficiencies and deliver better service and quality.
During the quarter, our hard surface sales increased across all channels as we leverage our carpet relationships. Our high-style laminate collections are outpacing the markets as consumers gravitate to realistic visuals, the enhanced texture and unique water-resistant technology. Our engineered wood sales grew substantially in both new home construction and remodeling. Our longer and wider wood planks have been well received by consumers as a higher-value alternative with contemporary styling. We've announced a wood price increase of 6% to 10% effective on May 15.
We're increasing sales of our sheet vinyl under our Mohawk brand. Our LVT sales are growing dramatically in both residential and commercial sectors as we ramp up production at our new U.S. plant. The plant is making significant progress, and its operations should be optimized by the end of the year. LVT remains the fastest-growing flooring product globally, and we are extending our U.S. leadership in the category with a further expansion of our Georgia facility. The additional capacity will be operational at the end of 2017. Our manufacturing plants and all products are improving process efficiencies and quality as we are implementing our equipment upgrades to extend our competitive advantages. To support our business growth, this year, we're expanding our capacity in premium laminate, carpet cushion and polyester carpet and rugs. We're adding another shift to our engineered wood plant and investing in new capacity for longer planks.
For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales were up 56% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment increased 62% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 70% on a constant currency basis to an operating margin of approximately 17%. The European flooring market is slightly improving with the LVT and wood categories experiencing the greatest growth. Our laminate and wood business in the region outpaced the market trends due to our emphasis on higher-end product categories that are differentiated.
Our laminate sales are outperforming as our deeply textured water-resistant collection continues its strong momentum in the market. To meet growing demand for longer products, we're installing additional laminate capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. We've completed the integration of the IVC business, which is reducing our costs and improving efficiencies. To offset currency changes in a number of European countries, we're implementing laminate prices -- price increases.
In Russia, we are focusing on the premium laminate market, and our plant is operating near capacity. Our engineered wood sales rose significantly during the period, benefited by expanded sales under our Quick-Step brand and our direct distribution. Our Czech wood plant is operating near capacity with additional product for the European market being supplied from our Malaysian facility. We anticipate further investments in our wood plant this year to reduce costs and streamline operations. Our material costs during the period were higher as we increased manufacturing to meet demand, and we will implement price increases to compensate for the effect of raw material inflation.
Our sheet vinyl plants are fully utilized in the period, and our margins improved as we increased our residential mix and commercial sales. During April, we experienced a fire at one of our Belgian sheet vinyl plants that reduced sales in the second quarter by about EUR 3.5 million and income by about EUR 500,000 after the insurance recovery. Our LVT sales are growing substantially as our new Belgian production expands, and we source products to grow even faster.
Additional equipment will be installed in the facility in July to substantially increase our production of LVT. Due to the continued strength of LVT around the globe, we anticipate sales will exceed capacity of the 2 European LVT plants. To meet the higher demand, we have announced plans to further expand our LVT manufacturing in Belgium by the end of 2017 also. 
Our insulation panel business grew significantly during the period, primarily through the acquisition of Xtratherm, which was completed at the end of last year. We now operate 5 regional insulation panel facilities in Belgium, France, the U.K. and Ireland, extending our geographic reach. As we integrate the Xtratherm acquisition, we have realigned our insulation organization and are improving efficiencies through the implementation of best practices. Our boards and roof panel business is delivering improved sales and margins as we upgrade the mix and equipment. I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,172,000,000, up 16% from last year or 6% on a legacy basis using constant days exchange rates. FX was a $26 million headwind in the quarter. We had 1 less day in the first quarter, and we will have 1 less day in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We will have 1 more day in the second quarter and the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. All segments and regions grew, with ceramics showing the strongest in performance. Our gross margin, as reported, was 29.5% or 29.7%, excluding nonrecurring charges. That's up 200 basis points compared to 2015 results.
Volume, productivity and input costs drove higher margins. SG&A was $393 million or 18.1% of net sales excluding charges, which is flat with 2015 percent to net sales. Sales and marketing investments, made in the quarter were offset by leverage from higher sales this year. Our investments are benefiting both sales volume and mix for our business. Unusual charges were $7 million in the quarter and were related primarily to acquisition integration and cost reduction to restructuring activities. We estimate $25 million to $30 million for the full year for these charges. Our operating margin excluding charges was 11.6%. The margin grew in all 3 segments, and our total margin grew by 200 basis points in the quarter, with volume, productivity and input costs driving improvement. FX impacted our earnings negatively by $3 million.
Interest expense at $12 million for the quarter improved due to lower rates after the $254 million 2016 bonds were rolled into our commercial paper program. We estimate our full year interest to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million. Other expense was $4 million and increased over last year due to FX transactional adjustments. Our income tax rate was at 25.4% which is 50 basis points higher than last year. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% and slight -- for the full year and slightly over 25% for the second quarter.
Our earnings per share excluding charges were $2.38, an increase of 40%. 
If we move to the segments. The Global Ceramic segment sales as reported were $774 million, which is up 8% over last year, and our legacy sales were up 9% on a constant days and FX basis. On a local basis, all regions saw strong year-over-year growth. Our growth was driven primarily by volume in the Kai acquisition. FX in this segment was a $17 million headwind. Operating income margin excluding charges was 13%, up 110 basis points, driven by volume and productivity, which offset SG&A increases and start-up cost. Investments made in SG&A and start-up costs will expand future sales and margins for us.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $906 million, an increase of 7% as reported. Our legacy sales on a constant days basis grew 4%. Our rise in sales was primarily from hard surface volume growth in the IVC acquisition.
Operating income margin excluding charges was 8.7%. That's an increase of 210 basis points from lower input costs, productivity improvements and our acquisition. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $492 million, an increase of 56% as reported with legacy sales using constant days and FX, up 4%.  Foreign exchange was a $9 million headwind this quarter. The increase resulted primarily from our IVC acquisition. Our operating income margin excluding charges in this segment was 16.7%, an increase of 90 basis points from the acquisition, higher volume, productivity and lower input cost. 
In the early second quarter, we had a fire in our sheet vinyl plant. The plant is currently running and fully repaired, and we expect our insurance to cover all property and business interruption loss with the exception of the EUR 500,000 deductible. 
And then finally, in our Corporate and Elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $9 million, and we expect a full year loss of approximately $35 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our receivables were $1,407,000,000 with our days sales outstanding flat at around 52 days, both this year and last year. Our inventories were $1,652,000,000 with our inventory days continuing to show strong improvement at 190 days -- 109 days this year compared to 113 days last year. 
Fixed assets ended the quarter at $3,224,000,000, and this includes, in the first quarter, capital expenditures of $141 million and depreciation and amortization of $100 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be between $600 million and $650 million, and our depreciation and amortization is estimated at $400 million for the full year. Our long-term debt ended the quarter at $3.3 billion and our leverage at 2.1x debt to pro forma EBITDA.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Mohawk delivered another strong quarter during the first period, with all of our segments enhancing their position in the marketplace. In the U.S. increased investments in marketing, products and distribution should increase our sales and margins across all product categories. Though growth in Europe is limited, and Russia remains in recession, we're anticipating improving our market share and position ourselves for the future. 
We're investing in our businesses at the highest rate in history to expand our product offerings, improve efficiency and increase capacity. Our recent acquisitions have been significantly integrated and our financial leverage has been reduced so we can pursue additional opportunities as they become available. Taking all of these factors into account, our guidance for the second quarter is $3.29 to $3.38, which would represent a 22% to 26% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges. 
Our first quarter performance reflects the positive impact of the investments we have made in the business over the past 3 years. The incremental capacity increases plan for this year next will support additional sales of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion across our businesses. Our unique products marketing and manufacturing position will enhance our operating results going forward.

On the other extreme, probably the difference between putting in new capacity and new product categories in something you own, what happens is it takes a longer time to build up the sales on the front end so you have the costs and the learning curve on the front end without enough volume so those tend to be a little longer so you get -- but what the difference is the returns in the first year or 2 are lower, but when you get out the year 5 and 6, they're much higher than the acquisitions as you go through, and then the acquisitions are all over the place.

For instance, we're one of the largest countertop distributors in the country today, and we got into it because we started out with ceramic flooring, then we went to stone flooring, then the next adjacency allover was stone countertops, hence we moved into it. So the countertop business is an adjacency we've already moved into. We get the largest benefit out of buying things that are in the categories we're in that we can leverage our knowledge and marketing and distribution across the new business, and we get the least synergies out of going into something that's brand-new. As we get further from where we are, and we've done it by -- when we moved from carpet to ceramic or ceramic to laminate or laminate to vinyl, what you see is that when you see us move into the categories, we normally start by buying the best competitor in the marketplace, and the reason is we're buying the knowledge of the category as well as the business, and we start with the best, and then what we try to do is feed it additional capital and try to see if there's other synergies between how we operate businesses, the information systems, the methodologies, and those things create more benefit. And then as long as we're staying and things that go through the same customers and channels, we can actually pull their products into our channels and vice versa as we go through.

Could be more or less. So we have to have -- and it takes about 1.5 years from the time you start the project, to get the capacity up. So what you see is our investments are supporting the things 1.5 years out or more. If we don't invest now, we won't have it then."

During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 40% over the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's histo",2285,"Thank you, Frank. During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 40% over the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's history. This is the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company has delivered record adjusted EPS. For the period, our adjusted operating margin rose to a first quarter record of 11.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year as a result of acquisitions, volume, productivity and input costs. Revenues grew across all segments with first quarter net sales increasing 15.5% as reported to $2.2 billion, the highest sales figure we have ever reported for any quarter. All of these results were achieved with one less day in the period than last year. 
We entered 2016 with an optimistic outlook, and our first quarter results exceeded our projections with strong results from all 3 of our segments, in both revenues and margins. Our recent acquisitions continue to improve our performance with the synergies enhancing our existing and acquired businesses and lower impact of the U.S. dollar benefited our results. After completing 4 acquisitions during 2015, we have the capacity to absorb additional opportunities if they become available.
Our major capital projects initiated last year are progressing as expected with the first production line in our Tennessee ceramic plant now operational. Our U.S. LVT production accelerating, the second phase of our European ceramic upgrade now complete. Each of our capital expansion projects create significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take 1 to 3 years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.
In 2016, we have identified more opportunities to grow our business and have already approved additional LVT production lines in the U.S. and Europe, the doubling of our Mexican ceramic plant in Central Mexico, the final phase of our European ceramic upgrades and the expansion of our U.S. and European premium laminate production with new technology. We anticipate investing more than $600 million in capital projects this year, and we are assessing further internal opportunities.
Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single-home family market. With home prices rising and existing home sales strong, the Harvard LIRA index is forecasting residential remodeling to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. An April Home Improvement survey indicated that half of U.S. homeowners are planning remodeling investments this year, and new flooring was the second most common project being anticipated. The consensus among commercial construction forecast is for continued growth during 2016 with hospitality and office space sectors leading the category.
In Mexico, government spending has benefited the country's construction sector, which continues to drive high ceramic growth. In Europe, the Central Bank's latest round of interest rate reductions and it's asset purchase program are supporting the region's economy. The Russian economy remains in a recession with continued pressures from low oil prices.  In 2016, we're investing in all of these markets to position Mohawk for future growth.
Turning to a review of our first quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment sales were up approximately 8% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment grew 11% with the legacy business up almost 9%. Adjusted for operating income for the segment, it rose 18% on a constant currency basis over last year to an operating margin of 13%. Our North American ceramic business, which constitutes the majority of the segment, reflects a strong U.S. market, where U.S. ceramic continues to gain shares. Our business, through our service centers, grew the fastest of all our channels during the period as we invested more in sales personnel, marketing and new product introductions. Within that channel, the combined American Olean and Marazzi  service centers have the highest rate of growth as our consolidated approach expands our customer base. 
We're continuing to upgrade our showrooms, lab warehouses and aggressively promoting business through user-friendly websites and social media. Throughout our network of almost 300 service centers, we're rolling out paperless sales and operation processes to improve customer service and enhance efficiencies. We continue to expand our independent distributor base, which will improve our penetration in the market. Our new floor and wall tile products are gaining additional placements in the home center channel as those retailers place greater emphasis on the category. Our new product innovations in wood and stone looks as well as smaller shapes are growing our business and winning industry awards. 
To support our growth, our new plant in Tennessee initiated production on schedule, and the first line is running well. The plant's remaining 2 lines will be operational between now and August. To satisfy increased demand in the U.S., we are utilizing our worldwide ceramic assets in Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria and Russia to support our domestic production. Our Mexican ceramic business is outpacing the market and is the fastest-growing part of the segment. Our mix and margin is continuing to improve as we expand our distribution. The plant we acquired in Western Mexico last year is operating well and continuing to improve its productivity and cost position. We're finalizing the expansion plans to double the ceramic plant near Mexico City with construction beginning in the second quarter. We're continuing to increase our customer base in the market, adding new distributors and expanding home center placements, and increasing our participation in new construction projects. All of our plants in Mexico are improving their productivity and quality as we introduce larger sizes as well as specialized shapes.
Our European ceramic business continues to improve in line with our plan with sales growing in the first period. We are increasing our investments in sales personnel, merchandising, retail training and brand advertising to enhance our distribution. The second phase of our equipment upgrades have been installed and is operational, improving our cost and service levels. Additional investments have been improved to modernize the balance of the original assets that we acquired in 2013. We continue to introduce innovative products that will expand our margins, including stone looks, thin and three-dimensional wall tiles and cement designs.
Our Kai acquisition continues to progress as we enhance the product offering, organization and reporting systems while expanding sales to Western Europe and the U.S. Our Russian ceramic business continues to outperform the market, which remains challenging as the economy contracts and investments in real estate decline. 
Our sales during the first quarter increased on a local basis, while our margins narrowed due to inflation and lower mix. We are introducing many new products and strategically opening own and franchised stores. We're implementing equipment upgrades to optimize our manufacturing of new sizes, and this fall, our new production line will expand our premium offerings. We continue to approach the market aggressively, which will enhance our position when the Russian economy rebounds.
During the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7% as reported. On a constant days basis, the segment grew approximately 9% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 42% over last year to an operating margin of approximately 9%. Our first quarter adjusted profit margin for the segment improved as a result of process efficiencies, investment in new technology, differentiated new products and cost improvements. Last year, we began expanding our investments in sales personnel and marketing to broaden our distribution in carpet and hard surface products. To optimize their performance, our sales organizations are specialized by both product and channel, and we are supporting them with greater sampling, merchandising and retail training.
Our hard surface products continue deliver substantial growth as we expand our market share as consumer flooring preferences shift. Growth in value-priced polyester carpet and lower-commodity pricing are reducing our average selling prices as lower raw material costs are reflected in the market. Despite these pricing pressures, the investments we made last year to differentiate our products and reduce our manufacturing costs are improving our margins. As a reflection of our investment in product innovation, Mohawk's new SmartStrand collections won all 3 major dealer awards at the national trade shows. We continue to build on our strengths in premium residential carpet with innovative products such as Continuum polyester with odor-eliminating technology and Silk naturals, which replicates wool with a superior softness, texture and durability. These introductions are being well received by retailers and should enhance our mix as homeowners seek luxurious softness and improved performance.
Our commercial margins improved with the success of our fashionable new product introductions and streamlined manufacturing processes. During the period, our retail, hospitality and health care channels were the strongest, in line with industry trends. Our commercial carpet tile continues to grow as we expand our specifications with large end users as well as increasing our transactional business. We are completing the consolidation of our woven manufacturing into one location, which will improve our efficiencies and deliver better service and quality.
During the quarter, our hard surface sales increased across all channels as we leverage our carpet relationships. Our high-style laminate collections are outpacing the markets as consumers gravitate to realistic visuals, the enhanced texture and unique water-resistant technology. Our engineered wood sales grew substantially in both new home construction and remodeling. Our longer and wider wood planks have been well received by consumers as a higher-value alternative with contemporary styling. We've announced a wood price increase of 6% to 10% effective on May 15.
We're increasing sales of our sheet vinyl under our Mohawk brand. Our LVT sales are growing dramatically in both residential and commercial sectors as we ramp up production at our new U.S. plant. The plant is making significant progress, and its operations should be optimized by the end of the year. LVT remains the fastest-growing flooring product globally, and we are extending our U.S. leadership in the category with a further expansion of our Georgia facility. The additional capacity will be operational at the end of 2017. Our manufacturing plants and all products are improving process efficiencies and quality as we are implementing our equipment upgrades to extend our competitive advantages. To support our business growth, this year, we're expanding our capacity in premium laminate, carpet cushion and polyester carpet and rugs. We're adding another shift to our engineered wood plant and investing in new capacity for longer planks.
For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales were up 56% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment increased 62% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 70% on a constant currency basis to an operating margin of approximately 17%. The European flooring market is slightly improving with the LVT and wood categories experiencing the greatest growth. Our laminate and wood business in the region outpaced the market trends due to our emphasis on higher-end product categories that are differentiated.
Our laminate sales are outperforming as our deeply textured water-resistant collection continues its strong momentum in the market. To meet growing demand for longer products, we're installing additional laminate capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. We've completed the integration of the IVC business, which is reducing our costs and improving efficiencies. To offset currency changes in a number of European countries, we're implementing laminate prices -- price increases.
In Russia, we are focusing on the premium laminate market, and our plant is operating near capacity. Our engineered wood sales rose significantly during the period, benefited by expanded sales under our Quick-Step brand and our direct distribution. Our Czech wood plant is operating near capacity with additional product for the European market being supplied from our Malaysian facility. We anticipate further investments in our wood plant this year to reduce costs and streamline operations. Our material costs during the period were higher as we increased manufacturing to meet demand, and we will implement price increases to compensate for the effect of raw material inflation.
Our sheet vinyl plants are fully utilized in the period, and our margins improved as we increased our residential mix and commercial sales. During April, we experienced a fire at one of our Belgian sheet vinyl plants that reduced sales in the second quarter by about EUR 3.5 million and income by about EUR 500,000 after the insurance recovery. Our LVT sales are growing substantially as our new Belgian production expands, and we source products to grow even faster.
Additional equipment will be installed in the facility in July to substantially increase our production of LVT. Due to the continued strength of LVT around the globe, we anticipate sales will exceed capacity of the 2 European LVT plants. To meet the higher demand, we have announced plans to further expand our LVT manufacturing in Belgium by the end of 2017 also. 
Our insulation panel business grew significantly during the period, primarily through the acquisition of Xtratherm, which was completed at the end of last year. We now operate 5 regional insulation panel facilities in Belgium, France, the U.K. and Ireland, extending our geographic reach. As we integrate the Xtratherm acquisition, we have realigned our insulation organization and are improving efficiencies through the implementation of best practices. Our boards and roof panel business is delivering improved sales and margins as we upgrade the mix and equipment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,172,000,000, up 16% from last year or 6% on a legacy basis using constant days exchange rates. FX was a $26 million headwind in the quarter. We had 1 less day in the first quarter, and we will have 1 less day in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We will have 1 more day in the second quarter and the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. All segments and regions grew, with ceramics showing the strongest in performance. Our gross margin, as reported, was 29.5% or 29.7%, excluding nonrecurring charges. That's up 200 basis points compared to 2015 results.
Volume, productivity and input costs drove higher margins. SG&A was $393 million or 18.1% of net sales excluding charges, which is flat with 2015 percent to net sales. Sales and marketing investments, made in the quarter were offset by leverage from higher sales this year. Our investments are benefiting both sales volume and mix for our business. Unusual charges were $7 million in the quarter and were related primarily to acquisition integration and cost reduction through restructuring activities. We estimate $25 million to $30 million for the full year for these charges. Our operating margin excluding charges was 11.6%. The margin grew in all 3 segments, and our total margin grew by 200 basis points in the quarter, with volume, productivity and input costs driving improvement. FX impacted our earnings negatively by $3 million.
Interest expense at $12 million for the quarter improved due to lower rates after the $254 million 2016 bonds were rolled into our commercial paper program. We estimate our full year interest to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million. Other expense was $4 million and increased over last year due to FX transactional adjustments. Our income tax rate was at 25.4% which is 50 basis points higher than last year. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% and slight -- for the full year and slightly over 25% for the second quarter. Our earnings per share excluding charges were $2.38, an increase of 40%. 
If we move to the segments. The Global Ceramic segment sales as reported were $774 million, which is up 8% over last year, and our legacy sales were up 9% on a constant days and FX basis. On a local basis, all regions saw strong year-over-year growth. Our growth was driven primarily by volume in the Kai acquisition. FX in this segment was a $17 million headwind. Operating income margin excluding charges was 13%, up 110 basis points, driven by volume and productivity, which offset SG&A increases and start-up cost. Investments made in SG&A and start-up costs will expand future sales and margins for us.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $906 million, an increase of 7% as reported. Our legacy sales on a constant days basis grew 4%. Our rise in sales was primarily from hard surface volume growth in the IVC acquisition. Operating income margin excluding charges was 8.7%. That's an increase of 210 basis points from lower input costs, productivity improvements and our acquisition. In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $492 million, an increase of 56% as reported with legacy sales using constant days and FX, up 4%.  Foreign exchange was a $9 million headwind this quarter. The increase resulted primarily from our IVC acquisition. Our operating income margin excluding charges in this segment was 16.7%, an increase of 90 basis points from the acquisition, higher volume, productivity and lower input cost. 
In the early second quarter, we had a fire in our sheet vinyl plant. The plant is currently running and fully repaired, and we expect our insurance to cover all property and business interruption loss with the exception of the EUR 500,000 deductible. And then finally, in our Corporate and Elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $9 million, and we expect a full year loss of approximately $35 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our receivables were $1,407,000,000 with our days sales outstanding flat at around 52 days, both this year and last year. Our inventories were $1,652,000,000 with our inventory days continuing to show strong improvement at 190 days -- 109 days this year compared to 113 days last year.  Fixed assets ended the quarter at $3,224,000,000, and this includes, in the first quarter, capital expenditures of $141 million and depreciation and amortization of $100 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be between $600 million and $650 million, and our depreciation and amortization is estimated at $400 million for the full year. Our long-term debt ended the quarter at $3.3 billion and our leverage at 2.1x debt to pro forma EBITDA.

Mohawk delivered another strong quarter during the first period, with all of our segments enhancing their position in the marketplace. In the U.S. increased investments in marketing, products and distribution should increase our sales and margins across all product categories. Though growth in Europe is limited, and Russia remains in recession, we're anticipating improving our market share and position ourselves for the future. 
We're investing in our businesses at the highest rate in history to expand our product offerings, improve efficiency and increase capacity. Our recent acquisitions have been significantly integrated and our financial leverage has been reduced so we can pursue additional opportunities as they become available. Taking all of these factors into account, our guidance for the second quarter is $3.29 to $3.38, which would represent a 22% to 26% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges.  Our first quarter performance reflects the positive impact of the investments we have made in the business over the past 3 years.

I think what we keep explaining is that these investments we've been making aren't to look at, the investments are to increase our productivity. We have very strict strategies about return on investment and hurdles they have to overdue, on one side. On the other side, the margins we're getting is because we're also investing in equipment that allows us to differentiate the products in the marketplace and get higher premiums. We talked already a little bit about the laminate business. We're investing in our older equipment, our ceramic business to make bigger sizes and smaller sizes, which most of our competitors don't have the capability, and so these investments are helping the mix as well as the cost and all the different categories. And again, like I said, if we can find more of them, we'll do them."

On the other extreme, probably the difference between putting in new capacity and new product categories in something you own, what happens is it takes a longer time to build up the sales on the front end so you have the costs and the learning curve on the front end without enough volume so those tend to be a little longer. So you get -- but what the difference is the returns in the first year or 2 are lower, but when you get out the year 5 and 6, they're much higher than the acquisitions as you go through, and then the acquisitions are all over the place.

For instance, we're one of the largest countertop distributors in the country today, and we got into it because we started out with ceramic flooring, then we went to stone flooring, then the next adjacency allover was stone countertops, hence we moved into it. So the countertop business is an adjacency we've already moved into. We get the largest benefit out of buying things that are in the categories we're in that we can leverage our knowledge and marketing and distribution across the new business, and we get the least synergies out of going into something that's brand-new. As we get further from where we are, and we've done it by -- when we moved from carpet to ceramic or ceramic to laminate or laminate to vinyl, what you see is that when you see us move into the categories, we normally start by buying the best competitor in the marketplace. And the reason is we're buying the knowledge of the category as well as the business. And we start with the best, and then what we try to do is feed it additional capital and try to see if there's other synergies between how we operate businesses, the information systems, the methodologies, and those things create more benefit. And then as long as we're staying and things that go through the same customers and channels, we can actually pull their products into our channels and vice versa as we go through. The extent past there is going into totally new geographies, and we've gone into them both ways. We've gone into them greenfield, and we've gone into them by buying, what we perceive to be typically best-of-class in the category, too. On the other hand, we break our own rules. We got Marazzi, we got a ceramic business in Europe that was performing horribly, and we put in a new management group in that and made that work.

I would guess our share is probably somewhere in the 15% share as we start. Our strategy in Russia is we are focused on the mid- to high end part of the marketplace. We have the only brand in Russia. We have own distribution across Russia. We have about 300-something franchise stores across Russia, which we own about 15%, 20%. So we're well positioned in the high end part of the marketplace, and we think we can keep exploiting it. We're basically running all our capacity, and then we're putting in new capacity this year that actually makes more -- a higher level of product that historically would've come out of Italy, and our intention is to become the premium supplier of it. And that's where we are, and we think it's a good opportunity. If the market ever turns around, we'll be in really good shape. And the negative at the time though is our margins are declining as we're driving our business through the market."

During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 40% over the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's histo",2285,"Thank you, Frank. During the quarter, Mohawk delivered an outstanding performance. Our earnings per share were $2.38, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 40% over the prior year and the highest first quarter earnings per share in the company's history. This is the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company has delivered record adjusted EPS. For the period, our adjusted operating margin rose to a first quarter record of 11.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year as a result of acquisitions, volume, productivity and input costs. Revenues grew across all segments with first quarter net sales increasing 15.5% as reported to $2.2 billion, the highest sales figure we have ever reported for any quarter. All of these results were achieved with one less day in the period than last year. 
We entered 2016 with an optimistic outlook, and our first quarter results exceeded our projections with strong results from all 3 of our segments, in both revenues and margins. Our recent acquisitions continue to improve our performance with the synergies enhancing our existing and acquired businesses and lower impact of the U.S. dollar benefited our results. After completing 4 acquisitions during 2015, we have the capacity to absorb additional opportunities if they become available.
Our major capital projects initiated last year are progressing as expected with the first production line in our Tennessee ceramic plant now operational. Our U.S. LVT production accelerating, the second phase of our European ceramic upgrade now complete. Each of our capital expansion projects create significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take 1 to 3 years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.
In 2016, we have identified more opportunities to grow our business and have already approved additional LVT production lines in the U.S. and Europe, the doubling of our Mexican ceramic plant in Central Mexico, the final phase of our European ceramic upgrades and the expansion of our U.S. and European premium laminate production with new technology. We anticipate investing more than $600 million in capital projects this year, and we are assessing further internal opportunities.
Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single-home family market. With home prices rising and existing home sales strong, the Harvard LIRA index is forecasting residential remodeling to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. An April Home Improvement survey indicated that half of U.S. homeowners are planning remodeling investments this year, and new flooring was the second most common project being anticipated. The consensus among commercial construction forecast is for continued growth during 2016 with hospitality and office space sectors leading the category.
In Mexico, government spending has benefited the country's construction sector, which continues to drive high ceramic growth. In Europe, the Central Bank's latest round of interest rate reductions and it's asset purchase program are supporting the region's economy. The Russian economy remains in a recession with continued pressures from low oil prices.  In 2016, we're investing in all of these markets to position Mohawk for future growth.
Turning to a review of our first quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic segment sales were up approximately 8% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment grew 11% with the legacy business up almost 9%. Adjusted for operating income for the segment, it rose 18% on a constant currency basis over last year to an operating margin of 13%. Our North American ceramic business, which constitutes the majority of the segment, reflects a strong U.S. market, where U.S. ceramic continues to gain shares. Our business, through our service centers, grew the fastest of all our channels during the period as we invested more in sales personnel, marketing and new product introductions. Within that channel, the combined American Olean and Marazzi  service centers have the highest rate of growth as our consolidated approach expands our customer base. 
We're continuing to upgrade our showrooms, lab warehouses and aggressively promoting business through user-friendly websites and social media. Throughout our network of almost 300 service centers, we're rolling out paperless sales and operation processes to improve customer service and enhance efficiencies. We continue to expand our independent distributor base, which will improve our penetration in the market. Our new floor and wall tile products are gaining additional placements in the home center channel as those retailers place greater emphasis on the category. Our new product innovations in wood and stone looks as well as smaller shapes are growing our business and winning industry awards. 
To support our growth, our new plant in Tennessee initiated production on schedule, and the first line is running well. The plant's remaining 2 lines will be operational between now and August. To satisfy increased demand in the U.S., we are utilizing our worldwide ceramic assets in Mexico, Italy, Bulgaria and Russia to support our domestic production. Our Mexican ceramic business is outpacing the market and is the fastest-growing part of the segment. Our mix and margin is continuing to improve as we expand our distribution. The plant we acquired in Western Mexico last year is operating well and continuing to improve its productivity and cost position. We're finalizing the expansion plans to double the ceramic plant near Mexico City with construction beginning in the second quarter. We're continuing to increase our customer base in the market, adding new distributors and expanding home center placements, and increasing our participation in new construction projects. All of our plants in Mexico are improving their productivity and quality as we introduce larger sizes as well as specialized shapes.
Our European ceramic business continues to improve in line with our plan with sales growing in the first period. We are increasing our investments in sales personnel, merchandising, retail training and brand advertising to enhance our distribution. The second phase of our equipment upgrades have been installed and is operational, improving our cost and service levels. Additional investments have been improved to modernize the balance of the original assets that we acquired in 2013. We continue to introduce innovative products that will expand our margins, including stone looks, thin and three-dimensional wall tiles and cement designs.
Our Kai acquisition continues to progress as we enhance the product offering, organization and reporting systems while expanding sales to Western Europe and the U.S. Our Russian ceramic business continues to outperform the market, which remains challenging as the economy contracts and investments in real estate decline. 
Our sales during the first quarter increased on a local basis, while our margins narrowed due to inflation and lower mix. We are introducing many new products and strategically opening own and franchised stores. We're implementing equipment upgrades to optimize our manufacturing of new sizes, and this fall, our new production line will expand our premium offerings. We continue to approach the market aggressively, which will enhance our position when the Russian economy rebounds.
During the quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7% as reported. On a constant days basis, the segment grew approximately 9% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 42% over last year to an operating margin of approximately 9%. Our first quarter adjusted profit margin for the segment improved as a result of process efficiencies, investment in new technology, differentiated new products and cost improvements. Last year, we began expanding our investments in sales personnel and marketing to broaden our distribution in carpet and hard surface products. To optimize their performance, our sales organizations are specialized by both product and channel, and we are supporting them with greater sampling, merchandising and retail training.
Our hard surface products continue deliver substantial growth as we expand our market share as consumer flooring preferences shift. Growth in value-priced polyester carpet and lower-commodity pricing are reducing our average selling prices as lower raw material costs are reflected in the market. Despite these pricing pressures, the investments we made last year to differentiate our products and reduce our manufacturing costs are improving our margins. As a reflection of our investment in product innovation, Mohawk's new SmartStrand collections won all 3 major dealer awards at the national trade shows. We continue to build on our strengths in premium residential carpet with innovative products such as Continuum polyester with odor-eliminating technology and Silk naturals, which replicates wool with a superior softness, texture and durability. These introductions are being well received by retailers and should enhance our mix as homeowners seek luxurious softness and improved performance.
Our commercial margins improved with the success of our fashionable new product introductions and streamlined manufacturing processes. During the period, our retail, hospitality and health care channels were the strongest, in line with industry trends. Our commercial carpet tile continues to grow as we expand our specifications with large end users as well as increasing our transactional business. We are completing the consolidation of our woven manufacturing into one location, which will improve our efficiencies and deliver better service and quality.
During the quarter, our hard surface sales increased across all channels as we leverage our carpet relationships. Our high-style laminate collections are outpacing the markets as consumers gravitate to realistic visuals, the enhanced texture and unique water-resistant technology. Our engineered wood sales grew substantially in both new home construction and remodeling. Our longer and wider wood planks have been well received by consumers as a higher-value alternative with contemporary styling. We've announced a wood price increase of 6% to 10% effective on May 15.
We're increasing sales of our sheet vinyl under our Mohawk brand. Our LVT sales are growing dramatically in both residential and commercial sectors as we ramp up production at our new U.S. plant. The plant is making significant progress, and its operations should be optimized by the end of the year. LVT remains the fastest-growing flooring product globally, and we are extending our U.S. leadership in the category with a further expansion of our Georgia facility. The additional capacity will be operational at the end of 2017. Our manufacturing plants and all products are improving process efficiencies and quality as we are implementing our equipment upgrades to extend our competitive advantages. To support our business growth, this year, we're expanding our capacity in premium laminate, carpet cushion and polyester carpet and rugs. We're adding another shift to our engineered wood plant and investing in new capacity for longer planks.
For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales were up 56% as reported. On a constant days and currency basis, the segment increased 62% with legacy sales up 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment rose 70% on a constant currency basis to an operating margin of approximately 17%. The European flooring market is slightly improving with the LVT and wood categories experiencing the greatest growth. Our laminate and wood business in the region outpaced the market trends due to our emphasis on higher-end product categories that are differentiated.
Our laminate sales are outperforming as our deeply textured water-resistant collection continues its strong momentum in the market. To meet growing demand for longer products, we're installing additional laminate capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. We've completed the integration of the IVC business, which is reducing our costs and improving efficiencies. To offset currency changes in a number of European countries, we're implementing laminate prices -- price increases.
In Russia, we are focusing on the premium laminate market, and our plant is operating near capacity. Our engineered wood sales rose significantly during the period, benefited by expanded sales under our Quick-Step brand and our direct distribution. Our Czech wood plant is operating near capacity with additional product for the European market being supplied from our Malaysian facility. We anticipate further investments in our wood plant this year to reduce costs and streamline operations. Our material costs during the period were higher as we increased manufacturing to meet demand, and we will implement price increases to compensate for the effect of raw material inflation.
Our sheet vinyl plants are fully utilized in the period, and our margins improved as we increased our residential mix and commercial sales. During April, we experienced a fire at one of our Belgian sheet vinyl plants that reduced sales in the second quarter by about EUR 3.5 million and income by about EUR 500,000 after the insurance recovery. Our LVT sales are growing substantially as our new Belgian production expands, and we source products to grow even faster.
Additional equipment will be installed in the facility in July to substantially increase our production of LVT. Due to the continued strength of LVT around the globe, we anticipate sales will exceed capacity of the 2 European LVT plants. To meet the higher demand, we have announced plans to further expand our LVT manufacturing in Belgium by the end of 2017 also. 
Our insulation panel business grew significantly during the period, primarily through the acquisition of Xtratherm, which was completed at the end of last year. We now operate 5 regional insulation panel facilities in Belgium, France, the U.K. and Ireland, extending our geographic reach. As we integrate the Xtratherm acquisition, we have realigned our insulation organization and are improving efficiencies through the implementation of best practices. Our boards and roof panel business is delivering improved sales and margins as we upgrade the mix and equipment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,172,000,000, up 16% from last year or 6% on a legacy basis using constant days exchange rates. FX was a $26 million headwind in the quarter. We had 1 less day in the first quarter, and we will have 1 less day in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We will have 1 more day in the second quarter and the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. All segments and regions grew, with ceramics showing the strongest in performance. Our gross margin, as reported, was 29.5% or 29.7%, excluding nonrecurring charges. That's up 200 basis points compared to 2015 results.
Volume, productivity and input costs drove higher margins. SG&A was $393 million or 18.1% of net sales excluding charges, which is flat with 2015 percent to net sales. Sales and marketing investments, made in the quarter were offset by leverage from higher sales this year. Our investments are benefiting both sales volume and mix for our business. Unusual charges were $7 million in the quarter and were related primarily to acquisition integration and cost reduction through restructuring activities. We estimate $25 million to $30 million for the full year for these charges. Our operating margin excluding charges was 11.6%. The margin grew in all 3 segments, and our total margin grew by 200 basis points in the quarter, with volume, productivity and input costs driving improvement. FX impacted our earnings negatively by $3 million.
Interest expense at $12 million for the quarter improved due to lower rates after the $254 million 2016 bonds were rolled into our commercial paper program. We estimate our full year interest to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million. Other expense was $4 million and increased over last year due to FX transactional adjustments. Our income tax rate was at 25.4% which is 50 basis points higher than last year. We estimate our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% and slight -- for the full year and slightly over 25% for the second quarter. Our earnings per share excluding charges were $2.38, an increase of 40%. 
If we move to the segments. The Global Ceramic segment sales as reported were $774 million, which is up 8% over last year, and our legacy sales were up 9% on a constant days and FX basis. On a local basis, all regions saw strong year-over-year growth. Our growth was driven primarily by volume in the Kai acquisition. FX in this segment was a $17 million headwind. Operating income margin excluding charges was 13%, up 110 basis points, driven by volume and productivity, which offset SG&A increases and start-up cost. Investments made in SG&A and start-up costs will expand future sales and margins for us.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $906 million, an increase of 7% as reported. Our legacy sales on a constant days basis grew 4%. Our rise in sales was primarily from hard surface volume growth in the IVC acquisition. Operating income margin excluding charges was 8.7%. That's an increase of 210 basis points from lower input costs, productivity improvements and our acquisition. In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales were $492 million, an increase of 56% as reported with legacy sales using constant days and FX, up 4%.  Foreign exchange was a $9 million headwind this quarter. The increase resulted primarily from our IVC acquisition. Our operating income margin excluding charges in this segment was 16.7%, an increase of 90 basis points from the acquisition, higher volume, productivity and lower input cost. 
In the early second quarter, we had a fire in our sheet vinyl plant. The plant is currently running and fully repaired, and we expect our insurance to cover all property and business interruption loss with the exception of the EUR 500,000 deductible. And then finally, in our Corporate and Elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $9 million, and we expect a full year loss of approximately $35 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our receivables were $1,407,000,000 with our days sales outstanding flat at around 52 days, both this year and last year. Our inventories were $1,652,000,000 with our inventory days continuing to show strong improvement at 190 days -- 109 days this year compared to 113 days last year.  Fixed assets ended the quarter at $3,224,000,000, and this includes, in the first quarter, capital expenditures of $141 million and depreciation and amortization of $100 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be between $600 million and $650 million, and our depreciation and amortization is estimated at $400 million for the full year. Our long-term debt ended the quarter at $3.3 billion and our leverage at 2.1x debt to pro forma EBITDA.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Mohawk delivered another strong quarter during the first period, with all of our segments enhancing their position in the marketplace. In the U.S. increased investments in marketing, products and distribution should increase our sales and margins across all product categories. Though growth in Europe is limited, and Russia remains in recession, we're anticipating improving our market share and position ourselves for the future. 
We're investing in our businesses at the highest rate in history to expand our product offerings, improve efficiency and increase capacity. Our recent acquisitions have been significantly integrated and our financial leverage has been reduced so we can pursue additional opportunities as they become available. Taking all of these factors into account, our guidance for the second quarter is $3.29 to $3.38, which would represent a 22% to 26% increase over 2015, excluding any restructuring charges.  Our first quarter performance reflects the positive impact of the investments we have made in the business over the past 3 years. The incremental capacity increases plan for this year next will support additional sales of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion across our businesses. Our unique products, marketing and manufacturing position will enhance our operating results going forward.
We'll now be glad to take any questions."

On the other extreme, probably the difference between putting in new capacity and new product categories in something you own, what happens is it takes a longer time to build up the sales on the front end so you have the costs and the learning curve on the front end without enough volume so those tend to be a little longer.

For instance, we're one of the largest countertop distributors in the country today, and we got into it because we started out with ceramic flooring, then we went to stone flooring, then the next adjacency allover was stone countertops, hence we moved into it. So the countertop business is an adjacency we've already moved into. We get the largest benefit out of buying things that are in the categories we're in that we can leverage our knowledge and marketing and distribution across the new business, and we get the least synergies out of going into something that's brand-new. As we get further from where we are, and we've done it by -- when we moved from carpet to ceramic or ceramic to laminate or laminate to vinyl, what you see is that when you see us move into the categories, we normally start by buying the best competitor in the marketplace. And the reason is we're buying the knowledge of the category as well as the business. And we start with the best, and then what we try to do is feed it additional capital and try to see if there's other synergies between how we operate businesses, the information systems, the methodologies, and those things create more benefit. And then as long as we're staying and things that go through the same customers and channels, we can actually pull their products into our channels and vice versa as we go through.

A lot of discussion around that, but when you talk about -- again, just so I understand it fully. The $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion that you expect to realize over the next 3 years so I guess I'm thinking 2017 through 2019, is there a way to think about that amount of sales relative to just supporting your ability to grow with the market versus market share gains? In other words, given that you're at capacity in different of your plants, it sounds like part of this is just needed to meet the market growth itself. So any kind of help on that $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion around what's, in other words, supporting the just natural market growth versus what might be thought of as in terms of share gains would be very helpful."

Some of it is coming from imported products that have gotten close to disappearing from the marketplace, which at one point were a large part. I would guess our share is probably somewhere in the 15% share as we start. Our strategy in Russia is we are focused on the mid- to high end part of the marketplace. We have the only brand in Russia. We have own distribution across Russia. We have about 300-something franchise stores across Russia, which we own about 15%, 20%. So we're well positioned in the high end part of the marketplace, and we think we can keep exploiting it. We're basically running all our capacity, and then we're putting in new capacity this year that actually makes more -- a higher level of product that historically would've come out of Italy, and our intention is to become the premium supplier of it.

Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. Th",1911,"Thank you, Frank. Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47, excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. This marks the ninth consecutive period that Mohawk has delivered record adjusted earnings per share. Our strategic business initiatives and our acquisitions all contributed to a rise in earnings. For the quarter, our operating margin grew 270 basis points to a second quarter record of 15.2% as a result of productivity, sales volume, acquisitions and lower input costs, offset partially by investments and SG&A and unfavorable price mix.
Our revenues for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 13%, our highest quarterly revenues ever. During the period, we generated free cash flow of more than $270 million. Our innovations in products and processes, investments and efficiencies and integration of our acquisitions enhanced our performance during the quarter and provide a foundation for long-term growth. Our recent acquisitions were progressing as we broaden our strategies, leverage our distribution and provide additional resources. Across the enterprise, we're investing in marketing to improve our product introductions and expand our distribution in sales. We anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales will improve as we progress through this year. To optimize our businesses, we have initiated many capital projects that will enhance our performance this year and beyond by expanding our capacity, product offering and efficiencies. We're in the final stages of the startup of our new U.S. ceramic LVT and outdoor rug operations, as well as our European LVT plant. We've begun additional projects to support our growth including LVT and laminate in the U.S. and Europe, ceramic in Mexico, Italy and Russia, Continuum Polyester carpet, engineered wood and utility mat in the U.S. This year, we anticipate our capital expenditures will exceed $600 million depending on the timing of payments.
Consumer spending at the end of the second quarter strengthened the U.S. economy. The most recent National Association of Builders reports affirm continuing recovery of the U.S. single-family home market, continued job creation, new household formations and low mortgage rates to support housing growth throughout this year. Harvard's LIRA index projects remodeling activity will approach its 2006 peak in the middle of next year. The latest Architectural Billing Index, which measures commercial design activity, rose to the highest level in almost a year. In Mexico, low inflation has raised consumer confidence to its highest level in the year and the comments are predicting further GDP growth. The European Central Bank continues to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing and low interest rates. The Russian economy remains in a recession, but there are indications it may be nearing a bottom. I'll now review our second quarter performance by segment. 
Our Global Ceramic sales rose 5% as reported, with operating income for the segment growing 16% over last year to a margin of 17%. FX negatively impacted the translation of our sales from Mexico and Russia by $16 million. Our North American ceramic business continued to grow and our margins benefited from higher volume, productivity and mix. The home construction channel outperformed the rest of the business and we're expanding our position with builders across the country. Our new product introductions are gaining momentum and positively impacting our margins. We increased sales personnel and distribution points to optimize our market position. The introduction of some new account programs were postponed by large customers in the period and are back on track. Sales of our countertops are increasing as we expand our distribution and product offering. We continue to enhance of the quality of our independent distributor network and have expanded American OEM Marazzi service centers on the West Coast. Our new Tennessee ceramic plant is ahead of schedule with a final production line becoming operational in the third quarter. We are manufacturing higher-value products at this facility, including 48-inch wood planks and color-bodied porcelain tiles. The plant in Western Mexico that we acquired last year is improving its importance, with higher production levels and lower costs. We're focusing each of our North American plants on specific products to optimize our productivity and increase their efficiency and quality. We are reengineering our product formulations and increasing the recycling of our ceramic waste. Our ceramic operating margins in Mexico expanded as we upgraded our mix and reduced our costs. All of our Mexican tile capacity is being utilized and we have begun the expansion of our Salamanca plant. We will double its capacity by adding new lines that will be operational the fall of next year. We continue to grow our retail sales, as well as our participation in DIY and new construction channels in Mexico. Our European ceramic sales continue to improve with expanded margins and improve mix by upgrading our asset, enhancing our offering and improving our sales execution, we've increased revenue and profitability. To continue these trends, we're introducing more differentiated products in the middle price points and investing in retail merchandising, retail sales training and consumer advertising. We have initiated the final phase of our Italian asset modernization, which will be completed during the first half of next year. In addition, we've purchased a new manufacturing line to make even larger tiles to be used on floors, walls and countertops. We're enhancing our product offering, improving efficiencies and supplying product to our Western European and U.S. markets. Despite the continued decline of the Russian economy and ceramic industry, our sales rose significantly on a local basis with improvement in volume, price and mix. We're increasing our market share to industry-leading design and broader distribution. We've started up a new line to give us more production to satisfy our growing demand. We've enhanced the strength of our organization and broaden our sales and manufacturing capability. We are further expanding our capacity to prepare for a stronger Russian market in 2018.
For the second quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7% with operating income for the segment increasing 25% to a margin of 12% as reported. Operating income grew 16% over last year to a margin of 13%, excluding unusual charges. The segment's profitability improved as we increased investments in sales personnel, retail merchandising and samples. Like ceramic, some large customers postponed product launches and reduced inventory in the period and we anticipate sales improvement in the third quarter.
Our residential carpet margins expanded as a result of our differentiated products, process innovation and investments that lowered our cost structure. During the quarter, the industry's average selling price for residential carpet declined due to the shift to polyester and the lower cost of materials. Our mix was negatively impacted by the strength of the new home and multifamily channels, which utilized lower value products. To satisfy the changing carpet market, we're adding more Continuum polyester production, which uses recycled materials to provide higher quality and value.
We widened the distribution of our SmartStrand carpet, Karastan broadloom and main collections, which outpaced our other residential sales. Our exclusive SmartStrand franchises is being benefited by our Silk naturals collection, which has the appearance of wool but a softer, more luxurious and easier to maintain. We continue to strengthen our manufacturing performance with many process advances, higher yields and material enhancements. Our commercial carpet sales increased as we strengthened our product offering and expanded our sales in all channels. Our innovative commercial introductions received multiple awards at the recent show and gained interest from architects and designers who attended. We continue to simplify our manufacturing, consolidate plans and improve our planning processes. We're enhancing the design and value we provide to our customers while increasing our margins at the same time. All of our commercial channels are showing improvement with hospitality and senior living the strongest. Our new innovations in laminate are differentiating our products and expanding our market share. We continue to deliver unique styling and performance features in our laminate collections. Our European operations are providing product to the U.S. until our new capacity is operational next year. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow and we have the price increase that will be implemented in the third quarter. By the end of this year, we will install more engineered wood production to satisfy greater demand and produce higher-value products. There is pressure on the solid wood sales as consumer preference shifts to engineered.
In June, we have a disruption in our Virginia wood plant which impacted sales by $2 million and we're now getting back to normal levels. Our vinyl business continued to expand as we increased the product assortment and distribution of our LVT and cheap vinyl. Our growth in LVT category has been constrained by our manufacturing capacity. We have recently made equipment modifications that will significantly raise our LVT production and reduce costs. We are preparing to introduce new design, which features to further grow our LVT sales in both the residential and commercial. By the end of the year -- by the end of next year, we will double our U.S. LVT capacity and enhance our capabilities in this fast-growing category.
For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up 51% with operating income rising 91% to a margin of 20% as reported. Operating income grew 67% to a margin of 21% on a local basis excluding charges. Our Flooring business improved significantly, led by premium laminate and LVT. Our laminate mix benefited from our sales of our new collections featuring more realistic visuals and water resistance. We're adding laminate capacity in Europe to support the next generation of this unique technology. To offset currency fluctuations, we're announcing selective price increases. The system integration for both laminate will be completed during the third quarter and allow us to realize additional synergies. In Russia, our laminate facility continues to be fully utilized and we're exploring options to add capacity. The mix of our wood business improved during the period, offset by negative currency. Higher sales of wider wood increased our material costs and we are raising prices to offset. We're reducing our wood SKUs and driving productivity and quality. Our LVT sales and margins increased as our mix and efficiencies improved. To support our LVT growth, additional equipment is being installed there also to raise our capacity and we are sourcing products to supplement in the meantime. To satisfy future LVT growth, another production line should be operational by the end of the year.
Our sheet vinyl sales were negatively affected by a fire in our Belgium plant that we reviewed last quarter. The operations are presently running about 95% and -- of our expected rate. And full production will be achieved this period. The impact to the fire on second quarter sales and earnings was approximately EUR 6.5 million and EUR 2.5 million respectively. We anticipate recovery of about 2 million from insurance during this period. We are expanding commercial sheet vinyl sales and that will improve our mix. During the period, our panel sales and margins expanded as we implemented many actions to enhance our results. Our installation volumes increased significantly offset by currency changes and lower prices as material costs declined. The integration of Xtratherm and our legacy installation business continues with sales, administrations and systems being realigned to enhance our results. I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

In the third quarter, we'll have 1 less day compared to last year. Plant disruptions temporarily pushed sales down by approximately $9 million in the quarter. We had a negative FX impact of $16 million with the decline in the ruble and the peso offsetting the positive impact of the euro. All segments grew with the strongest performance in our Rest of World segment. Our gross margin, as reported, was 32.7% or 32.8% excluding charges, up 180 basis points over last year. Volume and productivity were the biggest drivers for our improvement. SG&A, as reported, was $405 million or 17.5% sales. It was $402 million excluding charges or 17.4% of sales, which was 20 basis points higher than last year. Marketing investments, primarily in the ceramic and Flooring North American segments continued during the quarter. We expect SG&A percent to net sales to decline in the second half as spending slows and we leverage our cost better with higher sales.
Operating income as reported was $351 million with a margin of 15.2%. We had restructuring charges of $6 million related primarily to woven carpet consolidation in our North American segment.
We estimate another $20 million to $25 million of charges in the second half of this year. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 15.4%, which is up 160 basis points even with a $4 million foreign exchange headwind.
The operating increase over last year was impacted primarily by positive volume at $46 million and productivity at $41 million offsetting SG&A investments of $18 million.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which improved $7 million as higher rate volumes were refinanced last year -- this year under our CP program. Other income was $5 million and includes favorable FX. Our income tax rate was 26% this year compared to 24% last year and we are estimating our full year rate at 25%. Earnings per share, as reported, were $3.42. Earnings per share, excluding charges, was $3.47, up 29% over last year. Moving to the segments in our Global Ceramic segment. Sales, as reported, was $830 million which is a 5% increase over last year. Our legacy business is up 4% on a constant days and FX basis. We had a very strong local currency growth in Russia, with both North America and Europe also growing.
FX was a $16 million headwind in this segment. In Europe, our premium products experienced the strongest growth. Operating income, as reported, was $141 million or a margin of 16.9%. The operating margin, excluding charges, was 17%, an increase of 140 basis points. Operating income growth was driven by positive volume of $12 million and productivity of $14 million, offsetting $6 million of SG&A investments.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales, as reported, were $981 million, an increase of 7%. The legacy business using constant days was up slightly with a 1% increase. Hard surfaces and LVT sales, growth was the strongest. Operating income, as reported, was $119 million with a margin of 12.1%. The operating margin, excluding charges, was 12.8%, up 110 basis points. The operating income increased primarily from productivity of $22 million and input cost deflation of $9 million, offsetting the negative price mix of $9 million and another $9 million from SG&A investments.
And then finally, in our Flooring Rest of the World segments, sales as reported, were $500 million, up 51% with the legacy business, on a constant days and FX basis, up 5%. Both LVT and laminate had good growth in the quarter. The operating income as reported was $101 million with a margin of 20.2%. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 20.1% and was an increase of 160 basis points. Operating income was positively impacted by volume of $28 million with lower input cost of $8 million and productivity of $6 million.
If you look at the Corporate Elimination segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million and we expect a full year loss of about $35 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Receivables ended at $1.4 billion with our days sales outstanding up to 54 days from 52 days last year. This was primarily due to channel mix. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $1,000,000,007. [ph] Inventory days continued to show good improvement with 105 days this year compared to 106 days last year. Fixed assets were $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We had capital expenditures in the second quarter of $136 million, and depreciation and amortization of $101 million. CapEx for the fiscal year is estimated to be between $600 million to $650 million for the year and depreciation and amortization of $410 million. Long-term debt ended up at $3 billion with our leverage at 1.8x debt to pro forma EBITDA. Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you."

Our strategy is and has been to aggressively drive our business growth and profits through our capital allocations. And to tell you the truth, I'm really not sure that our ability to do that has been fully recognized by the entire market. Prior to 2016, we invested about $5 billion into the business, which is why we've been doing so well and expect to continue doing well. Of that, about $1.5 billion was into our existing assets and about $3.5 billion was in to 9 other acquisitions. With those things, the payback's range from the short end of 2 years for some of the capital to the long end of about 5 years with most things and the difference in doing some of the internal pieces is when you go into big projects, it can take 1 year to 1.5 years to get it go on another year to bring it up to a level so you don't get as much return in the first year or 2 but over the IRR, over the 5 and 10-year period is usually much greater along with lower risk. At the same time during those things, we have investing as the business got stronger. We start investing more in SG&A and most of the businesses to drive it and with the investments we're putting in, we get about $1 billion to $1.4 billion what we said as additional sales, we have to be bringing up the SG&A in order to support those things and it goes in before you actually get the sales results when you get through. From there going forward, in 2016, we've announced we're going to invest over $600 million. It's going in the same things of new products, increasing efficiencies and giving us more capacity in all of our different businesses. Again, these investments are the ones that give us a highest return in what we believe to be the lowest risk of various opportunities. Today, the fastest-growing part of the foreign industry is LVT as we just went through before. We'll have over $1 billion of capacity to support this in the U.S. and Europe so we think we're well-positioned. Our plants are more automated than others that are in there and more integrated forwards and backwards in order to make it at lower cost and give us a high flexibility to make what ever the customer wants. With this, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities are on the world.

Our business, in connection with the rest of our businesses, we can make any product in Russia you can get from anywhere. So over the time, what happened is we -- our business has been expanding in the midst of a huge recession, it's going on over there. We've also been expanding to -- we have expanded the product offering with more style and design at different price points, and we've also been expanding our distribution points. I don't know if you remember, we also have over 300 either owned or franchised retail stores that we've put through there, as well as our own total national distribution system over there. In addition, because of these things, we're the only company over there that has a consumer brand. So with all this, we've been running our assets wide open at the moment. This year, we've actually increased the capacities coming on in the fall of this year because we've ran out of porcelain capacity as we speak today and that's coming in over the next -- this period wr in right now. And then the market is really close to looking like it's bottoming soon. So it takes us about almost a year and a half to 2 years to get new capacity in. So we ordered, right now, in order to be able to sustain the growth after 2017, we have to have some our capacity so that's what we've ordered and it's coming in. If the market picks up, we know the market's going to pick up somewhere, it's really low from where it is, it's got to pickup. Our distribution has been broaden so we're really ready ready for it.

Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. Thi",1918,"Thank you, Frank. Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. This marks the ninth consecutive period that Mohawk has delivered record adjusted earnings per share. Our strategic business initiatives and our acquisitions all contributed to our rise in earnings. 
For the quarter, our operating margin grew 270 basis points to a second quarter record of 15.2% as a result of productivity, sales volume, acquisitions and lower input costs, offset partially by investments in SG&A and unfavorable price mix. Our revenues for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 13%, our highest quarterly revenues ever. During the period, we generated free cash flow of more than $270 million. 
Our innovations in products and processes, investments and efficiencies and integration of our acquisitions enhanced our performance during the quarter and provided a foundation for long-term growth. Our recent acquisitions are progressing, as we broaden their strategies, leverage their distribution and provide additional resources. Across the enterprise, we're investing in marketing to improve our product introductions and expand our distribution in sales. We anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales will improve as we progress through this year. To optimize our businesses, we have initiated many capital projects to enhance our performance this year and beyond by expanding our capacity, product offering and efficiencies. We're in the final stages of the startup of our new U.S. ceramic, LVT and outdoor rug operations as well as our European LVT plant. We've begun additional projects to support our growth, including LVT and laminate in the U.S. and Europe, ceramic in Mexico, Italy and Russia, Continuum polyester carpet, engineered wood and utility mats in the U.S. This year, we anticipate our capital expenditures will exceed $600 million depending on the timing of payments.
Consumer spending at the end of the second quarter strengthened the U.S. economy. The most recent National Association of Builders report affirmed continuing recovery of the U.S. single-family home market, continued job creation, new household formations and low mortgage rates to support housing growth throughout this year. Harvard's LIRA index projects remodeling activity will approach its 2006 peak in the middle of next year. The latest Architectural Billing (sic) [ Architecture Billings ] Index, which measures commercial design activity, rose to the highest level in almost a year. In Mexico, low inflation has raised consumer confidence to its highest level in a year and the comments are predicting further GDP growth. The European Central Bank continued to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing and low interest rates. The Russian economy remains in a recession, but there are indications it may be nearing a bottom. 
I'll now review our second quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic sales rose 5% as reported, with operating income for the segment growing 16% over last year to a margin of 17%. FX negatively impacted the translation of our sales from Mexico and Russia by $16 million. Our North American ceramic business continued to grow, and our margins benefited from higher volume, productivity and mix. The home construction channel outperformed the rest of the business, and we're expanding our position with builders across the country. Our new product introductions are gaining momentum and positively impacting our margins. We increased sales personnel and distribution points to optimize our market position. The introduction of some new account programs were postponed by large customers in the period and are back on track. Sales of our countertops are increasing, as we expand our distribution and product offering. We continue to enhance of the quality of our independent distributor network and have expanded American OEM Marazzi service centers on the West Coast. 
Our new Tennessee ceramic plant is ahead of schedule with the final production line becoming operational in the third quarter. We're manufacturing higher-value products at this facility, including 48-inch wood planks and color body porcelain tiles. The plant in Western Mexico that we acquired last year is improving its performance with higher production levels and lower costs. We're focusing each of our North American plants on specific products to optimize our productivity and increase their efficiency and quality. We are reengineering our product formulations and increasing the recycling of our ceramic waste. 
Our ceramic operating margins in Mexico expanded as we upgraded our mix and reduced our cost. All of our Mexican tile capacity is being utilized, and we have begun the expansion of our Salamanca plant. We will double its capacity by adding new lines that will be operational the fall of next year. We continue to grow our retail sales as well as our participation in DIY and new construction channels in Mexico. Our European ceramic sales continue to improve with expanded margins and improved mix. By upgrading our asset, enhancing our offering and improving our sales execution, we've increased revenue and profitability. To continue these trends, we're introducing more differentiated products in the middle price points and investing in retail merchandising, retail sales training and consumer advertising. 
We have initiated the final phase of our Italian asset modernization, which will be completed during the first half of next year. In addition, we've purchased a new manufacturing line to make even larger tiles to be used on floors, walls and countertops. We're enhancing our Bulgarian product offering, improving efficiencies and supplying product to our Western European and U.S. markets. 
Despite the continued decline of the Russian economy and ceramic industry, our sales rose significantly on a local basis with improvement in volume, price and mix. We're increasing our market share through industry-leading design and broader distribution. We've started up a new line to give us more porcelain production to satisfy our growing demand. We've enhanced the strength of our organization and broadened our sales and manufacturing capability. We are further expanding our capacity to prepare for a stronger Russian market in 2018.
For the second quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7%, with operating income for the segment increasing 25% to a margin of 12% as reported. Operating income grew 16% over last year to a margin of 13%, excluding unusual charges. The segment's profitability improved as we increased investments in sales personnel, retail merchandising and samples. Like ceramic, some large customers postponed product launches and reduced inventory in the period, and we anticipate sales improvement in the third quarter.
Our residential carpet margins expanded as a result of our differentiated products, process innovation and investments that lowered our cost structure. During the quarter, the industry's average selling price for residential carpet declined due to the shift to polyester and the lower cost of materials. Our mix was negatively impacted by the strength of the new home and multifamily channels, which utilize lower-value products. To satisfy the changing carpet market, we're adding more Continuum polyester production, which uses recycled materials to provide higher quality and value.
We widened the distribution of our SmartStrand carpet, Karastan broadloom and Mainstreet Commercial collections, which outpaced our other residential sales. Our exclusive SmartStrand franchise is being benefited by our new Silk naturals collection, which has the appearance of wool, but is softer, more luxurious and easier to maintain. We continue to strengthen our manufacturing performance with many process advances, higher yields and material enhancements. Our commercial carpet sales increased as we strengthened our product offering and expanded our sales in all channels. Our innovative commercial introductions received multiple awards at the recent show and gained interest from architects and designers who attended. We continue to simplify our manufacturing, consolidate plans and improve our planning processes. We're enhancing the design and value we provide to our customers while increasing our margins at the same time. All of our commercial channels are showing improvement with hospitality and senior living the strongest. 
Our new innovations in laminate are differentiating our products and expanding our market share. We continue to deliver unique styling and performance features in our laminate collections. Our European operations are providing product to the U.S. until our new capacity is operational next year. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow and we announced a price increase that will be implemented in the third quarter. By the end of this year, we will install more engineered wood production to satisfy greater demand and produce higher-value products. There is pressure on the solid wood sales as consumer preference shifts to engineered.
In June, we had a disruption in our Virginia wood plant, which impacted sales by $2 million. And we're now getting back to normal levels. Our vinyl business continued to expand as we increased the product assortment and distribution of our LVT and sheet vinyl. Our growth in LVT category has been constrained by our manufacturing capacity. We have recently made equipment modifications that will significantly raise our LVT production and reduce costs. We are preparing to introduce new designs and features to further grow our LVT sales in both residential and commercial. By the end of the year -- by the end of next year, we will double our U.S. LVT capacity and enhance our capabilities in this fast-growing category.
For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up 51% with operating income rising 91% to a margin of 20% as reported. Operating income grew 67% to a margin of 21% on a local basis excluding charges. Our Flooring business improved significantly, led by premium laminate and LVT. Our laminate mix benefited from our sales of our new collections featuring more realistic visuals and water resistance. We're adding laminate capacity in Europe to support the next generation of this unique technology. To offset currency fluctuations, we're announcing selective price increases. The system integration for Balterio Laminate will be completed during the third quarter and allow us to realize additional synergies. In Russia, our laminate facility continues to be fully utilized, and we're exploring options to add capacity. The mix of our wood business improved during the period, offset by negative currency. Higher sales of whiter wood increased our material costs, and we are raising prices to offset. We're reducing our wood SKUs and driving productivity and quality. 
Our LVT sales and margins increased as our mix and efficiencies improved. To support our LVT growth, additional equipment is being installed there also to raise our capacity, and we are sourcing products to supplement in the meantime. To satisfy future LVT growth, another production line should be operational by the end of the year.
Our sheet vinyl sales were negatively affected by a fire in our Belgium plant that we reviewed last quarter. The operations are presently running about 95% and -- of our expected rate, and full production will be achieved this period. The impact of the fire on second quarter sales and earnings was approximately EUR 6.5 million and EUR 2.5 million, respectively. We anticipate recovery of about EUR 2 million from insurance during this period. We are expanding commercial sheet vinyl sales, and that will improve our mix. During the period, our panel sales and margins expanded as we implemented many actions to enhance our results. Our installation volumes increased significantly, offset by currency changes and lower prices as material costs declined. The integration of Xtratherm in our legacy insulation business continues with sales, administration and systems being realigned to enhance our results. 
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

We have one additional day in the second quarter, and we'll also have one additional day in the fourth quarter. I",847,"Thank you, Jeff. Net sales as reported were $2,310,000,000, up 13%. Our legacy business was up 3% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We have one additional day in the second quarter, and we'll also have one additional day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we'll have one less day compared to last year. Plant disruptions temporarily pushed sales down by approximately $9 million in the quarter. We had a negative FX impact of $16 million, with the decline in the ruble and the peso offsetting the positive impact of the euro. All segments grew with the strongest performance in our Rest of World segment. Our gross margin as reported was 32.7% or 32.8%, excluding charges, up 180 basis points over last year. Volume and productivity were the biggest drivers for our improvement. SG&A, as reported, was $405 million or 17.5% of sales. It was $402 million excluding charges or 17.4% of sales, which was 20 basis points higher than last year. 
Marketing investments, primarily in ceramic and Flooring North American segments, continued during the quarter. We expect the SG&A percent to net sales to decline in the second half as spending slows and we leverage our cost better with higher sales.  Operating income as reported was $351 million with a margin of 15.2%. We had restructuring charges of $6 million related primarily to the woven carpet consolidation in our North American segment. We estimate another $20 million to $25 million of charges in the second half of this year. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.4%, which is up 160 basis points even with a $4 million foreign exchange headwind. The operating increase over last year was impacted primarily by positive volume at $46 million and productivity at $41 million, offsetting SG&A investments of $18 million.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which improved $7 million as higher rate bonds were refinanced last year under our -- this year under our CP program. Other income was $5 million and includes favorable FX. Our income tax rate was 26% this year compared to 24% last year, and we are estimating our full year rate at 25%. Earnings per share, as reported, were $3.42. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.47, up 29% over last year. 
Moving to the segments. In our Global Ceramic segment, sales as reported were $830 million, which is a 5% increase over last year. Our legacy business is up 4% on a constant days and FX basis. We had very strong local currency growth in Russia, with both North America and Europe also growing. FX was a $16 million headwind in this segment. In Europe, our premium products experienced the strongest growth. Operating income as reported was $141 million or a margin of 16.9%. The operating margin excluding charges was 17%, an increase of 140 basis points. Operating income growth was driven by positive volume of $12 million and productivity of $14 million, offsetting $6 million of SG&A investments.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $981 million, an increase of 7%. The legacy business using constant days was up slightly with a 1% increase. Hard surfaces and LVT sales, growth was the strongest. Operating income as reported was $119 million with a margin of 12.1%. The operating margin excluding charges was 12.8%, up 110 basis points. The operating income increased primarily from productivity of $22 million and input cost deflation of $9 million, offsetting the negative price mix of $9 million and another $9 million from SG&A investments.
And then finally, in our Flooring Rest of the World segment, sales as reported were $500 million, up 51%, with the legacy business on a constant days and FX basis up 5%. Both LVT and laminate had good growth in the quarter. The operating income as reported was $101 million with a margin of 20.2%. Our operating margin excluding charges was 20.1% and was an increase of 160 basis points. Operating income was positively impacted by volume of $28 million with lower input cost of $8 million and productivity of $6 million.
If you look at the corporate and eliminations segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect a full year loss of about $35 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Receivables ended at $1.4 billion with our days sales outstanding up to 54 days from 52 days last year. This was primarily due to channel mix. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $1,000,000,007. Inventory days continue to show good improvement with 105 days this year compared to 106 days last year. Fixed assets were $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We had capital expenditures in the second quarter of $136 million and depreciation and amortization of $101 million. CapEx for the fiscal year is estimated to be between $600 million to $650 million for the year and depreciation and amortization of $410 million. Long-term debt ended up at $3 billion with our leverage at 1.8x debt-to-pro forma EBITDA. 
Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you."

We're optimistic about our future performance as a result of our ongoing investments and people products and assets. Our current booking trends have improved, and we anticipate third quarter sales growth will be higher on a local basis. We expect continued margin expansion in all of our segments due to process improvement, operational innovations and greater efficiencies. Across the business, we're introducing differentiated products and leveraging customer relationships to increase our market position. We're making significant investments to expand our capacity in gross sales in all of our products and geographies. Our LVT sales growth is accelerating, and our new plants are making gains in capacity, productivity and efficiency. Taking these factors into account, our EPS guidance for the third quarter is $3.40 to $3.49. This represents a 14% to 17% increase over third quarter 2015 EPS, excluding any restructuring charges.
From 2013 through 2016, we will have invested over $2 billion in new assets to drive Mohawk's profitability. We have substantially integrated our recent acquisitions. And with our strong organization and balance sheet, we can exploit additional opportunity. In every region, our differentiated product collections, operational excellence and extensive customer relationships give us advantages, so we can deliver stronger results. We'll now be glad to take any questions."

We've just made -- when we put the plant in, we didn't put in all the things that took to optimize the capacity, because we weren't sure what we didn't know. We've recently added more capacity to feed it, which is going to up the production levels as we speak in Europe. And the U.S. plant was a totally different technology than the other 2, which ran about 50%, 60% faster over there. It's also in its final stages of startup. We've been making modifications to it, and over the 4th of July, we've made additional changes to it to try to get it to what we believe to be is optimum capacity later in the fall of this year. In addition to those, we are in the process or I have ordered pieces of equipment to open the next generation of the United States plant that will run even better and have more capabilities, and we've got to put another line in the United States and into Europe, both of which should be running by the end of next year [indiscernible] to grow the business.

Our strategy is and has been to aggressively drive our business growth and profits through our capital allocations. And to tell you the truth, I'm really not sure that our ability to do that has been fully recognized by the entire market. Prior to 2016, we invested about $5 billion into the business, which is why we've been doing so well and expect to continue doing well. Of that, about $1.5 billion was into our existing assets and about $3.5 billion was in to 9 other acquisitions. With those things, the paybacks range from the short end of 2 years for some of the capital to the long end of about 5 years with the most things. And the difference in doing some of the internal pieces is when you go into big projects, it can take 1 year to 1.5 years to get it going another year to bring it up to a level, so you don't get as much return in the first year or 2. But over the IRR, over the 5 and 10-year period is usually much greater is it along with lower risk. At the same time during those things, we have investing -- as the business got stronger, we started investing more in SG&A and most of the businesses to drive it. And with the investments we're putting in, we get about $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion is what we said of additional sales. We have to be bringing up the SG&A in order to support those things, and it goes in before you actually get the sales results when you get through. From there going forward, in 2016, we've announced we're going to invest over $600 million. It's going in the same things of new products, increasing efficiencies and giving us more capacity in all of our different businesses. The -- again, these investments are the ones that give us the highest return in what we believe to be the lowest risk of our various opportunities. Today, the fastest growing part of flooring industry is the LVT. As we just went through before, we'll have over $1 billion of capacity to support this in the U.S. and Europe. So we think we're well positioned. Our plants are more automated than others that are in there, and they're more integrated forward and backwards in order to make it at lower cost and give us high flexibility to make whatever the customer wants. With this, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities around the world. We remain disciplined in our approach to get good returns on those, and the organization's ability to identify and execute these opportunities is really what sets us apart."

Our business, in connection with the rest of our businesses, we can make any product in Russia you can get from anywhere. So over that time, what's happened is we -- our business has been expanding in the midst of a huge recession that's going on over there. We've also been expanding the -- so we have expanded the product offering with more style and design at different price points, and we've also been expanding our distribution points. I don't know if you remember, we also have over 300 either owned or franchise retail stores that we've put through there as well as our own total national distribution system over there. In addition, because of these things, we're the only company over there that has a consumer brand. So with all this, we've been running our assets wide open at the moment. This year, we've actually increased the capacities coming on in the fall of this year, because we've run out of porcelain capacity as we speak today, and that's coming in over the next -- this period we're in right now. And then the market is really close to looking like it's bottoming soon. So it takes us about almost 1.5 years to 2 years to get new capacity in. So we've ordered -- right now in order to be able to sustain the growth after 2017, we have to have some more capacity. So that's what we've ordered and it's coming in. If the market picks up -- we know the market is going to pick up somewhere. It's really low from where it is. It's got to pickup. Our distribution has been broadened, so we're really ready ready for it. And there's a chance that we could be a little early or we could be a little late.

Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. Thi",1919,"Thank you, Frank. Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. This marks the ninth consecutive period that Mohawk has delivered record adjusted earnings per share. Our strategic business initiatives and our acquisitions all contributed to our rise in earnings. 
For the quarter, our operating margin grew 270 basis points to a second quarter record of 15.2% as a result of productivity, sales volume, acquisitions and lower input costs, offset partially by investments in SG&A and unfavorable price mix. Our revenues for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 13%, our highest quarterly revenues ever. During the period, we generated free cash flow of more than $270 million. 
Our innovations in products and processes, investments and efficiencies and integration of our acquisitions enhanced our performance during the quarter and provided a foundation for long-term growth. Our recent acquisitions are progressing, as we broaden their strategies, leverage their distribution and provide additional resources. Across the enterprise, we're investing in marketing to improve our product introductions and expand our distribution in sales. We anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales will improve as we progress through this year. To optimize our businesses, we have initiated many capital projects that will enhance our performance this year and beyond by expanding our capacity, product offering and efficiencies. We're in the final stages of the startup of our new U.S. ceramic, LVT and outdoor rug operations as well as our European LVT plant. We've begun additional projects to support our growth, including LVT and laminate in the U.S. and Europe, ceramic in Mexico, Italy and Russia, Continuum polyester carpet, engineered wood and utility mats in the U.S. This year, we anticipate our capital expenditures will exceed $600 million depending on the timing of payments.
Consumer spending at the end of the second quarter strengthened the U.S. economy. The most recent National Association of Builders report affirmed continuing recovery of the U.S. single-family home market, continued job creation, new household formations and low mortgage rates to support housing growth throughout this year. Harvard's LIRA index projects remodeling activity will approach its 2006 (sic) peak in the middle of next year. The latest Architectural Billing (sic) [ Architecture Billings ] Index, which measures commercial design activity, rose to the highest level in almost a year. In Mexico, low inflation has raised consumer confidence to its highest level in a year and the comments are predicting further GDP growth. The European Central Bank continued to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing and low interest rates. The Russian economy remains in a recession, but there are indications it may be nearing a bottom. 
I'll now review our second quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic sales rose 5% as reported, with operating income for the segment growing 16% over last year to a margin of 17%. FX negatively impacted the translation of our sales from Mexico and Russia by $16 million. Our North American ceramic business continued to grow, and our margins benefited from higher volume, productivity and mix. The home construction channel outperformed the rest of the business, and we're expanding our position with builders across the country. Our new product introductions are gaining momentum and positively impacting our margins. We increased sales personnel and distribution points to optimize our market position. The introduction of some new tile programs were postponed by large customers in the period and are back on track. Sales of our countertops are increasing, as we expand our distribution and product offering. We continue to enhance the quality of our independent distributor network and have expanded American OEM Marazzi service centers on the West Coast. 
Our new Tennessee ceramic plant is ahead of schedule with the final production line becoming operational in the third quarter. We're manufacturing higher-value products at this facility, including 48-inch wood planks and color body porcelain tiles. The plant in Western Mexico that we acquired last year is improving its performance with higher production levels and lower costs. We're focusing each of our North American plants on specific products to optimize our productivity and increase their efficiency and quality. We are reengineering our product formulations and increasing the recycling of our ceramic waste. 
Our ceramic operating margins in Mexico expanded as we upgraded our mix and reduced our cost. All of our Mexican tile capacity is being utilized, and we have begun the expansion of our Salamanca plant. We will double its capacity by adding new lines that will be operational the fall of next year. We continue to grow our retail sales as well as our participation in DIY and new construction channels in Mexico. Our European ceramic sales continue to improve with expanded margins and improved mix. By upgrading our asset, enhancing our offering and improving our sales execution, we've increased revenue and profitability. To continue these trends, we're introducing more differentiated products in the middle price points and investing in retail merchandising, retail sales training and consumer advertising. 
We have initiated the final phase of our Italian asset modernization, which will be completed during the first half of next year. In addition, we've purchased a new manufacturing line to make even larger tiles to be used on floors, walls and countertops. We're enhancing our Bulgarian product offering, improving efficiencies and supplying product to our Western European and U.S. markets. 
Despite the continued decline of the Russian economy and ceramic industry, our sales rose significantly on a local basis with improvement in volume, price and mix. We're increasing our market share through industry-leading design and broader distribution. We've started up a new line to give us more porcelain production to satisfy our growing demand. We've enhanced the strength of our organization and broadened our sales and manufacturing capability. We are further expanding our capacity to prepare for a stronger Russian market in 2018.
For the second quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7%, with operating income for the segment increasing 25% to a margin of 12% as reported. Operating income grew 16% over last year to a margin of 13%, excluding unusual charges. The segment's profitability improved as we increased investments in sales personnel, retail merchandising and samples. Like ceramic, some large customers postponed product launches and reduced inventory in the period, and we anticipate sales improvement in the third quarter.
Our residential carpet margins expanded as a result of our differentiated products, process innovation and investments that lowered our cost structure. During the quarter, the industry's average selling price for residential carpet declined due to the shift to polyester and the lower cost of materials. Our mix was negatively impacted by the strength of the new home and multifamily channels, which utilize lower-value products. To satisfy the changing carpet market, we're adding more Continuum polyester production, which uses recycled materials to provide higher quality and value.
We widened the distribution of our SmartStrand carpet, Karastan broadloom and Mainstreet Commercial collections, which outpaced our other residential sales. Our exclusive SmartStrand franchise is being benefited by our new Silk naturals collection, which has the appearance of wool, but is softer, more luxurious and easier to maintain. We continue to strengthen our manufacturing performance with many process advances, higher yields and material enhancements. Our commercial carpet sales increased as we strengthened our product offering and expanded our sales in all channels. Our innovative commercial introductions received multiple awards at the recent show and gained interest from architects and designers who attended. We continue to simplify our manufacturing, consolidate plans and improve our planning processes. We're enhancing the design and value we provide to our customers while increasing our margins at the same time. All of our commercial channels are showing improvement with hospitality and senior living the strongest. 
Our new innovations in laminate are differentiating our products and expanding our market share. We continue to deliver unique styling and performance features in our laminate collections. Our European operations are providing product to the U.S. until our new capacity is operational next year. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow and we announced a price increase that will be implemented in the third quarter. By the end of this year, we will install more engineered wood production to satisfy greater demand and produce higher-value products. There is pressure on the solid wood sales as consumer preference shifts to engineered.
In June, we had a disruption in our Virginia wood plant, which impacted sales by $2 million. And we're now getting back to normal levels. Our vinyl business continued to expand as we increased the product assortment and distribution of our LVT and sheet vinyl. Our growth in LVT category has been constrained by our manufacturing capacity. We have recently made equipment modifications that will significantly raise our LVT production and reduce costs. We are preparing to introduce new designs and features to further grow our LVT sales in both residential and commercial. By the end of the year -- by the end of next year, we will double our U.S. LVT capacity and enhance our capabilities in this fast-growing category.
For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up 51% with operating income rising 91% to a margin of 20% as reported. Operating income grew 67% to a margin of 21% on a local basis excluding charges. Our Flooring business improved significantly, led by premium laminate and LVT. Our laminate mix benefited from our sales of our new collections featuring more realistic visuals and water resistance. We're adding laminate capacity in Europe to support the next generation of this unique technology. To offset currency fluctuations, we're announcing selective price increases. The system integration for Balterio Laminate will be completed during the third quarter and allow us to realize additional synergies. In Russia, our laminate facility continues to be fully utilized, and we're exploring options to add capacity. The mix of our wood business improved during the period, offset by negative currency. Higher sales of wider wood increased our material costs, and we are raising prices to offset. We're reducing our wood SKUs and driving productivity and quality. 
Our LVT sales and margins increased as our mix and efficiencies improved. To support our LVT growth, additional equipment is being installed there also to raise our capacity, and we are sourcing products to supplement in the meantime. To satisfy future LVT growth, another production line should be operational by the end of the year.
Our sheet vinyl sales were negatively affected by a fire in our Belgium plant that we reviewed last quarter. The operations are presently running about 95% and -- of our expected rate, and full production will be achieved this period. The impact of the fire on second quarter sales and earnings was approximately EUR 6.5 million and EUR 2.5 million, respectively. We anticipate recovery of about EUR 2 million from insurance during this period. We are expanding commercial sheet vinyl sales, and that will improve our mix. During the period, our panel sales and margins expanded as we implemented many actions to enhance our results. Our installation volumes increased significantly, offset by currency changes and lower prices as material costs declined. The integration of Xtratherm in our legacy insulation business continues with sales, administration and systems being realigned to enhance our results. 
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Our legacy business was up 3% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had one additional day in the second quarter, and we'll also have one additional day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we'll have one less day compared to last year. Plant disruptions temporarily pushed sales down by approximately $9 million in the quarter. We had a negative FX impact of $16 million, with the decline in the ruble and the peso offsetting the positive impact of the euro. All segments grew with the strongest performance in our Rest of World segment. Our gross margin as reported was 32.7% or 32.8%, excluding charges, up 180 basis points over last year. Volume and productivity were the biggest drivers for our improvement. SG&A, as reported, was $405 million or 17.5% of sales. It was $402 million excluding charges or 17.4% of sales, which was 20 basis points higher than last year. 
Marketing investments, primarily in ceramic and Flooring North American segments, continued during the quarter. We expect the SG&A percent to net sales to decline in the second half as spending slows and we leverage our cost better with higher sales.  Operating income as reported was $351 million with a margin of 15.2%. We had restructuring charges of $6 million related primarily to the woven carpet consolidation in our North American segment. We estimate another $20 million to $25 million of charges in the second half of this year. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.4%, which is up 160 basis points even with a $4 million foreign exchange headwind. The operating increase over last year was impacted primarily by positive volume at $46 million and productivity at $41 million, offsetting SG&A investments of $18 million.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which improved $7 million as higher rate bonds were refinanced last year under our -- this year under our CP program. Other income was $5 million and includes favorable FX. Our income tax rate was 26% this year compared to 24% last year, and we are estimating our full year rate at 25%. Earnings per share, as reported, were $3.42. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.47, up 29% over last year. 
Moving to the segments. In our Global Ceramic segment, sales as reported were $830 million, which is a 5% increase over last year. Our legacy business is up 4% on a constant days and FX basis. We had very strong local currency growth in Russia, with both North America and Europe also growing. FX was a $16 million headwind in this segment. In Europe, our premium products experienced the strongest growth. Operating income as reported was $141 million or a margin of 16.9%. The operating margin excluding charges was 17%, an increase of 140 basis points. Operating income growth was driven by positive volume of $12 million and productivity of $14 million, offsetting $6 million of SG&A investments.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $981 million, an increase of 7%. The legacy business using constant days was up slightly with a 1% increase. Hard surfaces and LVT sales, growth was the strongest. Operating income as reported was $119 million with a margin of 12.1%. The operating margin excluding charges was 12.8%, up 110 basis points. The operating income increased primarily from productivity of $22 million and input cost deflation of $9 million, offsetting the negative price mix of $9 million and another $9 million from SG&A investments.
And then finally, in our Flooring Rest of the World segment, sales as reported were $500 million, up 51%, with the legacy business on a constant days and FX basis up 5%. Both LVT and laminate had good growth in the quarter. The operating income as reported was $101 million with a margin of 20.2%. Our operating margin excluding charges was 20.1% and was an increase of 160 basis points. Operating income was positively impacted by volume of $28 million with lower input cost of $8 million and productivity of $6 million.
If you look at the corporate and eliminations segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect a full year loss of about $35 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Receivables ended at $1.4 billion with our days sales outstanding up to 54 days from 52 days last year. This was primarily due to channel mix. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $1,000,000,007. Inventory days continue to show good improvement with 105 days this year compared to 106 days last year. Fixed assets were $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We had capital expenditures in the second quarter of $136 million and depreciation and amortization of $101 million. CapEx for the fiscal year is estimated to be between $600 million to $650 million for the year and depreciation and amortization of $410 million. Long-term debt ended up at $3 billion with our leverage at 1.8x debt-to-pro forma EBITDA.

We're optimistic about our future performance as a result of our ongoing investments and people products and assets. Our current booking trends have improved, and we anticipate third quarter sales growth will be higher on a local basis. We expect continued margin expansion in all of our segments due to process improvement, operational innovations and greater efficiencies. Across the business, we're introducing differentiated products and leveraging customer relationships to increase our market position. We're making significant investments to expand our capacity in gross sales in all of our products and geographies. Our LVT sales growth is accelerating, and our new plants are making gains in capacity, productivity and efficiency. Taking these factors into account, our EPS guidance for the third quarter is $3.40 to $3.49. This represents a 14% to 17% increase over third quarter 2015 EPS, excluding any restructuring charges.
From 2013 through 2016, we will have invested over $2 billion in new assets to drive Mohawk's profitability. We have substantially integrated our recent acquisitions. And with our strong organization and balance sheet, we can exploit additional opportunity. In every region, our differentiated product collections, operational excellence and extensive customer relationships give us advantages, so we can deliver stronger results. We'll now be glad to take any questions."

Our strategy is and has been to aggressively drive our business growth and profits through our capital allocations. And to tell you the truth, I'm really not sure that our ability to do that has been fully recognized by the entire market. Prior to 2016, we invested about $5 billion into the business, which is why we've been doing so well and expect to continue doing well. Of that, about $1.5 billion was into our existing assets and about $3.5 billion was in to 9 other acquisitions. With those things, the paybacks range from the short end of 2 years for some of the capital to the long end of about 5 years with the most things. And the difference in doing some of the internal pieces is when you go into big projects, it can take 1 year to 1.5 years to get it going another year to bring it up to a level, so you don't get as much return in the first year or 2. But over the IRR, over the 5 and 10-year period is usually much greater as it's along with lower risk. At the same time during those things, we have investing -- as the business got stronger, we started investing more in SG&A and most of the businesses to drive it. And with the investments we're putting in, we get about $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion is what we said of additional sales. We have to be bringing up the SG&A in order to support those things, and it goes in before you actually get the sales results when you get through. From there going forward, in 2016, we've announced we're going to invest over $600 million. It's going in the same things of new products, increasing efficiencies and giving us more capacity in all of our different businesses. The -- again, these investments are the ones that give us the highest return at what we believe to be the lowest risk of our various opportunities. [indiscernible] Today, the fastest growing part of flooring industry is the LVT. As we just went through before, we'll have over $1 billion of capacity to support this in the U.S. and Europe. So we think we're well positioned. Our plants are more automated than others that are in there, and they're more integrated forward and backwards in order to make it at lower cost and give us high flexibility to make whatever the customer wants. With this, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities around the world. We remain disciplined in our approach to get good returns on those, and the organization's ability to identify and execute these opportunities is really what sets us apart."

So the first thing that happened was the imports coming into Russia declined first, and they're headed close to 0 if they're not already. Now in that environment, the imports we're supplying, the mid-to high-end part of the marketplace. We are positioned in the mid- to high-end part of the marketplace, and so we became the best option to replace it. Our business, in connection with the rest of our businesses, we can make any product in Russia you can get from anywhere. So over that time, what's happened is we -- our business has been expanding in the midst of a huge recession that's going on over there. We've also been expanding the -- so we have expanded the product offering with more style and design at different price points, and we've also been expanding our distribution points. I don't know if you remember, we also have over 300 either owned or franchise retail stores that we've put through there as well as our own total national distribution system over there. In addition, because of these things, we're the only company over there that has a consumer brand. So with all this, we've been running our assets wide open at the moment. This year, we've actually increased the capacities coming on in the fall of this year, because we've run out of porcelain capacity as we speak today, and that's coming in over the next -- this period we're in right now. And then the market is really close to looking like it's bottoming soon. So it takes us about almost 1.5 years to 2 years to get new capacity in. So we've ordered -- right now in order to be able to sustain the growth after 2017, we have to have some more capacity. So that's what we've ordered and it's coming in. If the market picks up -- we know the market is going to pick up somewhere. It's really low from where it is. It's got to pickup. Our distribution has been broadened, so we're really ready ready for it. And there's a chance that we could be a little early or we could be a little late.

I'm guessing that the wood -- the total wood volume, if you look at the year, we're guessing somewhere in the 3% to 4% range for the industry.

We saw it as an adjunct to our ceramic business, and we've become the largest distributor of countertops in the country. It's a very fractured business as a distribution business with a lot of small people in regional places and because we cover most of the United States, but not all of it with it. So it's an opportunity to grow our business as a broad distribution company. We've been able to leverage our relationships with ceramic and stone flooring to build a nice business that we have. And we see opportunities to expand the position into more distribution and look at the other opportunities within it. There are, for instance, in Europe, there is a porcelain countertop being made similar to ceramic tile, and we're actually putting in capacity. I mentioned earlier, they actually make it in Europe. So once we put that in, which should be sometime next year, we'll start importing it and selling it through our own distribution, as a for instance."

Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. Thi",1918,"Thank you, Frank. Our second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations. Our earnings per share for the period were $3.42, an increase of 35% or $3.47 excluding unusual charges, an increase of 29% over last year and an all-time record for the company. This marks the ninth consecutive period that Mohawk has delivered record adjusted earnings per share. Our strategic business initiatives and our acquisitions all contributed to our rise in earnings. 
For the quarter, our operating margin grew 270 basis points to a second quarter record of 15.2% as a result of productivity, sales volume, acquisitions and lower input costs, offset partially by investments in SG&A and unfavorable price mix. Our revenues for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 13%, our highest quarterly revenues ever. During the period, we generated free cash flow of more than $270 million. 
Our innovations in products and processes, investments and efficiencies and integration of our acquisitions enhanced our performance during the quarter and provided a foundation for long-term growth. Our recent acquisitions are progressing, as we broaden their strategies, leverage their distribution and provide additional resources. Across the enterprise, we're investing in marketing to improve our product introductions and expand our distribution in sales. We anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales will improve as we progress through this year. To optimize our businesses, we have initiated many capital projects that will enhance our performance this year and beyond by expanding our capacity, product offering and efficiencies. We're in the final stages of the startup of our new U.S. ceramic, LVT and outdoor rug operations as well as our European LVT plant. We've begun additional projects to support our growth, including LVT and laminate in the U.S. and Europe, ceramic in Mexico, Italy and Russia, Continuum polyester carpet, engineered wood and utility mats in the U.S. This year, we anticipate our capital expenditures will exceed $600 million depending on the timing of payments.
Consumer spending at the end of the second quarter strengthened the U.S. economy. The most recent National Association of Builders report affirmed continuing recovery of the U.S. single-family home market, continued job creation, new household formations and low mortgage rates to support housing growth throughout this year. Harvard's LIRA index projects remodeling activity will approach its 2006 peak in the middle of next year. The latest Architectural Billing (sic) [ Architecture Billings ] Index, which measures commercial design activity, rose to the highest level in almost a year. In Mexico, low inflation has raised consumer confidence to its highest level in a year and the comments are predicting further GDP growth. The European Central Bank continued to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing and low interest rates. The Russian economy remains in a recession, but there are indications it may be nearing a bottom. 
I'll now review our second quarter performance by segment. Our Global Ceramic sales rose 5% as reported, with operating income for the segment growing 16% over last year to a margin of 17%. FX negatively impacted the translation of our sales from Mexico and Russia by $16 million. Our North American ceramic business continued to grow, and our margins benefited from higher volume, productivity and mix. The home construction channel outperformed the rest of the business, and we're expanding our position with builders across the country. Our new product introductions are gaining momentum and positively impacting our margins. We increased sales personnel and distribution points to optimize our market position. The introduction of some new tile programs were postponed by large customers in the period and are back on track. Sales of our countertops are increasing, as we expand our distribution and product offering. We continue to enhance the quality of our independent distributor network and have expanded American OEM Marazzi service centers on the West Coast. 
Our new Tennessee ceramic plant is ahead of schedule with the final production line becoming operational in the third quarter. We're manufacturing higher-value products at this facility, including 48-inch wood planks and color body porcelain tiles. The plant in Western Mexico that we acquired last year is improving its performance with higher production levels and lower costs. We're focusing each of our North American plants on specific products to optimize our productivity and increase their efficiency and quality. We are reengineering our product formulations and increasing the recycling of our ceramic waste. 
Our ceramic operating margins in Mexico expanded as we upgraded our mix and reduced our cost. All of our Mexican tile capacity is being utilized, and we have begun the expansion of our Salamanca plant. We will double its capacity by adding new lines that will be operational the fall of next year. We continue to grow our retail sales as well as our participation in DIY and new construction channels in Mexico. Our European ceramic sales continue to improve with expanded margins and improved mix. By upgrading our asset, enhancing our offering and improving our sales execution, we've increased revenue and profitability. To continue these trends, we're introducing more differentiated products in the middle price points and investing in retail merchandising, retail sales training and consumer advertising. 
We have initiated the final phase of our Italian asset modernization, which will be completed during the first half of next year. In addition, we've purchased a new manufacturing line to make even larger tiles to be used on floors, walls and countertops. We're enhancing our Bulgarian product offering, improving efficiencies and supplying product to our Western European and U.S. markets. 
Despite the continued decline of the Russian economy and ceramic industry, our sales rose significantly on a local basis with improvement in volume, price and mix. We're increasing our market share through industry-leading design and broader distribution. We've started up a new line to give us more porcelain production to satisfy our growing demand. We've enhanced the strength of our organization and broadened our sales and manufacturing capability. We are further expanding our capacity to prepare for a stronger Russian market in 2018.
For the second quarter, our Flooring North America segment sales were up 7%, with operating income for the segment increasing 25% to a margin of 12% as reported. Operating income grew 16% over last year to a margin of 13%, excluding unusual charges. The segment's profitability improved as we increased investments in sales personnel, retail merchandising and samples. Like ceramic, some large customers postponed product launches and reduced inventory in the period, and we anticipate sales improvement in the third quarter.
Our residential carpet margins expanded as a result of our differentiated products, process innovation and investments that lowered our cost structure. During the quarter, the industry's average selling price for residential carpet declined due to the shift to polyester and the lower cost of materials. Our mix was negatively impacted by the strength of the new home and multifamily channels, which utilize lower-value products. To satisfy the changing carpet market, we're adding more Continuum polyester production, which uses recycled materials to provide higher quality and value.
We widened the distribution of our SmartStrand carpet, Karastan broadloom and Mainstreet Commercial collections, which outpaced our other residential sales. Our exclusive SmartStrand franchise is being benefited by our new Silk naturals collection, which has the appearance of wool, but is softer, more luxurious and easier to maintain. We continue to strengthen our manufacturing performance with many process advances, higher yields and material enhancements. Our commercial carpet sales increased as we strengthened our product offering and expanded our sales in all channels. Our innovative commercial introductions received multiple awards at the recent show and gained interest from architects and designers who attended. We continue to simplify our manufacturing, consolidate plans and improve our planning processes. We're enhancing the design and value we provide to our customers while increasing our margins at the same time. All of our commercial channels are showing improvement with hospitality and senior living the strongest. 
Our new innovations in laminate are differentiating our products and expanding our market share. We continue to deliver unique styling and performance features in our laminate collections. Our European operations are providing product to the U.S. until our new capacity is operational next year. Our engineered wood sales continue to grow and we announced a price increase that will be implemented in the third quarter. By the end of this year, we will install more engineered wood production to satisfy greater demand and produce higher-value products. There is pressure on the solid wood sales as consumer preference shifts to engineered.
In June, we had a disruption in our Virginia wood plant, which impacted sales by $2 million. And we're now getting back to normal levels. Our vinyl business continued to expand as we increased the product assortment and distribution of our LVT and sheet vinyl. Our growth in LVT category has been constrained by our manufacturing capacity. We have recently made equipment modifications that will significantly raise our LVT production and reduce costs. We are preparing to introduce new designs and features to further grow our LVT sales in both residential and commercial. By the end of the year -- by the end of next year, we will double our U.S. LVT capacity and enhance our capabilities in this fast-growing category.
For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment sales were up 51% with operating income rising 91% to a margin of 20% as reported. Operating income grew 67% to a margin of 21% on a local basis excluding charges. Our Flooring business improved significantly, led by premium laminate and LVT. Our laminate mix benefited from our sales of our new collections featuring more realistic visuals and water resistance. We're adding laminate capacity in Europe to support the next generation of this unique technology. To offset currency fluctuations, we're announcing selective price increases. The system integration for Balterio Laminate will be completed during the third quarter and allow us to realize additional synergies. In Russia, our laminate facility continues to be fully utilized, and we're exploring options to add capacity. The mix of our wood business improved during the period, offset by negative currency. Higher sales of wider wood increased our material costs, and we are raising prices to offset. We're reducing our wood SKUs and driving productivity and quality. 
Our LVT sales and margins increased as our mix and efficiencies improved. To support our LVT growth, additional equipment is being installed there also to raise our capacity, and we are sourcing products to supplement in the meantime. To satisfy future LVT growth, another production line should be operational by the end of the year.
Our sheet vinyl sales were negatively affected by a fire in our Belgium plant that we reviewed last quarter. The operations are presently running about 95% and -- of our expected rate, and full production will be achieved this period. The impact of the fire on second quarter sales and earnings was approximately EUR 6.5 million and EUR 2.5 million, respectively. We anticipate recovery of about EUR 2 million from insurance during this period. We are expanding commercial sheet vinyl sales, and that will improve our mix. During the period, our panel sales and margins expanded as we implemented many actions to enhance our results. Our installation volumes increased significantly, offset by currency changes and lower prices as material costs declined. The integration of Xtratherm in our legacy insulation business continues with sales, administration and systems being realigned to enhance our results. 
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Our legacy business was up 3% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had one additional day in the second quarter, and we'll also have one additional day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we'll have one less day compared to last year. Plant disruptions temporarily pushed sales down by approximately $9 million in the quarter. We had a negative FX impact of $16 million, with the decline in the ruble and the peso offsetting the positive impact of the euro. All segments grew with the strongest performance in our Rest of World segment. Our gross margin as reported was 32.7% or 32.8%, excluding charges, up 180 basis points over last year. Volume and productivity were the biggest drivers for our improvement. SG&A, as reported, was $405 million or 17.5% of sales. It was $402 million excluding charges or 17.4% of sales, which was 20 basis points higher than last year. 
Marketing investments, primarily in ceramic and Flooring North American segments, continued during the quarter. We expect the SG&A percent to net sales to decline in the second half as spending slows and we leverage our cost better with higher sales. Operating income as reported was $351 million with a margin of 15.2%. We had restructuring charges of $6 million related primarily to the woven carpet consolidation in our North American segment. We estimate another $20 million to $25 million of charges in the second half of this year. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.4%, which is up 160 basis points even with a $4 million foreign exchange headwind. The operating increase over last year was impacted primarily by positive volume at $46 million and productivity at $41 million, offsetting SG&A investments of $18 million.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, which improved $7 million as higher rate bonds were refinanced last year under our -- this year under our CP program. Other income was $5 million and includes favorable FX. Our income tax rate was 26% this year compared to 24% last year, and we are estimating our full year rate at 25%. Earnings per share, as reported, were $3.42. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.47, up 29% over last year. 
Moving to the segments. In our Global Ceramic segment, sales as reported were $830 million, which is a 5% increase over last year. Our legacy business is up 4% on a constant days and FX basis. We had very strong local currency growth in Russia, with both North America and Europe also growing. FX was a $16 million headwind in this segment. In Europe, our premium products experienced the strongest growth. Operating income as reported was $141 million or a margin of 16.9%. The operating margin excluding charges was 17%, an increase of 140 basis points. Operating income growth was driven by positive volume of $12 million and productivity of $14 million, offsetting $6 million of SG&A investments.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $981 million, an increase of 7%. The legacy business using constant days was up slightly with a 1% increase. Hard surfaces and LVT sales, growth was the strongest. Operating income as reported was $119 million with a margin of 12.1%. The operating margin excluding charges was 12.8%, up 110 basis points. The operating income increased primarily from productivity of $22 million and input cost deflation of $9 million, offsetting the negative price mix of $9 million and another $9 million from SG&A investments.
And then finally, in our Flooring Rest of the World segment, sales as reported were $500 million, up 51%, with the legacy business on a constant days and FX basis up 5%. Both LVT and laminate had good growth in the quarter. The operating income as reported was $101 million with a margin of 20.2%. Our operating margin excluding charges was 20.1% and was an increase of 160 basis points. Operating income was positively impacted by volume of $28 million with lower input cost of $8 million and productivity of $6 million.
If you look at the corporate and eliminations segment, we had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect a full year loss of about $35 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Receivables ended at $1.4 billion with our days sales outstanding up to 54 days from 52 days last year. This was primarily due to channel mix. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $1,000,000,007. Inventory days continue to show good improvement with 105 days this year compared to 106 days last year. Fixed assets were $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We had capital expenditures in the second quarter of $136 million and depreciation and amortization of $101 million. CapEx for the fiscal year is estimated to be between $600 million to $650 million for the year and depreciation and amortization of $410 million. Long-term debt ended up at $3 billion with our leverage at 1.8x debt-to-pro forma EBITDA.

We're optimistic about our future performance as a result of our ongoing investments and people products and assets. Our current booking trends have improved, and we anticipate third quarter sales growth will be higher on a local basis. We expect continued margin expansion in all of our segments due to process improvement, operational innovations and greater efficiencies. Across the business, we're introducing differentiated products and leveraging customer relationships to increase our market position. We're making significant investments to expand our capacity in gross sales in all of our products and geographies. Our LVT sales growth is accelerating, and our new plants are making gains in capacity, productivity and efficiency. Taking these factors into account, our EPS guidance for the third quarter is $3.40 to $3.49. This represents a 14% to 17% increase over third quarter 2015 EPS, excluding any restructuring charges.
From 2013 through 2016, we will have invested over $2 billion in new assets to drive Mohawk's profitability. We have substantially integrated our recent acquisitions. And with our strong organization and balance sheet, we can exploit additional opportunity. In every region, our differentiated product collections, operational excellence and extensive customer relationships give us advantages, so we can deliver stronger results. We'll now be glad to take any questions."

We've been making modifications to it, and over the 4th of July, we've made additional changes to it to try to get it to what we believe to be is optimum capacity later in the fall of this year. In addition to those, we are in the process or have ordered pieces of equipment to open the next generation of the United States plant that will run even better and have more capabilities, and we're going to put another line in the United States and into Europe, both of which should be running by the end of next year that will enable us to grow the business.

Our strategy is and has been to aggressively drive our business growth and profits through our capital allocations. And to tell you the truth, I'm really not sure that our ability to do that has been fully recognized by the entire market. Prior to 2016, we invested about $5 billion into the business, which is why we've been doing so well and expect to continue doing well. Of that, about $1.5 billion was into our existing assets and about $3.5 billion was in to 9 other acquisitions. With those things, the paybacks range from the short end of 2 years for some of the capital to the long end of about 5 years with the most things. And the difference in doing some of the internal pieces is when you go into big projects, it can take 1 year to 1.5 years to get it going another year to bring it up to a level, so you don't get as much return in the first year or 2. But over the IRR, over the 5 and 10-year period is usually much greater as it's along with lower risk. At the same time during those things, we have investing -- as the business got stronger, we started investing more in SG&A and most of the businesses to drive it. And with the investments we're putting in, we get about $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion is what we said of additional sales. We have to be bringing up the SG&A in order to support those things, and it goes in before you actually get the sales results when you get through. From there going forward, in 2016, we've announced we're going to invest over $600 million. It's going in the same things of new products, increasing efficiencies and giving us more capacity in all of our different businesses. The -- again, these investments are the ones that give us the highest return at what we believe to be the lowest risk of our various opportunities. [indiscernible] Today, the fastest growing part of flooring industry is the LVT. As we just went through before, we'll have over $1 billion of capacity to support this in the U.S. and Europe. So we think we're well positioned. Our plants are more automated than others that are in there, and they're more integrated forward and backwards in order to make it at lower cost and give us high flexibility to make whatever the customer wants. With this, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities around the world. We remain disciplined in our approach to get good returns on those, and the organization's ability to identify and execute these opportunities is really what sets us apart."

At the same time, last time, we also had this $25 million of sales that were reduced between a combination of plant disruptions and negative FX, which decreased a little bit as we go through. And so we're -- so we believe the business would be better. However, the European businesses were actually stronger in the second quarter, and we think those could moderate a little, because it was so strong in the second quarter. Now I want to remind everybody that our friends in Europe in August take August off. So it's always, at a lower level and the margins drop and the sales drop as things go in Europe. We keep trying to get them to work, though, through August. We can't get them to do that yet."

The ceramic industry in Russia, my estimate is it's off about 35% from the peak. So the first thing that happened was the imports coming into Russia declined first, and they're headed close to 0 if they're not already. Now in that environment, the imports we're supplying, the mid-to high-end part of the marketplace. We are positioned in the mid- to high-end part of the marketplace, and so we became the best option to replace it. Our business, in connection with the rest of our businesses, we can make any product in Russia you can get from anywhere. So over that time, what's happened is we -- our business has been expanding in the midst of a huge recession that's going on over there. We've also been expanding the -- so we have expanded the product offering with more style and design at different price points, and we've also been expanding our distribution points. I don't know if you remember, we also have over 300 either owned or franchise retail stores that we've put through there as well as our own total national distribution system over there. In addition, because of these things, we're the only company over there that has a consumer brand. So with all this, we've been running our assets wide open at the moment. This year, we've actually increased the capacities coming on in the fall of this year, because we've run out of porcelain capacity as we speak today, and that's coming in over the next -- this period we're in right now. And then the market is really close to looking like it's bottoming soon. So it takes us about almost 1.5 years to 2 years to get new capacity in. So we've ordered -- right now in order to be able to sustain the growth after 2017, we have to have some more capacity. So that's what we've ordered and it's coming in. If the market picks up -- we know the market is going to pick up somewhere. It's really low from where it is. It's got to pickup. Our distribution has been broadened, so we're really ready ready for it. And there's a chance that we could be a little early or we could be a little late.

That solid wood product is under pressure, because as the price has gone up on the solid wood, the engineered price has gotten less.

I'm guessing that the wood -- the total wood volume, if you look at the year, we're guessing somewhere in the 3% to 4% range for the industry.

It's a very fractured business as a distribution business with a lot of small people in regional places and because we cover most of the United States, but not all of it with it. So it's an opportunity to grow our business as a broad distribution company. We've been able to leverage our relationships with ceramic and stone flooring to build a nice business that we have. And we see opportunities to expand the position into more distribution and look at the other opportunities within it. There are, for instance, in Europe, there is a porcelain countertop being made similar to ceramic tile, and we're actually putting in capacity. I mentioned earlier, they actually make it in Europe.

In the third quarter, our growth strengthened, and our margins continued to expand. Our earnings per share for the period was $3.62, a 25% increase over the prior year, or $3.50 per share excluding unusual items, an increase of 17% and an all-time record for the company. Our strategy of investing in our existing businesses as well as synergistic acquisitions continue to deliver record results. For.
The period, our operating margin, excluding unusual charges, improved 160 basis points to an all-time high of 16% as a result of higher volume and productivity. Our revenues as reported for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% on a constant-days and exchange rate basis. 
Our organization continues to create new products with greater value for the consumer. To introduce unique ideas that enhance our processes and to invest in technology and equipment that improve our cost quality and service, the 4 acquisitions we completed in 2015 contributed to our results as we enhanced our performance by upgrading their offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. As expected, excluding unusual charges, our SG&A cost as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points, as our investments in sales personnel, marketing and merchandising increased our sales and mix. 
In many of our product categories and geographies, our operations are running at or near capacity. These include all of our Global Ceramic, laminate and sheet vinyl assets. Additionally, we are currently selling all of our LVT ware [ph] manufacturing, even as we continue to increase our production capacity in the U.S. and Europe. To meet our growing customer demand, our capital investments this year will be the highest in our history as we invest almost $650 million in additional capacity, more efficient assets and new products. 
Our strong results have increased our cash flow, enabled
[Audio Gap]
The U.S. consumer spending is growing at a healthy pace through the job creation and wage growth, higher disposable income, strong consumer credit and pent-up demand to replace aging goods. The National Association of Home Builders affirmed [ph] that single-family housing demand should continue moving forward in the months ahead and that remodelers nationwide are seeing increased demand. Harvard's LIRA index likewise projects strong gains in home renovation to continue into next year, with activity stimulated by rising home values [ph] and tightening existing home inventories.
The October Architectural Billings Index pulled back slightly, although AIA expects commercial development to rebound after the presidential election. The European Central Bank remains committed to keeping interest rates at historic lows and buying bonds through at least March 2017. Although Russia remains [indiscernible] economists believe the economy -- the economic slowdown is nearing a bottom.
I'll now review our third quarter performance by segment.
Our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 4% as reported and 6% on a constant days and FX basis, with currency translation in Mexico and Russia negatively impacting our sales as reported by $5 million during the period. Operating income for the segment excluding unusual charges grew 13% over last year due to improvements in volume and productivity. 
Our North American ceramic sales trends improved from the second to the third quarter, and operating margins expanded over last year. New home construction in the commercial sector outperformed residential remodeling, and sales growth through our regional service centers outperformed other channels. The higher average selling prices of our new product introductions were partially offset by pressure on commodity products. 
We're introducing larger sizes and 3-dimensional wall tiles to extend our design leadership. We've been operating at full capacity and supplementing our domestic production with imports from our global assets and other sources. 
Our new Tennessee plant is fully operational and improving throughput. With the facility's state-of-the-art capabilities, we are developing unique styles and larger sizes that will enhance our offering. We continue to upgrade the merchandising at our service centers to broaden our customer base and drive higher sales. New paperless systems and processes in our service centers are increasing our ability to satisfy our customer and increasing our productivity. 
Sales in Mexico continue to expand faster than the market, which is up more than 10% in volume this year. We are broadening our product offering and distribution in preparation for the expansion of our Salamanca plant, which will be operational in the fall of 2017. 
We have reduced complexity of our U.S. operations as we realigned our plants by product types and increased capacity allocated to the Mexican market. This year, hundreds of projects are enhancing productivity at all our facilities, reducing the cost of our materials and improving the service and efficiencies of our logistics network. 
During the period, we successfully upgraded our ERP system with a well-executed implementation. The capabilities of our organization are improving daily, and over time, the system will enhance our performance with new functionality. 
Our European ceramic sales grew significantly in both Western and Eastern Europe from our sales and product strategies focused on local markets and preferences. In Western Europe, our investments in state-of-the-art equipment have allowed us to bring unique products to [ph] market and expand our margins and mix. Our product introductions during the last 2 [ph] years have made us a leader in wood, stone and ceramic visuals in large and small formats. We're expanding our participation in the commercial channel by increasing specifications with architects, designers and property managers. We will complete the upgrading of our high-end commercial assets by mid-2017, which will finish the entire overhaul of the Italian operations we acquired in 2013. 
We are also entering the ceramic slab business and anticipate production of countertops and large ceramic wall coverings by the end of next year. Our Eastern European ceramic business improved as we expanded capacity in Bulgaria and upgraded the style and design of our products. We are shipping products from Bulgaria to the U.S. and Western Europe to grow our business. We're in the process of transitioning our Bulgarian operations to our Italian operating system, and we expect this project to be complete in the first quarter of 2017. In Russia, the economy appears to be bottoming out, and our ceramic business there is operating at capacity. During the period, our sales improved on a local basis as we increased our participation in the new construction sector and expanded our distribution through investments in owned and franchised stores. Sales of our new product introductions have reinforced our style leadership and improved our mix and margins. Next year, we will install new capacity to enhance our offering and support additional growth when the Russian market improves.
Our Flooring North America segment improved as expected, growing 6% as reported or 7% on an adjusted days basis. Excluding unusual items, the segment's operating margin expanded to 15% from higher volume and productivity as well as lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. 
During the quarter, both our soft and hard surface flooring increased, with hard surface growing faster. Our commercial carpet and rug sales offset softer residential carpet, which was impacted by polyester growth and pressure on commodities. Our premium Karastan brand continues to grow with the expansion of our product offering and increased distribution. The SmartStrand Naturals collection we introduced this year is positioned at the high end of the market, reinforcing our leadership in the premium category. Product innovation continues to drive our business, with recent introductions comprising about 1/3 of our carpet sales during the period. 
Our commercial carpet performance continues to strengthen, with all end markets growing. We've expanded our commercial sales force and are increasing our participation in individual projects and large national accounts. We've announced a residential and commercial carpet price increase of 3% to 5% effective January to cover increased costs. A new carpet pad plant is being completed to service the Southwest region adjacent to our ceramic plant in Mexico near California. Our rug sales grew during the period as we introduced new fashion-forward collections and entered new categories with outdoor rugs and utility mats. 
Our hard surface sales of laminate wood, LVT and sheet vinyl continue to grow significantly with expanded margins. Our sales of these products are constrained by our present capacities, which are in various stages of expansion. Our participation in all channels is increasing as a result of the investments we have made in sales, marketing and innovative products. 
Improvement in our LVT production continues to increase our capacity and broaden our product offering by adding new capabilities to our LVT manufacturing plant, which will provide new product features next year. We're in the final stages of completing our new veneer [ph] wood plant, which will allow us to introduce larger sizes with [ph] unique finishes. The expansion of our laminate plant in 2017 will satisfy the increasing demand of our premium collections with superior performance and realistic visuals. 
Our manufacturing productivity across all product categories continues to positively impact our margins. Innovation in every process is driving cost and quality improvements. We're expanding our trucking fleet across the country to improve our surface and cost position.
Our Flooring Rest of the World segment performed well during the period, delivering a 15% increase in sales as reported and a 41% improvement in operating income on a constant currency basis excluding unusual items. On a legacy basis with constant days and FX, sales rose 8%. SG&A as a percent of sales continued to improve during the period. We are increasing prices based on market conditions to offset currency fluctuations. 
Our European flooring growth was led by LVT and wood, partially offset by lower sheet vinyl sales due to the disruption of production at our Belgian facility. Our laminate business continues to grow due to the strength of our Quick-Step and Pergo brands in the premium part of the market. 
We're leveraging the strong performance of our 2016 laminate introductions by expanding designs and sizes we offer. Our European and Russian laminate plants are operating near capacity, with expansions planned for Europe the end of '17 and Russia in '18. We're currently implementing process improvements to incrementally increase throughput and reduce cost. Our wood business continues to expand, and we've raised prices to offset material increases and currency changes.
Our LVT sets have been increasing dramatically, and our margins are expanding as the product mix and productivity improve. In the period, our LVT sales were limited by our capacity, which has recently been increased. By the end of the year, we will further modify our processes to expand our production even more. In the interim, we are supplementing our LVT collections with sourced products to satisfy customer demand. We've begun construction of the building for our new LVT line, which should be operational the end of next year. 
Our sheet vinyl sales during the period were lower as a result of a fire at the end of the second period. The Belgian plant is now fully operational, and we do not anticipate any long-term impact. Our insurance will cover the majority of these costs. We continue to expand our commercial sheet vinyl sales and have announced price increases to offset currency changes. 
Investments we have made to improve our costs of MDF and chipboard are increasing our margins. Our roof panel business remains steady. Sales of our insulation board continue to grow, although lower material costs and manufacturing improvements are being offset by increased competition and unfavorable exchange rates. We are revising -- realizing the anticipated synergies from the integration of our Xtratherm acquisition.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,294,000,000 and grew about 7%, both as reported and using constant exchange rates and days for our legacy business. We had 1 less day in the third quarter, and we will have 1 more day in the fourth quarter compared to last year. All segments had good growth. 
As we stated last quarter, our Q2 sales growth was lower than expected, and we anticipated that to help the Q3 growth rate. We do not expect to maintain a 7% growth rate going forward. Our gross margin as reported was 31.7%. Excluding charges, the gross margin was 32.4%, [ph] up 100 basis points versus last year, driven by growing productivity and higher volume. 
Our SG&A as reported was $348 million or 15.2% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 16.4% of sales, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. Unusual charges this quarter were a net benefit of $12 million. This is comprised of a $90 million cash receipt for a legal settlement, partially offset by a $48 million noncash charge for a trade name write-off where we've changed our commercial business -- commercial carpet business brand focus and a $30 million restructuring charge, of which approximately half is cash. 
Our operating margin excluding charges was 16% and is up 160 basis points over last year. Interest expense ended up at $9 million and decreased due to the redemption of higher-rate bonds in January of this year and the introduction of a -- our lower-rate commercial paper program. Other expense as reported was $5 million and excludes -- includes approximately $3 million of an indemnification receivable recorded last year for our IVC purchase accounting. We have an offsetting tax benefit as a related tax liability was unwound. 
Our income tax rate was 26.4% for the quarter, and that compares to 21.9% last year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to range between 23% and 24%, and our tax rate for the full year next year in 2017 to range between 26% and 27%. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.50, up 17% over last year.
We turn to the segments. In the Global Ceramics segment, sales were $822 million or up 4% as reported. They increased 6% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had very strong growth, both in Europe and in Russia in local currency, with North America growth rate improving over the second quarter. Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.6%. That's up 130 basis points over last year. Contributing to the growth over last year was productivity of $14 million, volume of $6 million and a positive price mix of $7 million, partially offset by $4 million of SG&A investment.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $1,009,000,000, up 6% or up 7% using constant days, with the hard surface categories outpacing soft service. In soft surface, both rugs and commercial carpet grew faster than residential carpet. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.3%. That's up 140 basis points, primarily from productivity of $16 million and volume of $12 million. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales as reported were $464 million or up 15% over last year. Our legacy business was up 8% using constant days and constant exchange rates. Our operating margin excluding charges was 18.4%, up 250 basis points, and it was positively impacted by productivity of $10 million and volume of $11 million plus deflation of $7 million. FX negatively impacted operating income by approximately $5 million, primarily from the British pound. We are planning to offset the sterling headwind next quarter with price increases. 
The corporate elimination segment had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect this to be about a $36 million to $38 million loss for the full year. 
Jumping to the balance sheet, receivables and did a quarter to $1,506,000,000. Our days sales outstanding were up to 56 days compared to 53 days last year due to change in the channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at $1,673,000,000. Our inventory days improved by 1 day to 104 days in the quarter. Fixed assets were $3,341,000,000 and included capital expenditures during the quarter of $184 million with depreciation and amortization of $104 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be approximately $650 million with depreciation and amortization for the full year of $410 million. 
Long-term debt was about $3 billion, and our leverage debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you."

On the ceramic business, almost all of the various pieces are at capacity. We have just finished installing a new plant in Tennessee. It's up and operating almost at the projected levels already. We have announced the increase of our plant in Mexico, which is outside Mexico City. It's going to -- we're going to double the capacity of that. That will be on the end of next year. Moving to Europe, we're placing the balance of the assets that we acquired in the high-end part that are focused more on the high-end commercial part of the business. Those should be in place some time about midyear, I believe. In addition, we are putting a new capacity going to new product category, which makes ceramics slabs, and those can be used for countertops and walls and other pieces as well as floor. We have recently increased the capacity in Bulgaria, and there won't be anymore next year. And in Russia, we're increasing our capacity next year to prepare for the Russian market to improve. Let's see if we can move around the world. In the -- I'll sort of combine some of these because they're intertwined. In the laminate business, we're using all our capacity in U.S., Europe and Russia presently. We have expansion plans for all 3. Some of the equipment is going to be off. I think it's going to take a while to get it in, and we will expand the U.S. in the fall of next year, followed by Europe and followed by Russia. It's just a matter of timing of the supplier to get the equipment in. In the wood business, we are just -- we have been putting in a new engineered wood plant, which will be starting -- which is in the middle of starting up this fall and engineered wood which is also running at capacity. The LVT businesses, we're running all the capacity we have in the U.S. and in Europe. Both of those are making incremental increases as we speak in each one and will continue to do so probably through the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of adding another production line in both Europe and the U.S., which will be working in the end of next year. And total combined, we'll have about over $1 billion of capacity in LVT as a new category. There's some other smaller things, like we just put up a new pad plant in the western United States, which will fill out our padding strategy across the United States. We have got put in new capacity to make 2 new types of rugs recently, and we're looking for alternatives everywhere. The best investments we can make are the ones that investment highest paybacks and the lowest risks. The only negative is some of them will be going to new geographies and pieces to lose money for the first year or so as you're ramping them up and getting enough volume to go through them. If I could identify twice as many, I would spend it."

In addition, in the carpet piece, there is increasing pressure from declining prices as the market growth in polyester, which sells at lower prices, has reduced the prices. And then with the overcapacity in the carpet industry, the commodity prices have gotten compressed even more. All of those things are reducing the dollar volume of the industry. At the same time, there's been the trend to selling more hard surfaces and the use of more hard services and more places, which has changed the growth rate of the entire industry, and those dynamics are continuing as they have been. So we're trying to participate in all the pieces. We're trying to make sure that we satisfy the customers in all the different product categories, and our goal is to have our business as large as we can have it and at the same time to optimize the other hard surface products, which we participate in all the parts of the business. And then going back to what we discussed before, having incremental innovation in everything is a huge benefit, and we spend a huge amount of effort trying to create some reasons that customers prefer ours in every single product category."

There's excess capacity in the marketplace. It has pushed the prices and margins down in the business for us and -- but I want to remind you at the same time that our North American flooring business is operating at historically the highest margin it's ever been at. So just what we have to deal with is the marketplace. The competition from offshore is there in different product categories. The ceramic business, there's probably almost half of the industry comes from offshore somewhere, which includes the biggest pieces coming from Mexico and China, I would guess be the 2 biggest. At the same time, the high-end sales coming out of Europe. In the other product categories, each one is different. The laminate business, there's a significant amount that used to come from China and moved to Europe. There's new capacity coming up, so it's going to move. You see the LVT with all coming out of China this new capacity coming up. It's moving to the U.S. So in these product categories where you can automate it, there's advantages to being local. But at the same time, in the world marketplace with exchange rates and other pieces, people dump excess capacity into the marketplace. We think that we're well suited to compete.

In the third quarter, our growth strengthened, and our margins continued to expand. Our earnings per share for the period was $3.62, a 25% increase over the prior year, or $3.50 per share excluding unusual items, an increase of 17% and an all-time record for the company. Our strategy of investing in our existing businesses as well as synergistic acquisitions continue to deliver record results. For the period, our operating margin, excluding unusual charges, improved 160 basis points to an all-time high of 16% as a result of higher volume and productivity. Our revenues as reported for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% on a constant-days and exchange rate basis. 
Our organization continues to create new products with greater value for the consumer. To introduce unique ideas that enhance our processes and to invest in technology and equipment that improve our cost quality and service, the 4 acquisitions we completed in 2015 contributed to our results as we enhanced our performance by upgrading their offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. As expected, excluding unusual charges, our SG&A cost as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points, as our investments in sales personnel, marketing and merchandising increased our sales and mix. 
In many of our product categories and geographies, our operations are running at or near capacity. These include all of our Global Ceramic, laminate and sheet vinyl assets. Additionally, we are currently selling all of our LVT we're manufacturing, even as we continue to increase our production capacity in the U.S. and Europe. To meet our growing customer demand, our capital investments this year will be the highest in our history as we invest almost $650 million in additional capacity, more efficient assets and new products. 
Our strong results have increased our cash flow, enabling

that the U.S. consumer spending is growing at a healthy pace through the job creation and wage growth, higher disposable income, strong consumer credit and pent-up demand to replace aging goods. The National Association of Home Builders affirmed that single-family housing demand should continue moving forward in the months ahead and that remodelers nationwide are seeing increased demand. Harvard's LIRA index likewise projects strong gains in home renovation to continue into next year, with activity stimulated by rising home values and tightening existing home inventories.
The October Architectural Billings Index pulled back slightly, although AIA expects commercial development to rebound after the presidential election. The European Central Bank remains committed to keeping interest rates at historic lows and buying bonds through at least March 2017. Although Russia remains [indiscernible] recession economists believe the economy -- the economic slowdown is nearing a bottom.
I'll now review our third quarter performance by segment.
Our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 4% as reported and 6% on a constant days and FX basis, with currency translation in Mexico and Russia negatively impacting our sales as reported by $5 million during the period. Operating income for the segment excluding unusual charges grew 13% over last year due to improvements in volume and productivity. 
Our North American ceramic sales trends improved from the second to the third quarter, and operating margins expanded over last year. New home construction in the commercial sector outperformed residential remodeling, and sales growth through our regional service centers outperformed other channels. The higher average selling prices of our new product introductions were partially offset by pressure on commodity products. 
We're introducing larger sizes and 3-dimensional wall tiles to extend our design leadership. We've been operating at full capacity and supplementing our domestic production with imports from our global assets and other sources. 
Our new Tennessee plant is fully operational and improving throughput. With the facility's state-of-the-art capabilities, we are developing unique styles and larger sizes that will enhance our offering. We continue to upgrade the merchandising at our service centers to broaden our customer base and drive higher sales. New paperless systems and processes in our service centers are increasing our ability to satisfy our customer and increasing our productivity. 
Sales in Mexico continue to expand faster than the market, which is up more than 10% in volume this year. We are broadening our product offering and distribution in preparation for the expansion of our Salamanca plant, which will be operational in the fall of 2017. 
We have reduced complexity of our U.S. operations as we realigned our plants by product types and increased capacity allocated to the Mexican market. This year, hundreds of projects are enhancing productivity at all our facilities, reducing the cost of our materials and improving the service and efficiencies of our logistics network. 
During the period, we successfully upgraded our ERP system with a well-executed implementation. The capabilities of our organization are improving daily, and over time, the system will enhance our performance with new functionality. 
Our European ceramic sales grew significantly in both Western and Eastern Europe from our sales and product strategies focused on local markets and preferences. In Western Europe, our investments in state-of-the-art equipment have allowed us to bring unique products to market and expand our margins and mix. Our product introductions during the last 2 years have made us a leader in wood, stone and ceramic visuals in large and small formats. We're expanding our participation in the commercial channel by increasing specifications with architects, designers and property managers. We will complete the upgrading of our high-end commercial assets by mid-2017, which will finish the entire overhaul of the Italian operations we acquired in 2013. 
We are also entering the ceramic slab business and anticipate production of countertops and large ceramic wall coverings by the end of next year. Our Eastern European ceramic business improved as we expanded capacity in Bulgaria and upgraded the style and design of our products. We are shipping products from Bulgaria to the U.S. and Western Europe to grow our business. We're in the process of transitioning our Bulgarian operations to our Italian operating system, and we expect this project to be complete in the first quarter of 2017. In Russia, the economy appears to be bottoming out, and our ceramic business there is operating at capacity. During the period, our sales improved on a local basis as we increased our participation in the new construction sector and expanded our distribution through investments in owned and franchised stores. Sales of our new product introductions have reinforced our style leadership and improved our mix and margins. Next year, we will install new capacity to enhance our offering and support additional growth when the Russian market improves.
Our Flooring North America segment improved as expected, growing 6% as reported or 7% on an adjusted days basis. Excluding unusual items, the segment's operating margin expanded to 15% from higher volume and productivity as well as lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. 
During the quarter, both our soft and hard surface flooring increased, with hard surface growing faster. Our commercial carpet and rug sales offset softer residential carpet, which was impacted by polyester growth and pressure on commodities. Our premium Karastan brand continues to grow with the expansion of our product offering and increased distribution. The SmartStrand Naturals collection we introduced this year is positioned at the high end of the market, reinforcing our leadership in the premium category. Product innovation continues to drive our business, with recent introductions comprising about 1/3 of our carpet sales during the period. 
Our commercial carpet performance continues to strengthen, with all end markets growing. We've expanded our commercial sales force and are increasing our participation in individual projects and large national accounts. We've announced a residential and commercial carpet price increase of 3% to 5% effective January to cover increased costs. A new carpet pad plant is being completed to service the Southwest region adjacent to our ceramic plant in Mexico near California. Our rug sales grew during the period as we introduced new fashion-forward collections and entered new categories with outdoor rugs and utility mats. 
Our hard surface sales of laminate wood, LVT and sheet vinyl continue to grow significantly with expanded margins. Our sales of these products are constrained by our present capacities, which are in various stages of expansion. Our participation in all channels is increasing as a result of the investments we have made in sales, marketing and innovative products. 
Improvement in our LVT production continues to increase our capacity and broaden our product offering by adding new capabilities to our LVT manufacturing plant, which will provide new product features next year. We're in the final stages of completing our new engineered [ph] wood plant, which will allow us to introduce larger sizes with unique finishes. The expansion of our laminate plant in 2017 will satisfy the increasing demand of our premium collections with superior performance and realistic visuals. 
Our manufacturing productivity across all product categories continues to positively impact our margins. Innovation in every process is driving cost and quality improvements. We're expanding our trucking fleet across the country to improve our surface and cost position.
Our Flooring Rest of the World segment performed well during the period, delivering a 15% increase in sales as reported and a 41% improvement in operating income on a constant currency basis excluding unusual items. On a legacy basis with constant days and FX, sales rose 8%. SG&A as a percent of sales continued to improve during the period. We are increasing prices based on market conditions to offset currency fluctuations. 
Our European flooring growth was led by LVT and wood, partially offset by lower sheet vinyl sales due to the disruption of production at our Belgian facility. Our laminate business continues to grow due to the strength of our Quick-Step and Pergo brands in the premium part of the market. 
We're leveraging the strong performance of our 2016 laminate introductions by expanding designs and sizes we offer. Our European and Russian laminate plants are operating near capacity, with expansions planned for Europe the end of '17 and Russia in '18. We're currently implementing process improvements to incrementally increase throughput and reduce cost. Our wood business continues to expand, and we've raised prices to offset material increases and currency changes.
Our LVT sets have been increasing dramatically, and our margins are expanding as the product mix and productivity improve. In the period, our LVT sales were limited by our capacity, which has recently been increased. By the end of the year, we will further modify our processes to expand our production even more. In the interim, we are supplementing our LVT collections with sourced products to satisfy customer demand. We've begun construction of the building for our new LVT line, which should be operational the end of next year. 
Our sheet vinyl sales during the period were lower as a result of a fire at the end of the second period. The Belgian plant is now fully operational, and we do not anticipate any long-term impact. Our insurance will cover the majority of these costs. We continue to expand our commercial sheet vinyl sales and have announced price increases to offset currency changes. 
Investments we have made to improve our costs of MDF and chipboard are increasing our margins. Our roof panel business remains steady. Sales of our insulation board continue to grow, although lower material costs and manufacturing improvements are being offset by increased competition and unfavorable exchange rates. We are revising -- realizing the anticipated synergies from the integration of our Xtratherm acquisition.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,294,000,000 and grew about 7%, both as reported and using constant exchange rates and days for our legacy business. We had 1 less day in the third quarter, and we will have 1 more day in the fourth quarter compared to last year. All segments had good growth. 
As we stated last quarter, our Q2 sales growth was lower than expected, and we anticipated that to help the Q3 growth rate. We do not expect to maintain a 7% growth rate going forward. Our gross margin as reported was 31.7%. Excluding charges, the gross margin was 32.4%, up 100 basis points versus last year, driven by growing productivity and higher volume. 
Our SG&A as reported was $348 million or 15.2% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 16.4% of sales, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. Unusual charges this quarter were a net benefit of $12 million. This is comprised of a $90 million cash receipt for a legal settlement, partially offset by a $48 million noncash charge for a trade name write-off where we've changed our commercial business -- commercial carpet business brand focus and a $30 million restructuring charge, of which approximately half is cash. 
Our operating margin excluding charges was 16% and is up 160 basis points over last year. Interest expense ended up at $9 million and decreased due to the redemption of higher-rate bonds in January of this year and the introduction of a -- our lower-rate commercial paper program. Other expense as reported was $5 million and excludes -- includes approximately $3 million of an indemnification receivable recorded last year for our IVC purchase accounting. We have an offsetting tax benefit as a related tax liability was unwound. 
Our income tax rate was 26.4% for the quarter, and that compares to 21.9% last year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to range between 23% and 24%, and our tax rate for the full year next year in 2017 to range between 26% and 27%. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.50, up 17% over last year.
We turn to the segments. In the Global Ceramics segment, sales were $822 million or up 4% as reported. They increased 6% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had very strong growth, both in Europe and in Russia in local currency, with North America growth rate improving over the second quarter. Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.6%. That's up 130 basis points over last year. Contributing to the growth over last year was productivity of $14 million, volume of $6 million and a positive price mix of $7 million, partially offset by $4 million of SG&A investment.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $1,009,000,000, up 6% or up 7% using constant days, with the hard surface categories outpacing soft service. In soft surface, both rugs and commercial carpet grew faster than residential carpet. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.3%. That's up 140 basis points, primarily from productivity of $16 million and volume of $12 million. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales as reported were $464 million or up 15% over last year. Our legacy business was up 8% using constant days and constant exchange rates. Our operating margin excluding charges was 18.4%, up 250 basis points, and it was positively impacted by productivity of $10 million and volume of $11 million plus deflation of $7 million. FX negatively impacted operating income by approximately $5 million, primarily from the British pound. We are planning to offset the sterling headwind next quarter with price increases. 
The corporate and eliminations segment had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect this to be about a $36 million to $38 million loss for the full year. 
Jumping to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1,506,000,000. Our days sales outstanding were up to 56 days compared to 53 days last year due to change in the channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at $1,673,000,000. Our inventory days improved by 1 day to 104 days in the quarter. Fixed assets were $3,341,000,000 and included capital expenditures during the quarter of $184 million, with depreciation and amortization of $104 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be approximately $650 million, with depreciation and amortization for the full year of $410 million. 
Long-term debt was about $3 billion, and our leverage debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x.

We have announced the increase of our plant in Mexico, which is outside Mexico City. It's going to -- we're going to double the capacity of -- That'll be on the end of next year. That's it. Moving to Europe, we're replacing the balance of the assets that we acquired in the high-end part -- that are focused more on the high-end commercial part of the business. Those should be in place sometime about midyear, I believe. In addition, we're putting in new capacity to go in the new product category, which makes ceramic slabs, and those can be used for countertops and walls and other pieces as well as floor. We have recently increased the capacity in Bulgaria, and there won't be any more next year. And in Russia, we're increasing our capacity next year to prepare for the Russian market to improve. Let's see if we can move around the world. In the -- I'll sort of combine some of these, because they're intertwined. In the laminate business, we're using all our capacity in the U.S., Europe and Russia presently. We have expansion plans for all 3. Some of the equipment's going to be off. I think it's going to take a while to get it in. We will expand the U.S. in the fall of next year, followed by Europe and followed by Russia, and it's just a matter of timing of the supplier to get the equipment in. In the wood business, we are just -- we have been putting in a new engineered wood plant, which will be starting -- which is in the middle of starting up this fall in engineered wood, which is also running at capacity. The LVT businesses, we're running all the capacity we have in the U.S. and in Europe. Both of those are making incremental increases, as we speak, in each one, and that'll continue to do so probably through the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of adding another production line in both Europe and the U.S., which will be working in the end of next year. And total combined, we'll have about 100 -- over $1 billion of capacity in LVT as a new category. There are some other smaller things, like we just put up a new pad plant in the Western United States, which will fill out our padding strategy across the United States. We have got -- put in new capacity to make 2 new types of rugs recently, and we're looking for alternatives everywhere. The best investments we can make are the ones in internal investment that have the highest paybacks and the lowest risks. The only negative is some of them that would be go onto new geographies and pieces, they tend to lose money for the first year or so as you're ramping them up and getting enough volume to go through them.

And then, at the same time, offsetting that, when you're near capacity limitations, the working capital becomes lower, and then more important is creating more product. So in some cases, we're giving up turns in order to try to get more throughput out of the business in the short term."

Residential replacement has not had the same robustness we would've expected going through the cycle, and it's in all the product categories as you go through. In addition, in the carpet piece, there is increasing pressure from declining prices as the market growth in polyester, which sells at lower prices, has reduced the prices. And then with the overcapacities in the carpet industry, the commodity prices have gotten compressed even more. All of those things are reducing the dollar volume of the industry. At the same time, there's been the trend to selling more hard surfaces and the use of more hard surfaces in more places, which has changed the growth rate of the entire industry, and those dynamics are continuing as they have been. As if -- so we're trying to participate in all the pieces. We're trying to make sure that we satisfy the customers in all the different product categories, and our goal is to have our carpet business as large as we can have it, and at the same time, to optimize the other hard surface products, which we participate in all the parts of the business.

What -- at the same time, the high-end sales coming out of Europe. That's it [ph]. In the other product categories, each one is different. The laminate business, there's a significant amount that used to come from China, moved to Europe. And there's new capacity coming up, so it's going to move here. You see the LVT with all coming out of China, there's new capacity coming up. It's moving to the U.S. So as -- in these product categories where you can automate it, there's advantages to being local. But at the same time, if -- in the world marketplace, with exchange rates and other pieces, people dump excess capacity into the marketplace. We think that we're well suited to compete. And in the ceramic industry -- and we're actually built -- we own different capacity everywhere. We started this year.

In the third quarter, our growth strengthened, and our margins continued to expand. Our earnings per share for the period was $3.62, a 25% increase over the prior year, or $3.50 per share excluding unusual items, an increase of 17% and an all-time record for the company. Our strategy of investing in our existing businesses as well as synergistic acquisitions continue to deliver record results. For the period, our operating margin, excluding unusual charges, improved 160 basis points to an all-time high of 16% as a result of higher volume and productivity. Our revenues as reported for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% on a constant-days and exchange rate basis. 
Our organization continues to create new products with greater value for the consumer. To introduce unique ideas that enhance our processes and to invest in technology and equipment that improve our cost quality and service, the 4 acquisitions we completed in 2015 contributed to our results as we enhanced our performance by upgrading their offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. As expected, excluding unusual charges, our SG&A cost as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points, as our investments in sales personnel, marketing and merchandising increased our sales and mix. 
In many of our product categories and geographies, our operations are running at or near capacity. These include all of our Global Ceramic, laminate and sheet vinyl assets. Additionally, we are currently selling all of our LVT we're manufacturing, even as we continue to increase our production capacity in the U.S. and Europe. To meet our growing customer demand, our capital investments this year will be the highest in our history as we invest almost $650 million in additional capacity, more efficient assets and new products. 
Our strong results have increased our cash flow, enabling

that the U.S. consumer spending is growing at a healthy pace through the job creation and wage growth, higher disposable income, strong consumer credit and pent-up demand to replace aging goods. The National Association of Home Builders affirmed that single-family housing demand should continue moving forward in the months ahead and that remodelers nationwide are seeing increased demand. Harvard's LIRA index likewise projects strong gains in home renovation to continue into next year, with activity stimulated by rising home values and tightening existing home inventories.
The October Architectural Billings Index pulled back slightly, although AIA expects commercial development to rebound after the presidential election. The European Central Bank remains committed to keeping interest rates at historic lows and buying bonds through at least March 2017. Although Russia remains [indiscernible] recession economists believe the economy -- the economic slowdown is nearing a bottom.
I'll now review our third quarter performance by segment.
Our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 4% as reported and 6% on a constant days and FX basis, with currency translation in Mexico and Russia negatively impacting our sales as reported by $5 million during the period. Operating income for the segment excluding unusual charges grew 13% over last year due to improvements in volume and productivity. 
Our North American ceramic sales trends improved from the second to the third quarter, and operating margins expanded over last year. New home construction in the commercial sector outperformed residential remodeling, and sales growth through our regional service centers outperformed other channels. The higher average selling prices of our new product introductions were partially offset by pressure on commodity products. 
We're introducing larger sizes and 3-dimensional wall tiles to extend our design leadership. We've been operating at full capacity and supplementing our domestic production with imports from our global assets and other sources. 
Our new Tennessee plant is fully operational and improving throughput. With the facility's state-of-the-art capabilities, we are developing unique styles and larger sizes that will enhance our offering. We continue to upgrade the merchandising at our service centers to broaden our customer base and drive higher sales. New paperless systems and processes in our service centers are increasing our ability to satisfy our customer and increasing our productivity. 
Sales in Mexico continue to expand faster than the market, which is up more than 10% in volume this year. We are broadening our product offering and distribution in preparation for the expansion of our Salamanca plant, which will be operational in the Fall of 2017. 
We have reduced complexity of our U.S. operations as we realigned our plants by product types and increased capacity allocated to the Mexican market. This year, hundreds of projects are enhancing productivity at all our facilities, reducing the cost of our materials and improving the service and efficiencies of our logistics network. 
During the period, we successfully upgraded our ERP system with a well-executed implementation. The capabilities of our organization are improving daily, and over time, the system will enhance our performance with new functionality. 
Our European ceramic sales grew significantly in both Western and Eastern Europe from our sales and product strategies focused on local markets and preferences. In Western Europe, our investments in state-of-the-art equipment have allowed us to bring unique products to market and expand our margins and mix. Our product introductions during the last 2 years have made us a leader in wood, stone and ceramic visuals in large and small formats. We're expanding our participation in the commercial channel by increasing specifications with architects, designers and property managers. We will complete the upgrading of our high-end commercial assets by mid-2017, which will finish the entire overhaul of the Italian operations we acquired in 2013. 
We are also entering the ceramic slab business and anticipate production of countertops and large ceramic wall coverings by the end of next year. Our Eastern European ceramic business improved as we expanded capacity in Bulgaria and upgraded the style and design of our products. We are shipping products from Bulgaria to the U.S. and Western Europe to grow our business. We're in the process of transitioning our Bulgarian operations to our Italian operating system, and we expect this project to be complete in the first quarter of 2017. In Russia, the economy appears to be bottoming out, and our ceramic business there is operating at capacity. During the period, our sales improved on a local basis as we increased our participation in the new construction sector and expanded our distribution through investments in owned and franchised stores. Sales of our new product introductions have reinforced our style leadership and improved our mix and margins. Next year, we will install new capacity to enhance our offering and support additional growth when the Russian market improves.
Our Flooring North America segment improved as expected, growing 6% as reported or 7% on an adjusted days basis. Excluding unusual items, the segment's operating margin expanded to 15% from higher volume and productivity as well as lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. 
During the quarter, both our soft and hard surface flooring increased, with hard surface growing faster. Our commercial carpet and rug sales offset softer residential carpet, which was impacted by polyester growth and pressure on commodities. Our premium Karastan brand continues to grow with the expansion of our product offering and increased distribution. The SmartStrand Naturals collection we introduced this year is positioned at the high end of the market, reinforcing our leadership in the premium category. Product innovation continues to drive our business, with recent introductions comprising about 1/3 of our carpet sales during the period. 
Our commercial carpet performance continues to strengthen, with all end markets growing. We've expanded our commercial sales force and are increasing our participation in individual projects and large national accounts. We've announced a residential and commercial carpet price increase of 3% to 5% effective January to cover increased costs. A new carpet pad plant is being completed to service the Southwest region adjacent to our ceramic plant in Mexico near California. Our rug sales grew during the period as we introduced new fashion-forward collections and entered new categories with outdoor rugs and utility mats. 
Our hard surface sales of laminate wood, LVT and sheet vinyl continue to grow significantly with expanded margins. Our sales of these products are constrained by our present capacities, which are in various stages of expansion. Our participation in all channels is increasing as a result of the investments we have made in sales, marketing and innovative products. 
Improvement in our LVT production continues to increase our capacity and broaden our product offering by adding new capabilities to our LVT manufacturing plant, which will provide new product features next year. We're in the final stages of completing our new engineered wood plant, which will allow us to introduce larger sizes with unique finishes. The expansion of our laminate plant in 2017 will satisfy the increasing demand for our premium collections with superior performance and realistic visuals. 
Our manufacturing productivity across all product categories continues to positively impact our margins. Innovation in every process is driving cost and quality improvements. We're expanding our trucking fleet across the country to improve our surface and cost position.
Our Flooring Rest of the World segment performed well during the period, delivering a 15% increase in sales as reported and a 41% improvement in operating income on a constant currency basis excluding unusual items. On a legacy basis with constant days and FX, sales rose 8%. SG&A as a percent of sales continued to improve during the period. We are increasing prices based on market conditions to offset currency fluctuations. 
Our European flooring growth was led by LVT and wood, partially offset by lower sheet vinyl sales due to the disruption of production at our Belgian facility. Our laminate business continues to grow due to the strength of our Quick-Step and Pergo brands in the premium part of the market. 
We're leveraging the strong performance of our 2016 laminate introductions by expanding designs and sizes we offer. Our European and Russian laminate plants are operating near capacity, with expansions planned for Europe the end of '17 and Russia in '18. We're currently implementing process improvements to incrementally increase throughput and reduce cost. Our wood business continues to expand, and we've raised prices to offset material increases and currency changes.
Our LVT sets have been increasing dramatically, and our margins are expanding as the product mix and productivity improve. In the period, our LVT sales were limited by our capacity, which has recently been increased. By the end of the year, we will further modify our processes to expand our production even more. In the interim, we are supplementing our LVT collections with sourced products to satisfy customer demand. We've begun construction of the building for our new LVT line, which should be operational the end of next year. 
Our sheet vinyl sales during the period were lower as a result of a fire at the end of the second period. The Belgian plant is now fully operational, and we do not anticipate any long-term impact. Our insurance will cover the majority of these costs. We continue to expand our commercial sheet vinyl sales and have announced price increases to offset currency changes. 
Investments we have made to improve our costs of MDF and chipboard are increasing our margins. Our roof panel business remains steady. Sales of our insulation board continue to grow, although lower material costs and manufacturing improvements are being offset by increased competition and unfavorable exchange rates. We are realizing the anticipated synergies from the integration of our Xtratherm acquisition.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,294,000,000 and grew about 7%, both as reported and using constant exchange rates and days for our legacy business. We had one less day in the third quarter, and we will have one more day in the fourth quarter compared to last year. All segments had good growth. 
As we stated last quarter, our Q2 sales growth was lower than expected, and we anticipated that to help the Q3 growth rate. We do not expect to maintain a 7% growth rate going forward. Our gross margin as reported was 31.7%. Excluding charges, the gross margin was 32.4%, up 100 basis points versus last year, driven by growing productivity and higher volume. 
Our SG&A as reported was $348 million or 15.2% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 16.4% of sales, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. Unusual charges this quarter were a net benefit of $12 million. This is comprised of a $90 million cash receipt for a legal settlement, partially offset by a $48 million noncash charge for a trade name write-off where we've changed our commercial business -- commercial carpet business brand focus and a $30 million restructuring charge, of which approximately half is cash. 
Our operating margin excluding charges was 16% and is up 160 basis points over last year. Interest expense ended up at $9 million and decreased due to the redemption of higher-rate bonds in January of this year and the introduction of a -- our lower-rate commercial paper program. Other expense as reported was $5 million and excludes -- includes approximately $3 million of an indemnification receivable recorded last year for our IVC purchase accounting. We have an offsetting tax benefit as a related tax liability was unwound. 
Our income tax rate was 26.4% for the quarter, and that compares to 21.9% last year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to range between 23% and 24%, and our tax rate for the full year next year in 2017 to range between 26% and 27%. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.50, up 17% over last year.
We turn to the segments. In the Global Ceramics segment, sales were $822 million or up 4% as reported. They increased 6% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had very strong growth, both in Europe and in Russia in local currency, with North America growth rate improving over the second quarter. Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.6%. That's up 130 basis points over last year. Contributing to the growth over last year was productivity of $14 million, volume of $6 million and a positive price mix of $7 million, partially offset by $4 million of SG&A investment.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $1,009,000,000, up 6% or up 7% using constant days, with the hard surface categories outpacing soft surface. In soft surface, both rugs and commercial carpet grew faster than residential carpet. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.3%. That's up 140 basis points, primarily from productivity of $16 million and volume of $12 million. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales as reported were $464 million or up 15% over last year. Our legacy business was up 8% using constant days and constant exchange rates. Our operating margin excluding charges was 18.4%, up 250 basis points, and it was positively impacted by productivity of $10 million and volume of $11 million plus deflation of $7 million. FX negatively impacted operating income by approximately $5 million, primarily from the British pound. We are planning to offset the sterling headwind next quarter with price increases. 
The corporate and eliminations segment had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect this to be about a $36 million to $38 million loss for the full year. 
Jumping to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1,506,000,000. Our days sales outstanding were up to 56 days compared to 53 days last year due to change in the channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at $1,673,000,000. Our inventory days improved by 1 day to 104 days in the quarter. Fixed assets were $3,341,000,000 and included capital expenditures during the quarter of $184 million, with depreciation and amortization of $104 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be approximately $650 million, with depreciation and amortization for the full year of $410 million. 
Long-term debt was about $3 billion, and our leverage debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x.

We have announced the increase of our plant in Mexico, which is outside Mexico City. It's going to -- we're going to double the capacity of -- that'll be on the end of next year. That's it. Moving to Europe, we're replacing the balance of the assets that we acquired in the high-end part -- that are focused more on the high-end commercial part of the business, those should be in place sometime about midyear, I believe. In addition, we're putting in new capacity to go in the new product category, which makes ceramic slabs, and those can be used for countertops and walls and other pieces as well as floor. We have recently increased the capacity in Bulgaria, and there won't be any more next year. And in Russia, we're increasing our capacity next year to prepare for the Russian market to improve. Let's see if we can move around the world. In the -- I'll sort of combine some of these, because they're intertwined. In the laminate business, we're using all our capacity in the U.S., Europe and Russia presently. We have expansion plans for all 3. Some of the equipment's going to be off. I think it's going to take a while to get it in. We will expand the U.S. in the fall of next year, followed by Europe and followed by Russia, and it's just a matter of timing of the supplier to get the equipment in. In the wood business, we are just -- we have been putting in a new engineered wood plant, which will be starting -- which is in the middle of starting up this fall in engineered wood, which is also running at capacity. The LVT businesses, we're running all the capacity we have in the U.S. and in Europe. Both of those are making incremental increases, as we speak, in each one, and that'll continue to do so probably through the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of adding another production line in both Europe and the U.S., which will be working in the end of next year. And total combined, we'll have about 100 -- over $1 billion of capacity in LVT as a new category. There are some other smaller things, like we just put up a new pad plant in the Western United States, which will fill out our padding strategy across the United States. We have got -- put in new capacity to make 2 new types of rugs recently, and we're looking for alternatives everywhere. The best investments we can make are the ones in internal investment that have the highest paybacks and the lowest risks. The only negative is some of them that would go onto new geographies in pieces, they tend to lose money for the first year or so as you're ramping them up and getting enough volume to go through them. If I could identify twice as many, I would spend it."

So we're starting in Europe, where the market's already starting accepting it, and we'll be shipping product from there to the U.S. And over time, if it makes sense, we will put in more capacity in the United States. Now all that's different than the quartz business, which we also sell through our distribution."

Residential replacement has not had the same robustness we would've expected going through the cycle, and it's in all the product categories as you go through. In addition, in the carpet piece, there is increasing pressure from declining prices as the market growth in polyester, which sells at lower prices, has reduced the prices. And then with the overcapacities in the carpet industry, the commodity prices have gotten compressed even more. All of those things are reducing the dollar volume of the industry. At the same time, there's been the trend to selling more hard surfaces and the use of more hard surfaces in more places, which has changed the growth rate of the entire industry, and those dynamics are continuing as they have been. As if -- so we're trying to participate in all the pieces. We're trying to make sure that we satisfy the customers in all the different product categories, and our goal is to have our carpet business as large as we can have it, and at the same time, to optimize the other hard surface products, which we participate in all the parts of the business.

So it's just what we have to deal with -- the marketplace. The competition from offshore is there in the different -- in different product categories. The ceramic business, there's probably almost half of the industry comes from offshore somewhere, which includes the biggest pieces coming from Mexico and China, I would guess, would be the 2 biggest. What -- at the same time, the high-end stuff's coming out of Europe -- is it. In the other product categories, each one is different. The laminate business, there's a significant amount that used to come from China, moved to Europe. And there's new capacity coming up, so it's going to move here. You see the LVT with all coming out of China, there's new capacity coming up. It's moving to the U.S. So as -- in these product categories where you can automate it, there's advantages to being local. But at the same time, if -- in the world marketplace, with exchange rates and other pieces, people dump excess capacity into the marketplace. We think that we're well suited to compete. And in the ceramic industry -- and we're actually built -- we own different capacity everywhere. We started this year.

In the third quarter, our growth strengthened, and our margins continued to expand. Our earnings per share for the period was $3.62, a 25% increase over the prior year, or $3.50 per share excluding unusual items, an increase of 17% and an all-time record for the company. Our strategy of investing in our existing businesses as well as synergistic acquisitions continue to deliver record results. For the period, our operating margin, excluding unusual charges, improved 160 basis points to an all-time high of 16% as a result of higher volume and productivity. Our revenues as reported for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% on a constant-days and exchange rate basis. 
Our organization continues to create new products with greater value for the consumer. To introduce unique ideas that enhance our processes and to invest in technology and equipment that improve our cost quality and service, the 4 acquisitions we completed in 2015 contributed to our results as we enhanced our performance by upgrading their offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. As expected, excluding unusual charges, our SG&A cost as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points, as our investments in sales personnel, marketing and merchandising increased our sales and mix. 
In many of our product categories and geographies, our operations are running at or near capacity. These include all of our Global Ceramic, laminate and sheet vinyl assets. Additionally, we are currently selling all of our LVT we're manufacturing, even as we continue to increase our production capacity in the U.S. and Europe. To meet our growing customer demand, our capital investments this year will be the highest in our history as we invest almost $650 million in additional capacity, more efficient assets and new products. 
Our strong results have increased our cash flow, enabling

that the U.S. consumer spending is growing at a healthy pace through the job creation and wage growth, higher disposable income, strong consumer credit and pent-up demand to replace aging goods. The National Association of Home Builders affirmed that single-family housing demand should continue moving forward in the months ahead and that remodelers nationwide are seeing increased demand. Harvard's LIRA index likewise projects strong gains in home renovation to continue into next year, with activity stimulated by rising home values and tightening existing home inventories.
The October Architectural Billings Index pulled back slightly, although AIA expects commercial development to rebound after the presidential election. The European Central Bank remains committed to keeping interest rates at historic lows and buying bonds through at least March 2017. Although Russia remains [indiscernible] recession economists believe the economy -- the economic slowdown is nearing a bottom.
I'll now review our third quarter performance by segment.
Our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 4% as reported and 6% on a constant days and FX basis, with currency translation in Mexico and Russia negatively impacting our sales as reported by $5 million during the period. Operating income for the segment excluding unusual charges grew 13% over last year due to improvements in volume and productivity. 
Our North American ceramic sales trends improved from the second to the third quarter, and operating margins expanded over last year. New home construction in the commercial sector outperformed residential remodeling, and sales growth through our regional service centers outperformed other channels. The higher average selling prices of our new product introductions were partially offset by pressure on commodity products. 
We're introducing larger sizes and 3-dimensional wall tiles to extend our design leadership. We've been operating at full capacity and supplementing our domestic production with imports from our global assets and other sources. 
Our new Tennessee plant is fully operational and improving throughput. With the facility's state-of-the-art capabilities, we are developing unique styles and larger sizes that will enhance our offering. We continue to upgrade the merchandising at our service centers to broaden our customer base and drive higher sales. New paperless systems and processes in our service centers are increasing our ability to satisfy our customer and increasing our productivity. 
Sales in Mexico continue to expand faster than the market, which is up more than 10% in volume this year. We are broadening our product offering and distribution in preparation for the expansion of our Salamanca plant, which will be operational in the Fall of 2017. 
We have reduced complexity of our U.S. operations as we realigned our plants by product types and increased capacity allocated to the Mexican market. This year, hundreds of projects are enhancing productivity at all our facilities, reducing the cost of our materials and improving the service and efficiencies of our logistics network. 
During the period, we successfully upgraded our ERP system with a well-executed implementation. The capabilities of our organization are improving daily, and over time, the system will enhance our performance with new functionality. 
Our European ceramic sales grew significantly in both Western and Eastern Europe from our sales and product strategies focused on local markets and preferences. In Western Europe, our investments in state-of-the-art equipment have allowed us to bring unique products to market and expand our margins and mix. Our product introductions during the last 2 years have made us a leader in wood, stone and ceramic visuals in large and small formats. We're expanding our participation in the commercial channel by increasing specifications with architects, designers and property managers. We will complete the upgrading of our high-end commercial assets by mid-2017, which will finish the entire overhaul of the Italian operations we acquired in 2013. 
We are also entering the ceramic slab business and anticipate production of countertops and large ceramic wall coverings by the end of next year. Our Eastern European ceramic business improved as we expanded capacity in Bulgaria and upgraded the style and design of our products. We are shipping products from Bulgaria to the U.S. and Western Europe to grow our business. We're in the process of transitioning our Bulgarian operations to our Italian operating system, and we expect this project to be complete in the first quarter of 2017. In Russia, the economy appears to be bottoming out, and our ceramic business there is operating at capacity. During the period, our sales improved on a local basis as we increased our participation in the new construction sector and expanded our distribution through investments in owned and franchised stores. Sales of our new product introductions have reinforced our style leadership and improved our mix and margins. Next year, we will install new capacity to enhance our offering and support additional growth when the Russian market improves.
Our Flooring North America segment improved as expected, growing 6% as reported or 7% on an adjusted days basis. Excluding unusual items, the segment's operating margin expanded to 15% from higher volume and productivity as well as lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. 
During the quarter, both our soft and hard surface flooring increased, with hard surface growing faster. Our commercial carpet and rug sales offset softer residential carpet, which was impacted by polyester growth and pressure on commodities. Our premium Karastan brand continues to grow with the expansion of our product offering and increased distribution. The SmartStrand Naturals collection we introduced this year is positioned at the high end of the market, reinforcing our leadership in the premium category. Product innovation continues to drive our business, with recent introductions comprising about 1/3 of our carpet sales during the period. 
Our commercial carpet performance continues to strengthen, with all end markets growing. We've expanded our commercial sales force and are increasing our participation in individual projects and large national accounts. We've announced a residential and commercial carpet price increase of 3% to 5% effective January to cover increased costs. A new carpet pad plant is being completed to service the Southwest region adjacent to our ceramic plant in Mexico near California. Our rug sales grew during the period as we introduced new fashion-forward collections and entered new categories with outdoor rugs and utility mats. 
Our hard surface sales of laminate wood, LVT and sheet vinyl continue to grow significantly with expanded margins. Our sales of these products are constrained by our present capacities, which are in various stages of expansion. Our participation in all channels is increasing as a result of the investments we have made in sales, marketing and innovative products. 
Improvement in our LVT production continues to increase our capacity and broaden our product offering by adding new capabilities to our LVT manufacturing plant, which will provide new product features next year. We're in the final stages of completing our new engineered wood plant, which will allow us to introduce larger sizes with unique finishes. The expansion of our laminate plant in 2017 will satisfy the increasing demand for our premium collections with superior performance and realistic visuals. 
Our manufacturing productivity across all product categories continues to positively impact our margins. Innovation in every process is driving cost and quality improvements. We're expanding our trucking fleet across the country to improve our surface and cost position.
Our Flooring Rest of the World segment performed well during the period, delivering a 15% increase in sales as reported and a 41% improvement in operating income on a constant currency basis excluding unusual items. On a legacy basis with constant days and FX, sales rose 8%. SG&A as a percent of sales continued to improve during the period. We are increasing prices based on market conditions to offset currency fluctuations. 
Our European flooring growth was led by LVT and wood, partially offset by lower sheet vinyl sales due to the disruption of production at our Belgian facility. Our laminate business continues to grow due to the strength of our Quick-Step and Pergo brands in the premium part of the market. 
We're leveraging the strong performance of our 2016 laminate introductions by expanding designs and sizes we offer. Our European and Russian laminate plants are operating near capacity, with expansions planned for Europe the end of '17 and Russia in '18. We're currently implementing process improvements to incrementally increase throughput and reduce cost. Our wood business continues to expand, and we've raised prices to offset material increases and currency changes.
Our LVT sets have been increasing dramatically, and our margins are expanding as the product mix and productivity improve. In the period, our LVT sales were limited by our capacity, which has recently been increased. By the end of the year, we will further modify our processes to expand our production even more. In the interim, we are supplementing our LVT collections with sourced products to satisfy customer demand. We've begun construction of the building for our new LVT line, which should be operational the end of next year. 
Our sheet vinyl sales during the period were lower as a result of a fire at the end of the second period. The Belgian plant is now fully operational, and we do not anticipate any long-term impact. Our insurance will cover the majority of these costs. We continue to expand our commercial sheet vinyl sales and have announced price increases to offset currency changes. 
Investments we have made to improve our costs of MDF and chipboard are increasing our margins. Our roof panel business remains steady. Sales of our insulation board continue to grow, although lower material costs and manufacturing improvements are being offset by increased competition and unfavorable exchange rates. We are realizing the anticipated synergies from the integration of our Xtratherm acquisition.
I'll now turn the call over to Frank to review our financial performance for the period."

Net sales for the quarter were $2,294,000,000 and grew about 7%, both as reported and using constant exchange rates and days for our legacy business. We had one less day in the third quarter, and we will have one more day in the fourth quarter compared to last year. All segments had good growth. 
As we stated last quarter, our Q2 sales growth was lower than expected, and we anticipated that to help the Q3 growth rate. We do not expect to maintain a 7% growth rate going forward. Our gross margin as reported was 31.7%. Excluding charges, the gross margin was 32.4%, up 100 basis points versus last year, driven by growing productivity and higher volume. 
Our SG&A as reported was $348 million or 15.2% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A was 16.4% of sales, a 60 basis point improvement over last year. Unusual charges this quarter were a net benefit of $12 million. This is comprised of a $90 million cash receipt for a legal settlement, partially offset by a $48 million noncash charge for a trade name write-off where we've changed our commercial business -- commercial carpet business brand focus and a $30 million restructuring charge, of which approximately half is cash. 
Our operating margin excluding charges was 16% and is up 160 basis points over last year. Interest expense ended up at $9 million and decreased due to the redemption of higher-rate bonds in January of this year and the introduction of a -- our lower-rate commercial paper program. Other expense as reported was $5 million and excludes -- includes approximately $3 million of an indemnification receivable recorded last year for our IVC purchase accounting. We have an offsetting tax benefit as a related tax liability was unwound. 
Our income tax rate was 26.4% for the quarter, and that compares to 21.9% last year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to range between 23% and 24%, and our tax rate for the full year next year in 2017 to range between 26% and 27%. Earnings per share excluding charges was $3.50, up 17% over last year.
We turn to the segments. In the Global Ceramics segment, sales were $822 million or up 4% as reported. They increased 6% on a constant days and exchange rate basis. We had very strong growth, both in Europe and in Russia in local currency, with North America growth rate improving over the second quarter. Our operating margin excluding charges was 16.6%. That's up 130 basis points over last year. Contributing to the growth over last year was productivity of $14 million, volume of $6 million and a positive price mix of $7 million, partially offset by $4 million of SG&A investment.
In the Flooring North American segment, sales as reported were $1,009,000,000, up 6% or up 7% using constant days, with the hard surface categories outpacing soft surface. In soft surface, both rugs and commercial carpet grew faster than residential carpet. Our operating margin excluding charges was 15.3%. That's up 140 basis points, primarily from productivity of $16 million and volume of $12 million. 
In the Flooring Rest of World segment, sales as reported were $464 million or up 15% over last year. Our legacy business was up 8% using constant days and constant exchange rates. Our operating margin excluding charges was 18.4%, up 250 basis points, and it was positively impacted by productivity of $10 million and volume of $11 million plus deflation of $7 million. FX negatively impacted operating income by approximately $5 million, primarily from the British pound. We are planning to offset the sterling headwind next quarter with price increases. 
The corporate and eliminations segment had an operating loss of $10 million, and we expect this to be about a $36 million to $38 million loss for the full year. 
Jumping to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1,506,000,000. Our days sales outstanding were up to 56 days compared to 53 days last year due to change in the channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at $1,673,000,000. Our inventory days improved by 1 day to 104 days in the quarter. Fixed assets were $3,341,000,000 and included capital expenditures during the quarter of $184 million, with depreciation and amortization of $104 million. CapEx for the full year is estimated to be approximately $650 million, with depreciation and amortization for the full year of $410 million. 
Long-term debt was about $3 billion, and our leverage debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x.

This year, we're investing at our highest level ever to meet increasing demand around the globe. We are preparing for future growth by expanding our differentiated product offerings and increasing the capacity and efficiency of our operations. With our continued investment in manufacturing technology, we're introducing distinctive collections to improve our sales and enhance our mix. We're aggressively implementing productivity improvements across the enterprise and all facets of our business, and we're bringing new capacity online to support our growth. This year, our strong operating results have expanded our cash flow and reduced our leverage to historically low levels. We are currently exploring numerous investment options to further our expansion, including greenfield opportunities and acquisitions to broaden our geographic presence and product portfolio. 
Taking these factors into account, our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter is $3.16 to $3.25, which represents a 12% to 15% increase over our fourth quarter 2015 EPS, excluding any restructuring charges.
I'll now be glad to take any questions."

We have announced the increase of our plant in Mexico, which is outside Mexico City. It's going to -- we're going to double the capacity of -- that'll be on the end of next year. That's it. Moving to Europe, we're replacing the balance of the assets that we acquired in the high-end part -- that are focused more on the high-end commercial part of the business, those should be in place sometime about midyear, I believe. In addition, we're putting in new capacity to go in the new product category, which makes ceramic slabs, and those can be used for countertops and walls and other pieces as well as floor. We have recently increased the capacity in Bulgaria, and there won't be any more next year. And in Russia, we're increasing our capacity next year to prepare for the Russian market to improve. Let's see if we can move around the world. In the -- I'll sort of combine some of these, because they're intertwined. In the laminate business, we're using all our capacity in the U.S., Europe and Russia presently. We have expansion plans for all 3. Some of the equipment's going to be off. I think it's going to take a while to get it in. We will expand the U.S. in the fall of next year, followed by Europe and followed by Russia, and it's just a matter of timing of the supplier to get the equipment in. In the wood business, we are just -- we have been putting in a new engineered wood plant, which will be starting -- which is in the middle of starting up this fall in engineered wood, which is also running at capacity. The LVT businesses, we're running all the capacity we have in the U.S. and in Europe. Both of those are making incremental increases, as we speak, in each one, and that'll continue to do so probably through the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of adding another production line in both Europe and the U.S., which will be working in the end of next year. And total combined, we'll have about 100 -- over $1 billion of capacity in LVT as a new category. There are some other smaller things, like we just put up a new pad plant in the Western United States, which will fill out our padding strategy across the United States. We have got -- put in new capacity to make 2 new types of rugs recently, and we're looking for alternatives everywhere. The best investments we can make are the ones in internal investment that have the highest paybacks and the lowest risks. The only negative is some of them that would go onto new geographies in pieces, they tend to lose money for the first year or so as you're ramping them up and getting enough volume to go through them.

Residential replacement has not had the same robustness we would've expected going through the cycle, and it's in all the product categories as you go through. In addition, in the carpet piece, there is increasing pressure from declining prices as the market growth in polyester, which sells at lower prices, has reduced the prices. And then with the overcapacities in the carpet industry, the commodity prices have gotten compressed even more. All of those things are reducing the dollar volume of the industry. At the same time, there's been the trend to selling more hard surfaces and the use of more hard surfaces in more places, which has changed the growth rate of the entire industry, and those dynamics are continuing as they have been. As if -- so we're trying to participate in all the pieces. We're trying to make sure that we satisfy the customers in all the different product categories, and our goal is to have our carpet business as large as we can have it, and at the same time, to optimize the other hard surface products, which we participate in all the parts of the business. And then, going back to what we discussed before, having incremental innovation in everything is a huge benefit, and we spend a huge amount of effort trying to create some reasons that customers prefer ours in every single product category."

There's excess capacity in the marketplace. It has pushed the prices and margins down in the business for us and -- but I want to remind you at the same time that our North American Flooring business is operating at historically the highest margin that it's ever been at. So it's just what we have to deal with -- the marketplace. The competition from offshore is there in the different -- in different product categories. The ceramic business, there's probably almost half of the industry comes from offshore somewhere, which includes the biggest pieces coming from Mexico and China, I would guess, would be the 2 biggest. What -- at the same time, the high-end stuff's coming out of Europe -- is it. In the other product categories, each one is different. The laminate business, there's a significant amount that used to come from China, moved to Europe. And there's new capacity coming up, so it's going to move here. You see the LVT with all coming out of China, there's new capacity coming up. It's moving to the U.S. So as -- in these product categories where you can automate it, there's advantages to being local. But at the same time, if -- in the world marketplace, with exchange rates and other pieces, people dump excess capacity into the marketplace. We think that we're well suited to compete. And in the ceramic industry -- and we're actually built -- we own different capacity everywhere. We started this year. We've actually shipped product and ceramics from Russia, Europe and Bulgaria and out of our Chinese relationship into the U.S. to support our business."
