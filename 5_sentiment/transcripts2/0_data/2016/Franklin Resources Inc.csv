I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Market volatility continued this quarter, but we are confident we have the talent, discipline and foresight to continue driving our long-term success. We have a long history of weathering periods like this and emerging stronger as a firm, well-positioned to benefit from the long-term trends driving global markets. Institutional flows rebounded, aided by $5.5 billion global macro mandate that funded in the quarter. Financial results were solid and profitability remained strong, as we implemented a number of cost savings initiatives that reduced year-over-year controllable expenses by 6%. In December, the Board of Directors declared a 20% increase to the regular dividend, which has more than doubled over the past 5 years and we continued our elevated share repurchase activity. In total, we repurchased 10.5 million shares, significantly more than offsetting issuance from long-term equity awards granted in the quarter. 
As Ken mentioned on our last call, while we are implementing a number of cost cutting initiatives this year, we're also investing in growth initiatives. In November, we appointed a new head of global ETFs to help shape and develop our offerings in the ETF space. In early January, we filed an SEC registration statement for an initial suite of strategic beta ETFs branded as Franklin Liberty Q. We believe the addition of strategic beta ETFs will compliment our existing active management product ranges and will offer our clients additional investment solutions and vehicles to construct their investment portfolios. Overall, the investment performance story was little changed from September. In aggregate, the majority of long-term mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their respective peer groups. 
Fixed income funds continue to generate solid long-term relative performance track records, led by the global macro team, while equity and hybrid performance remains pressured as Franklin Income Fund represents roughly 30% of those assets.
We continue to educate advisors on the current positioning of our flagship funds and the prospective behind the portfolio manager's conviction, as these periods of volatility represent opportunities for patient long-term investors. New marketing materials were recently introduced to highlight 5 reasons why investors buy and hold Franklin Income Fund and why we believe Templeton Global Bond Fund represents a once-in-a-decade opportunity. Following the rollout, we have seen strong interest and engagement from clients. We are also pleased to note that MorningStar recently reiterated its bronze rating on the Franklin Income Fund. 
Assets under management ended the quarter at $764 billion, a 1% decrease from September. However, average assets under management were 5% lower at $782 billion.
The mix of assets under management by investment objective and sales region remained consistent with prior quarters. However, we experienced a gradual shift in assets towards institutional and high net worth clients that comprised 28% of assets under management, up from 26% 1 year ago. Long-term net outflows improved somewhat from last quarter to $20 billion due to increased sales and lower redemptions, which have improved since August. Market appreciation at $15 billion offset much of the outflows in the quarter.
Looking closer at flows by client type on Slide 11. From a retail perspective, we faced continued headwinds, particularly for our flagship funds in the U.S. and cross-border markets. U.S. retail redemptions remain elevated, due in large part to expected redemptions from our sub-advised variable annuity business that I mentioned last quarter. The client redeemed nearly $5 billion from its founding fund strategy, which impacted redemptions from U.S. equity, global equity and hybrid categories this quarter by roughly $1.6 billion each. Although the variable annuity business has been under pressure, it only represents about 6% of our assets under management today and we believe the potential exists for this business to resume its growth in the years ahead. As I mentioned last quarter, we're now offering a managed volatility fund for clients looking to reduce risk, as well as introducing new solutions-based products. International retail outflows eased a bit, due primarily to a decrease in redemptions from 3 of our largest cross-border funds: The Templeton Global Bond Fund, Global Total Return Fund and Asian Growth. Institutional sales have been strong year-to-date, due in large part to an Asian client that added a total of $5.5 billion to global macro mandate in the quarter. It's worth noting the client initially funded the mandate in October of $4.8 billion and added another $700 million, taking advantage of some market dislocations later in the quarter. 
We continue to emphasize the growth of our institutional presence globally by refining our value proposition and brand messaging, building and executing channel-specific strategies, investing in infrastructure to support customization and enhanced servicing and optimizing our product line up and pricing. Outflows from global equity strategies remain elevated this quarter, as improving flows in our emerging markets funds were offset by weaker flows from other global equity strategies, including the variable annuity redemption I mentioned. Meanwhile, our local asset management equity teams had another solid quarter, attracting over $300 million of net new flows, which continues a strong growth story that sometimes gets lost amongst the larger parts of the business. Global fixed income net outflows improved to $3.6 billion, due to a combination of increased sales and decreased redemptions. The improvement in redemptions was attributable to the cross-border versions of Templeton Global Bond and Global Total Return Funds that experienced lower redemptions overall this quarter, as well as large institutional redemptions that occurred in the prior quarter.
Sales growth was bolstered by the $5.5 billion global macro mandate that I already highlighted. U.S. equity strategies experienced decreased redemptions that led to moderating net outflows of $3.1 billion, despite slightly lower sales volumes. Like last quarter, U.S. equity flows were negatively impacted by further redemptions from our variable annuity business, including the $1.6 billion redemption I mentioned already, which had a similar impact on hybrid redemptions. Hybrid net new outflows increased to $5.6 billion, with most of that attributable to the Franklin Income Funds. Our K2 liquid alternative strategies continues to be another success story, as assets of both of the U.S. and cross-border fund eclipsed $1 billion at quarter end and continued to generate strong interest from clients. The follow up Franklin K2 Long-Short Credit Fund that launched last quarter has already been approved on 30 advisory and brokerage platforms and we're working on additional strategies that we plan to launch later this year.
Looking at Slide 14, tax-prefixed income funds experienced a strong improvement in redemptions that resulted in nearly break even flows. On a taxable side, a combination of slowing sales, increased redemptions and net exchanges out resulted in net new outflows of $2.5 billion. Funds managed by our high-yield team accounted for about half of the net outflows but increased only modestly from the prior quarter despite the pressure experienced by the high-yield market.
And now, I'll turn it over to Ken for our financial results."
28703,322094111,925203,"Franklin Resources, Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Although lower assets under management and its associated revenue was a headwind, overall, financial results were solid as we implement cost savings initiatives and generated over $650 million in operating income for the quarter.Net income",762,"Thanks, Greg. Although lower assets under management and its associated revenue was a headwind, overall, financial results were solid as we implement cost savings initiatives and generated over $650 million in operating income for the quarter.
Net income improved this quarter. It was almost $450 million and similarly, diluted earnings per share also increased to $0.74. Investment management fee revenue was down 6% this quarter, which was essentially in-line with the decline in average assets under management after excluding the impact of lower performance fees that were only $1.9 million this quarter. Similarly, the decline in assets, as well as the 13 % decline in commissionable sales reduced sales and distribution revenue, which was $478 million. Shareholder servicing fees also decreased this quarter and were $62 million. This was due primarily to lower assets under management and one less day this quarter. Other revenue decreased significantly over the prior quarter to $31 million. Changes in consolidated sponsor investment products drove most of the change here. However, this impact was largely offset in noncontrolling interests. Looking at expenses on Slide 18, total expenses decreased by 4%. Sales, distribution and marketing expense was $589 million, a decrease that was consistent with the decline in sales and distribution revenue. We did see a shift away from non-U.S. assets that generate these fees, which resulted in the net of sales and distribution to decrease, which is summarized in the appendix of the presentation. 
Compensation and benefits expense came in at $343 million and that was a 2% increase over the prior quarter. This reflected a decrease in variable compensation that was more than offset by increases in salary, wages and benefits, which included severance expense of $13 million. Last quarter, I provided guidance that we expected 2016 expense levels, excluding sales and distribution region expense, to be 3% to 4% below 2015 levels and that the realization of those savings could be deferred by execution costs.
Currently, we think that we'll realize savings at the upper end of that range and are looking for ways to increase that number. As a result, we expect to incur additional severance costs in future quarters. Next quarter, considering the normal seasonal increase in compensation and estimated severance, we expect a quarter-over-quarter increase in compensation expense of approximately 9% to 12%. We still anticipate year-over-year compensation expense savings of about 3%, inclusive of those charges.
Information systems and technology expense of $51 million reflected both seasonal factors and a number of expense reductions. Occupancy expense was $31 million but going forward, we expect the run rate for this item to look more like the fourth quarter of last year. General administrative and other expenses was down 1% this quarter. There were a number of reductions to advertising, promotional and traveling expenses. However, the mark-to-market of the liability related to the prior acquisition almost entirely offset the impact of those items.
As you can see on Slide 19, the operating margin remained strong at 37.2% this quarter but decreased a bit due to lower revenue. However, expense reductions mitigated margin compression to some extent. The tax rate was 31.2% this quarter and this was in line with prior guidance for the fiscal year, which we still believed to be a reasonable estimate for 2016. Moving on to other income net of noncontrolling interest was $27 million this quarter. The key driver of the change from last quarter was equity method investments that were a gain of $25 million and a reflection of the improvement in equity markets during the quarter.
Looking now at capital management, the board announced a 20% increase in the regular dividend this quarter, which has more than doubled over the past 5 years. As you can see, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend has substantially outpaced that of the peer group average over all time periods, included on Slide 22. Share purchase activity remained elevated as the stock remained under pressure, while volume slowed modestly. In fact, we repurchased 10.5 million shares in the quarter for a total cost of over $400 million, which significantly more than offset issuance from long-term equity awards.
Looking at the payout on Slide 24, the total payout for the trailing 12 months was $1.7 billion or 88% of net income. As this chart clearly illustrates, we've recently demonstrated a relative preference for share repurchase versus dividends given Ben's current valuation but the board remains committed to the long-term growth of the regular dividend.
That concludes my comments. We look forward to talking with you on the call later today."

So early to quantify any behavioral changes there. I think what you're trying to do is get the tools in the advisers hands so they can quickly sit down with their clients and walk them through logic on why you would stay put in a period where there's a lot of headlines around high-yield and stress in liquidity and make sure that they have a broad understanding of what is going on with those funds. I think the other point I would make is just around because I think that's the question I would look at as when would you see your are flagship flows returning, and I think when I look at the income fund, its long history and it's a well-diversified portfolio, but it's always one that doesn't fit neatly in any category. It will always have high-yield exposure, it will always be the highest yielding in its category. So it would be naturally a little bit more risky than its peer group. So you will expect to have periods where lags performance. I think the other side of fixed income, as I've said before, when the markets settle and high-yield settles and you have very attractive spreads to where certainly Treasuries are today, you have 6 plus yield on a fund that's done very well long-term. I think it's very easy to get momentum back in flows, a little bit easier than equity fund. Just the attractiveness of that coupon and the history and that's where I would expect to see a turn. I guess, really when the markets settle on the high-yield bond market settles in, I would expect to see that fund start to get and, hopefully, better sales."

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Market volatility continued this quarter, but we are confident that we have the talent, discipline and foresight to continue driving our long-term success. 
We have a long history of weathering periods like this and emerging stronger as a firm, well-positioned to benefit from the long-term trends driving global markets. Institutional flows rebounded, aided by $5.5 billion global macro mandate that funded in the quarter. Financial results were solid and profitability remained strong as we implemented a number of cost savings initiatives that reduced year-over-year controllable expenses by 6%. 
In December, the Board of Directors declared a 20% increase to the regular dividend, which has more than doubled over the past 5 years, and we continued our elevated share repurchase activity. In total, we repurchased 10.5 million shares, significantly more than offsetting issuance from long-term equity awards granted in the quarter. 
As Ken mentioned on our last call, while we are implementing a number of cost-cutting initiatives this year, we're also investing in growth initiatives. In November, we appointed a new head of global ETFs to help shape and develop our offerings in the ETF space. And in early January, we filed an SEC registration statement for an initial suite of strategic beta ETFs branded as Franklin LibertyQ.
We believe the addition of strategic beta ETFs will complement our existing active management product ranges and will offer our clients additional investment solutions and vehicles to construct their investment portfolios. Overall, the investment performance story was little changed from September. In aggregate, the majority of long-term mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their respective peer groups. 
Fixed income funds continue to generate solid long-term relative performance track records, led by the global macro team, while equity and hybrid performance remains pressured as Franklin Income Fund represents roughly 30% of those assets.
We continue to educate advisers on the current positioning of our flagship funds and the perspective behind the portfolio manager's conviction as these periods of volatility represent opportunities for patient long-term investors. New marketing materials were recently introduced to highlight 5 reasons why investors buy and hold Franklin Income Fund and why we believe Templeton Global Bond Fund represents a once-in-a-decade opportunity. 
Following the rollout, we have seen strong interest and engagement from clients. We're also pleased to note that Morningstar recently reiterated its bronze rating on the Franklin Income Fund. Assets under management ended the quarter at $764 billion, a 1% decrease from September. However, average assets under management were 5% lower at $782 billion.
The mix of assets under management by investment objective and sales region remained consistent with prior quarters. However, we experienced a gradual shift in assets towards institutional and high net worth clients that comprised 28% of assets under management, up from 26% 1 year ago. 
Long-term net outflows improved somewhat from last quarter to $20 billion due to increased sales and lower redemptions, which have improved since August. Market appreciation of $15 billion offset much of the outflows in the quarter.
Looking closer at flows by client type on Slide 11. From a retail perspective, we've faced continued headwinds, particularly from our flagship funds in the U.S. and cross-border markets. U.S. retail redemptions remained elevated, due in large part to expected redemptions from our sub-advised variable annuity business that I mentioned last quarter. 
The client redeemed nearly $5 billion from its founding fund strategy, which impacted redemptions from U.S. equity, global equity and hybrid categories this quarter by roughly $1.6 billion each. Although the variable annuity business has been under pressure, it only represents about 6% of our assets under management today, and we believe the potential exists for this business to resume its growth in the years ahead. As I mentioned last quarter, we're now offering a managed volatility fund for clients looking to reduce risk as well as introducing new solutions-based products. 
International retail outflows eased a bit, due primarily to a decrease in redemptions from 3 of our largest cross-border funds: the Templeton Global Bond Fund, Global Total Return Fund and Asian Growth. Institutional sales have been strong year-to-date, due in large part to an Asian client that added a total of $5.5 billion to global macro mandate in the quarter. It's worth noting the client initially funded the mandate in October with $4.8 billion and added another $700 million, taking advantage of some market dislocations later in the quarter. 
We continue to emphasize the growth of our institutional presence globally by refining our value proposition and brand messaging, building and executing channel-specific strategies, investing in infrastructure to support customization and enhanced servicing and optimizing our product lineup and pricing. 
Outflows from global equity strategies remained elevated this quarter, as improving flows in our emerging markets funds were offset by weaker flows from other global equity strategies, including the variable annuity redemption I mentioned. Meanwhile, our local asset management equity teams had another solid quarter attracting over $300 million of net new flows, which continues a strong growth story that sometimes gets lost amongst the larger parts of the business. 
Global fixed income net outflows improved to $3.6 billion, due a combination of increased sales and decreased redemptions. The improvement in redemptions was attributable to the cross-border versions of Templeton Global Bond and Global Total Return Funds that experienced lower redemptions overall this quarter as well as a large institutional redemption that occurred in the prior quarter.
Sales growth was bolstered by the $5.5 billion global macro mandate that I already highlighted. U.S. equity strategies experienced decreased redemptions that led to moderating net outflows of $3.1 billion, despite slightly lower sales volumes. Like last quarter, U.S. equity flows were negatively impacted by further redemptions from our variable annuity business, including the $1.6 billion redemption I mentioned already, which had a similar impact on hybrid redemptions. 
Hybrid net new outflows increased to $5.6 billion, with most of that attributable to the Franklin Income Funds. Our K2 Liquid Alternative Strategies continues to be another success story as assets of both the U.S. and cross-border fund eclipsed $1 billion at quarter end and continued to generate strong interest from clients. 
The follow-up Franklin K2 Long Short Credit Fund that launched last quarter has already been approved on 30 advisory and brokerage platforms, and we're working on additional strategies that we plan to launch later this year.
Looking at Slide 14. Tax-free fixed income funds experienced a strong improvement in redemptions that resulted in nearly breakeven flows. On the taxable side, a combination of slowing sales increased redemptions and net exchanges out resulted in net new outflows of $2.5 billion. 
Funds managed by our high-yield team accounted for about half of the net outflows, but increased only modestly from the prior quarter despite the pressure experienced by the high-yield market.
And now, I'll turn it over to Ken for our financial results."
28703,322094111,925642,"Franklin Resources, Inc., Q1 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Although lower assets under management and its associated revenue was a headwind, overall, financial results were solid as we implemented cost savings initiatives and generated over $650 million in operating income for the quarter.Net inco",762,"Thanks, Greg. Although lower assets under management and its associated revenue was a headwind, overall, financial results were solid as we implemented cost savings initiatives and generated over $650 million in operating income for the quarter.
Net income improved this quarter and was almost $450 million. And similarly, diluted earnings per share also increased to $0.74. Investment management fee revenue was down 6% this quarter, which was essentially in line with the decline in average assets under management after excluding the impact of lower performance fees that were only $1.9 million this quarter. 
Similarly, the decline in assets as well as a 13 % decline in commissionable sales reduced sales and distribution revenue, which was $478 million. Shareholder servicing fees also decreased this quarter and were $62 million. This was due primarily to lower assets under management and one less day this quarter. Other revenue decreased significantly over the prior quarter to $31 million. Changes in consolidated sponsored investment products drove most of the change here. However, this impact was largely offset in noncontrolling interests. 
Looking now at expenses on Slide 18. Total expenses decreased by 4%. Sales, distribution and marketing expense was $589 million, a decrease that was consistent with the decline in sales and distribution revenue. We did see a shift away from non-U.S. assets that generate these fees, which resulted in the net of sales and distribution to decrease, which is summarized in the appendix of the presentation. 
Compensation and benefits expense came in at $343 million, and that was a 2% increase over the prior quarter. This reflected a decrease in variable compensation that was more than offset by increases in salary, wages and benefits, which included severance expense of $13 million. 
Last quarter, I provided guidance that we expected 2016 expense levels, excluding sales and distribution expense, to be 3% to 4% below 2015 levels and that the realization of those savings could be deferred by execution costs.
Currently, we think that we'll realize savings at the upper end of that range and are looking for ways to increase that number. As a result, we expect to incur additional severance costs in future quarters. Next quarter, considering the normal seasonal increase in compensation and estimated severance, we expect a quarter-over-quarter increase in compensation expense of approximately 9% to 12%. We still anticipate year-over-year compensation expense savings of about 3% inclusive of those charges.
Information systems and technology expense of $51 million reflected both seasonal factors and a number of expense reductions. Occupancy expense was $31 million, but going forward, we expect the run rate for this item to look more like the fourth quarter of last year. General, administrative and other expenses was down 1% this quarter. There were a number of reductions to advertising, promotional and travel expenses. However, the mark-to-market of a liability related to a prior acquisition almost entirely offset the impact of those items.
As you can see on Slide 19, the operating margin remained strong at 37.2% this quarter, but decreased a bit due to lower revenue. However, expense reductions mitigated margin compression to some extent. The tax rate was 31.2% this quarter, and this was in line with prior guidance for the fiscal year, which we still believe to be a reasonable estimate for 2016. 
Moving on to other income. Net of noncontrolling interest was $27 million this quarter. The key driver of the change from last quarter was equity method investments that were a gain of $25 million and a reflection of the improvement in equity markets during the quarter.
Looking now at capital management. The board announced a 20% increase in the regular dividend this quarter, which has more than doubled over the past 5 years. As you can see, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend has substantially outpaced that of the peer group average over all-time periods included on Slide 22. 
Share purchase activity remained elevated as the stock remained under pressure, while volume slowed modestly. In fact, we repurchased 10.5 million shares in the quarter for a total cost of over $400 million, which significantly more than offset issuance from long-term equity awards.
Looking at the payout on Slide 24. The total payout for the trailing 12 months was $1.7 billion or 88% of net income. As this chart clearly illustrates, we've recently demonstrated a relative preference for share repurchase versus dividends given BEN's current valuation, but the board remains committed to the long-term growth of the regular dividend.
That concludes my comments. We look forward to talking with you on the call later today."

What this market volatility has led us to conclude is that we should just be looking at all of our business and seeing where we can increase efficiencies, leverage efficiencies. And that's what we're doing and that's going to be a theme for probably the next 9 months. And that's just based on the volatility. We're not assuming that market is going to be up or down, but it's obvious that they're volatile so we need to be looking at our expenses closely."

So I think if that trend continues, that will be important. I think the other part, as Ken said, is really looking at our entire business and validating everything we're doing. And I think part of the changing distribution landscape advisers, looking at our industry and what they need differently, I think the -- if you have redundancy with certain funds, or it's just not clear what that fund offers in the various category that advisers need, we may need to tune some of the lineup or merge some of the lineup.

So early to quantify any behavioral changes there. I think the -- what you're trying to do is get the tools in the advisers hands so they can quickly sit down with their clients and walk them through the logic on why you would stay put in a period where there's a lot of headlines around high-yield and stress in liquidity and make sure that they have a broad understanding of what is going on with those funds. I think the other point I would make is just around, because I think that's the question that I would look at, is when would you see your flagship flows returning? And I think when I look at the income fund, its long history and it is a well-diversified portfolio, but it's always one that doesn't fit neatly in any category. It will always have high-yield exposure, it will always be the highest yielding in its category. So it would be naturally a little bit more risky than its peer group. So you will expect to have periods where it lags performance. I think the other side of fixed income, as I've said before, when the market settle and high-yield settles and you'll have very attractive spreads to where certainly treasuries are today, then you'll have a 6-plus yield on a fund that's done very well long term. I think it's very easy to get momentum back in flows, a little bit easier than equity fund. Just the attractiveness of that coupon and the history, that's where I would expect to see a turn. So I think it's really just when the market settle, when the high-yield bond market settles in, I would expect to see that fund start to get lower redemptions and hopefully, better sales."

So for us, that's another one that we -- with the Fintech space and looking at robo-advisors is something we certainly are studying. Whether or not we need to go acquire one or to build that capability, I think that's a question that we're looking at today. And I think the opportunity for the industry as distribution landscape changes, as we go to more advisory driven models, is the traditional barriers between a broker-dealer fund sold group versus the direct group continue to erode and disappear in a pretty quick pace. I think the opportunity is what does that mean for investment management firms. And I think that's why a lot of groups are looking at. And for us, I mentioned the partnership that we're doing with a large global bank and using our solutions capabilities targeting the emerging affluent market through digital marketing to existing customers in the bank. And that's very similar to what a robo-advisor can do. These are funds that are multi-asset and have a lot of different -- they have other managers than Franklin Templeton in them, and we can do that. That's somewhat what a robo-advisor can deliver. And to me, there's not a lot of magic over there, there to what a robo-advisor can do versus a solutions group can do or anybody modeling out. And I think the direct space, the Vanguards and the traditional people in that space, or Schwab, have a pretty good head start on dealing with that marketplace as far as robo-advisor."

So early to quantify any behavioral changes there. I think the -- what you're trying to do is get the tools in the advisers hands so they can quickly sit down with their clients and walk them through the logic on why you would stay put in a period where there's a lot of headlines around high-yield and stress in liquidity and make sure that they have a broad understanding of what is going on with those funds. I think the other point I would make is just around, because I think that's the question that I would look at, is when would you see your flagship flows returning? And I think when I look at the income fund, its long history and it is a well-diversified portfolio, but it's always one that doesn't fit neatly in any category. It will always have high-yield exposure, it will always be the highest yielding in its category. So it would be naturally a little bit more risky than its peer group. So you will expect to have periods where it lags performance. I think the other side of fixed income, as I've said before, when the markets settle and high-yield settles and you'll have very attractive spreads to where certainly treasuries are today, then you'll have a 6-plus yield on a fund that's done very well long term. I think it's very easy to get momentum back in flows, a little bit easier than an equity fund. Just the attractiveness of that coupon and the history, that's where I would expect to see it turn. So I think it's really just when the market settle, when the high-yield bond market settles in, I would expect to see that fund start to get lower redemptions and hopefully, better sales."

Whether or not we need to go acquire one or to build that capability, I think that's a question that we're looking at today. And I think the opportunity for the industry as distribution landscape changes, as we go to more advisory driven models, is the traditional barriers between a broker-dealer fund sold group versus the direct group continue to erode and disappear at a pretty quick pace. I think the opportunity is what does that mean for investment management firms. And I think that's why a lot of groups are looking at. And for us, I mentioned the partnership that we're doing with a large global bank and using our solutions capabilities targeting the emerging affluent market through digital marketing to existing customers in the bank. And that's very similar to what a robo-advisor can do. These are funds that are multi-asset and have a lot of different -- they have other managers than Franklin Templeton in them, and we do that. That's somewhat what a robo-advisor can deliver. And to me, there's not a lot of magic or there, there to what a robo-advisor can do versus a solutions group can do or anybody modeling out. And I think the direct space, the Vanguards and the traditional people in that space, or Schwab, have a pretty good head start on dealing with that marketplace as far as robo-advisor."

As the quarter progressed, investment performance of many of our key strategies improved, as did redemption trends.

But we estimate it affects about $130 billion of our assets. I think we're probably a little bit lower than most because of our heavy concentration in retail assets offshore as well as municipal bond funds and the fact that the key area around 401(k  tends to be in the U.S. growth, and that's an area where we don't have huge penetration. So I think overall, a little bit lower, but like everybody in the industry, very concerned about and still trying to understand what 1,000-page document means to our business.

No, I think all multi-assets are huge category that continues, I think, to garner more attention in the distribution channels. And I think for a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more -- the flagship areas like the income fund, which somewhat has been multi-asset before people started calling it that, you've seen a pretty strong rebound in 2 quarters of performance. And that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth if these trends continue that have really been moving the last -- that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from just a fund lone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to 1.9 this quarter. And that continues to improve. So that's always been a big driver of net flow. I think the global bond one is a little bit harder, different category and not -- while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration and rate's continuing to decline. It needs a backup and rates. If the rates back up, that will see significant organic growth, I think, pretty darn quickly because it will be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment. So I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that you can go. But certainly, the multi-asset category is a huge one.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO.  The March quarter began with continued challenges for our business as global equities got of to the worst start in the New Year since the depths of the global financial crisis. Many markets and then rebounded sharply from mid-February lows to finish the quarter in positive territory. This rebound also marked encouraging transition for us as many of our weakest performing sectors and regions of 2015 were among the strongest performers in the quarter. And several of our key strategies benefited from this location. 
Longer-term performance remains mixed with the relative underperformance of some of our larger strategies still weighing aggregate asset we did perform in numbers and flows. However, we did start to see some encouraging signs in the form of improved performance, as well as improved redemption trends as the quarter progressed. 
Financial results for the quarter were solid, as we continued to exercise expense disciplines despite some notable one-time items. The firm also demonstrated strong capital management returning nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months. 
We continue to invest in future growth opportunities such as the recent expansion of our multi-asset solution capabilities with a new customized, open architecture offering that enables global financial institutions to address the needs of their specific global investor base, in area, where we've seen strong strong interest and momentum. 
This quarter, we also continued to build out our local asset management capabilities with a launch of a new polish fund umbrella after receiving our license from a local regular last quarter. The fund launch is a natural evolution of our business in Poland. We've had a presence since 1997 and we're today, we have 3 offices and more than 700 employees. 
Looking at aggregated long-term investment performance on Slide 6, relative performance remain mixed across the organization, but we're encouraged by some recent performance trends. Franklin Income Fund for example, benefited from broad-based strength across equity holdings, traditionally defensive activity sectors such as utilities, energy and telecoms that offer high dividend yields rallied in the wake lower rates and higher energy prices. The fund has seen a strong improvement in performance, ranking in the top quartile against it's peer groups for the trailing 3 and 6 month period and Morningstar respectively. 
Other Franklin strategies also generated strong performance. Franklin rising dividends for example, outperformed nearly all category peers in the benchmark during the quarter. And we're already seeing an increase across our U.S. retail distribution teams. 
Emerging market strategies, including the Templeton Asian growth fund delivered strong absolute and relative returns in the quarter. Global international fixed income performance also improved this quarter, with at least 90% of the assets in the category exceeding the peer group median for the 5 and 10-year periods. 
Looking now at assets under management, monthly average assets were $737 billion for the quarter and ending assets of $743 billion. Thanks to the market rebound at the end of the quarter. 
The mix of assets by investment objective on Slide 9 remained essentially unchanged again this quarter. 
Looking at the change in assets under management on Slide 10, lower sales and elevated redemptions continue to be a long-term new outflows that were $24 billion this quarter. Market appreciation was about $4 billion and this was due to flattish market returns for the quarter and a foreign exchange benefit of about $5 billion. 
Retail sales continued to be challenging given ongoing volatility, concerns of energy prices and performance; however, strong near-term performance trends did contribute to improved retail redemptions that decline 20% from the prior quarter. Most of the changes in U.S. retail many of our largest funds saw improving trends in net new flows. 
Institutional net flows were hit harder this quarter, due to large part to a handful of lumpy redemptions. Most of these redemptions were outside of our control such as model allocation changes and other clients needs to raise liquidity. 
Global equity strategies remained too net outflows this quarter as improving flows for simple funds for more than offset by institutional redemptions. The 2 largest redemptions totaled $1.8 billion, but were not performance related. 
Global international fixed income outflows increased due to lower sales, but most of that was a result of the large institutional funding of $5.5 billion in the prior quarter. 
Net new flows of our Templeton Global Bond Fund and return funds generally reflected that of overall retail flows, with outflows of the U.S. registered funds improving somewhat, while cross border outflows increased moderately. 
U.S. equity and hybrid funds both experienced improved net new flows due mainly to increasing redemptions. In the hybrid category, Franklin income flows improved with sales up 13% and redemptions down 17%, which nearly cut outflows in half compared to last quarter. 
fund sales improved notably this quarter resulting in a return to positive net new flows as investors started to recognizing the benefit of less volatile tax rebounds. Redemptions in U.S. taxable fixed income strategies eased this quarter led by our U.S. government fund that returned to positive net new flows. Now I'll hand it over to Ken for financial results"

The company generated $537 million in operating income and net income of $360 million. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.61, a decrease of 18% from the prior quarter, which was 2% better than the decline and net income to our continued stock repurchase activity. 
On Slide 17, total revenue for the quarter declined 8% to $1.6 billion. Investment and management fees of $1.1 billion the decline in revenue due to the lower average assets under management and the shorter quarter. 
While simple monthly average assets under management declined by just under 6%, daily average assets under management actually decreased by almost 8%. The shorter quarter further reduced investment management fees, but this was more than offset by performance fees of about $20 million. 
Additionally, having fewer days to earn revenue decreased average effective fee dates slightly as did market volatility. In fact, the rate would have been almost the basis point higher if or calculated using daily average assets under management in startup simple monthly. 
Sales and distribution fees were $437 million and this was consistent with the decline in assets and sales as great discussed, as well as the impact of the shorter quarter. Shareholders servicing fees were $262 million and were essentially flat over the prior quarter. 
Lower dividends from consolidated progress decreased other revenue, which was $20 million this quarter, but most of this was offset in noncontrolling interest as Slide 27 illustrates. 
Overall, expenses declined this quarter by 3% due mostly to the decline in sales and distribution expense, which was $532 million. The decline in the asset and sales-based portion of this expense was consistent with the lower assets and sales was formed;, however, slide 26 illustrates a decline in non-U.S. assets caused the asset basics expense to decrease at a greater rate than the asset base revenue. 
When combined with an accounting adjustment of reduce the amortization of deferred sales commissions by about $5 million, net sales and distribution fees increased by about $15 million this quarter. Compensation and benefits expense was $374 million, which was towards the low lower end of prior guidance.  Included in this line was $40 million of severance cost from the voluntary separation plan we offered U.S. employees, as well as other workforce reduction efforts. 
Additionally, the season of resumption of payroll taxes impacted second quarter compensation expense. Information systems and technology expensive declined slightly to $50 million that we do expect to see seasonal uptick through the back half of the fiscal year. 
Occupancy expense of $33 million was a bit lower-than-expected due to additional cost savings that we're budgeting for this line to trend upward over the next two quarters. General, administrative and other expense was $88 million this quarter and while we made additional reductions to advertising, travel and entertainment expenses, there are number of one-time items creating some noise here this quarter. Longer-term, we expect this expense to moderate a bit and some seasonal increase in the fourth quarter and the year-over-year change being essentially flat. 
Looking more broadly, we now anticipated overall year-over-year decline in expenses, excluding sales and distribution vision expenses to be closer to 3%. The fiscal year-to-date operating margin pulled back to 35.3% due primarily to lower revenues, but also from some large one-time items this quarter. The tax rate increased a bit this quarter due to a shift in end the mix towards the U.S. and was 32.2% for the fiscal year-to-date period. We are currently assuming the similar income mix for the remainder of the year and some discrete items would impact very income in quarters and for those reasons we now expect the fiscal year-to-date to follow within 31.5% to 32.5%. 
Looking now at Slide 20. Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interests was $12.5 million this quarter, realized gains and available for sales investments and an increase in trading investments were largely offset by losses from equity method investments, and a negative foreign exchange impact of about $10 million. 
Looking now at capital management. This quarter represented another attractive period for share repurchases as the average share price continued to decline. In fact, we repurchased about 9.6 million shares in the quarter for a total of almost $340 million. Cumulative repurchases over the last 5 years have added compound average annual accretion to investors of 2.5%, which is, of course, and net of dilution the end of employees, which come favorably to other U.S. asset managers. Importantly, we maintain considerable financial flexibility with respect to potential acquisitions, dividend growth and our aggressive share repurchase activity. 
Repurchases and the steadily increasing dividend combined for a total payout of nearly $1.9 billion over the trailing 12 months, which represents a payout ratio of over 100%. And that concludes our comments this morning. We look forward to talking with you on the call later today."

Cumulative repurchases over the last 5 years have added compound average annual accretion to investors of 2.5%, which is, of course, net of dilution from grants to employees, which continues to compare favorably to other U.S. asset managers. Importantly, we maintain considerable financial flexibility with respect to potential acquisitions, dividend growth and/or aggressive share repurchase activity. 
Repurchases and steadily increasing dividend combined for a total payout of nearly $1.9 billion over the trailing 12 months, which represents a payout ratio of over 100%. And that concludes our comments this morning. We look forward to talking with you on the call later today."

The March quarter began with continued challenges for our business as global equities got of to their worst start in",886,"Hello, and thank you for listening our commentary on second quarter results. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO.  The March quarter began with continued challenges for our business as global equities got of to their worst start in the New Year since the depths of the global financial crisis. Many markets then rebounded sharply from mid-February lows to finish the quarter in positive territory. This rebound also marked an encouraging transition for us as many of our weakest performing sectors and regions of 2015 were among the strongest performers in the quarter. And several of our key strategies benefited from this rotation. 
Longer-term performance remains mixed with the relative underperformance of some of our larger strategies still weighing on aggregate asset weighted performance numbers and flows. However, we did start to see some encouraging signs in the form of improved performance as well as improved redemption trends as the quarter progressed. 
Financial results for the quarter were solid, as we continued to exercise expense disciplines despite some notable one-time items. The firm also demonstrated strong capital management, returning nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months. 
We continue to invest in future growth opportunities such as the recent expansion of our multi-asset solution capabilities with a new customized, open architecture offering that enables global financial institutions to address the needs of their specific global investor base, an area where we've seen strong interest and momentum. 
This quarter, we also continued to build out our local asset management capabilities with the launch of a new polish fund umbrella after receiving our license from the local regular last quarter. The fund launch is a natural evolution of our business in Poland where we've had a presence since 1997, and where today, we have 3 offices and more than 700 employees. 
Looking at aggregated long-term investment performance on Slide 6, relative performance remain mixed across the organization, but we're encouraged by some recent performance trends. Franklin Income Fund, for example, benefited from broad-based strength across equity holdings. Traditionally defensive equity sectors such as utilities, energy and telecoms that offer high dividend yields rally in the wake of lower rates and higher energy prices. The fund has seen a strong improvement in performance, ranking in the top quartile against it's peer groups for the trailing 3 and 6 month period in Lipper and Morningstar respectively. 
Other Franklin growth sector and value strategies also generated strong performance. Franklin Rising Dividends, for example, outperformed nearly all category peers in the benchmark during the quarter. And we're already seeing an increase across our U.S. retail distribution teams. 
Emerging market strategies, including the Templeton Asian growth fund delivered strong absolute and relative returns in the quarter. Global international fixed income performance also improved this quarter, with at least 90% of the assets in the category exceeding the peer group median for the 5 and 10-year periods. 
Looking now at assets under management, monthly average assets was $737 billion for the quarter and ending assets of $743 billion, thanks to the market rebound at the end of the quarter. 
The mix of assets by investment objective, on Slide 9, remained essentially unchanged again this quarter. 
Looking at the change in assets under management on Slide 10, lower sales and elevated redemptions continued to weigh on long-term net new outflows that were $24 billion this quarter. Market appreciation was about $4 billion and this was due to flattish market returns for the quarter and a foreign exchange benefit of about $5 billion. 
Retail sales continued to be challenged given ongoing volatility, concerns over energy prices and performance; however, strong near-term performance trends did contribute to improved retail redemptions that declined 20% from the prior quarter. Most of the change is in U.S. retail where many of our largest funds saw improving trends in net new flows. 
Institutional net flows were hit harder this quarter, due in a large part to a handful of lumpy redemptions. Most of these redemptions were outside of our control such as model allocation changes and other clients needs to raise liquidity. 
Global equity strategies remained a net outflows this quarter as improving flows from several funds were more than offset by institutional redemptions. The 2 largest redemptions totaled $1.8 billion but were not performance related. 
Global international fixed income outflows increased due to lower sales, but most of that was a result of the large institutional funding of $5.5 billion in the prior quarter. 
Net new flows of our Templeton Global Bond and Total Return Funds generally reflected that of overall retail flows, with outflows of the U.S. registered funds improving somewhat, while cross border outflows increased moderately. 
U.S. equity and hybrid funds both experienced improved net new flows due mainly to improving redemptions. In the hybrid category, Franklin income flows improved with sales up 13% and redemptions down 17%, which nearly cut outflows in half compared to last quarter. 
Muni fund sales improved notably this quarter, resulting in a return to positive net new flows as investors started to recognize the benefit of less volatile tax free bonds. Redemptions in our U.S. taxable fixed income strategies eased this quarter led by our U.S. government fund that returned to positive net new flows. Now I'll hand it over to Ken for financial results"

Although lower assets under management were a headwind this quarter. Financial results remained solid. The company generated $537 million in operating income and net income of $360 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.61, a decrease",829,"Thanks, Greg. Although lower assets under management were a headwind this quarter. Financial results remained solid. The company generated $537 million in operating income and net income of $360 million. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.61, a decrease of 18% from the prior quarter, which was 2% better than the decline in net income due to our continued stock repurchase activity. 
On Slide 17, total revenue for the quarter declined 8% to $1.6 billion. Investment and management fees of $1.1 billion paced the decline in revenue due to the lower average assets under management and the shorter quarter. 
While simple monthly average assets under management declined by just under 6%, daily average assets under management actually decreased by almost 8%. The shorter quarter further reduced investment management fees, but this was more than offset by performance fees of about $20 million. 
Additionally, having fewer days to earn revenue decreased our effective fee rate slightly as did market volatility. In fact, the rate would have been almost a basis point higher if it were calculated using daily average assets under management instead of simple monthly. 
Sales and distribution fees were $437 million and this was consistent with the decline in assets and sales as Greg discussed, as well as the impact of the shorter quarter. Shareholders servicing fees were at $62 million and were essentially flat over the prior quarter. 
Lower dividends from consolidated products decreased other revenue, which was $20 million this quarter, but most of this was offset in noncontrolling interest as Slide 27 illustrates. 
Overall expenses declined this quarter by 3% due mostly to the decline in sales and distribution expense, which was $532 million. The decline in the asset and sales-based portion of this expense was consistent with the lower assets and sales across the firm; however, slide 26 illustrates a decline in non-U.S. assets caused the asset-based expense to decrease at a greater rate than the asset-based revenue. 
When combined with an accounting adjustment that reduce the amortization of deferred sales commissions by about $5 million, net sales and distribution fees increased by about $15 million this quarter. Compensation and benefits expense was $374 million, which was towards the low lower end of prior guidance.  Included in this line was $40 million of severance costs from the voluntary separation plan we offered to U.S. employees as well as other workforce reduction efforts. 
Additionally, the season of resumption of payroll taxes impacted second quarter compensation expense. Information systems and technology expense declined slightly to $50 million that we do expect to see seasonal uptick through the back half of the fiscal year. 
Occupancy expense of $33 million was a bit lower-than-expected due to additional cost savings that we are budgeting for this line to trend upward over the next two quarters. General, administrative and other expense was $88 million this quarter. And while we made additional reductions to advertising, travel and entertainment expenses, there are number of one-time items creating some noise here this quarter. Longer-term, we expect this expense to moderate a bit with some seasonal increase in the fourth quarter and the year-over-year change being essentially flat. 
Looking more broadly, we now anticipate an overall year-over-year decline in expenses, excluding sales and distribution expenses to be closer to 3%. The fiscal year-to-date operating margin pulled back to 35.3% due primarily to lower revenues, but also from some large one-time items this quarter. The tax rate increased a bit this quarter due to a shift in income mix towards the U.S. and was 32.2% for the fiscal year-to-date period. We are currently assuming a similar income mix for the remainder of the year and some discrete items could impact the rate in coming quarters, and for those reasons, we now expect the fiscal year rate to fall within 31.5% to 32.5% range. 
Looking now at Slide 20. Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interests was $12.5 million this quarter. Realized gains on available for sale investments and an increase in trading investments were largely offset by losses from equity method investments and a negative foreign exchange impact of about $10 million. 
Looking now at capital management. This quarter represented another attractive period for share repurchases as the average share price continued to decline. In fact, we repurchased about 9.6 million shares in the quarter for a total of almost $340 million. Cumulative repurchases over the last 5 years have added compound average annual accretion to investors of 2.5%, which is, of course, net of dilution from grants to employees, which continues to compare favorably to other U.S. asset managers. Importantly, we maintain considerable financial flexibility with respect to potential acquisitions, dividend growth and/or aggressive share repurchase activity. 
Repurchases and a steadily increasing dividend combined for a total payout of nearly $1.9 billion over the trailing 12 months, which represents a payout ratio of over 100%. And that concludes our comments this morning. We look forward to talking with you on the call later today."

I think we're probably a little bit lower than most because of our heavy concentration in retail assets offshore as well as municipal bond funds and the fact that the key area around 401(k) tends to be in U.S. growth, and that's an area where we don't have huge penetration.

I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more the flagship areas, like the income fund, which somewhat is -- has been a multi-asset before people started calling it that. You've seen a pretty strong rebound in 2 quarters of performance, and that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth if these trends continue that have really been moving the last -- that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from just the fund lone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to $1.9 billion this quarter. And that continues to improve. So that's always been a big driver of net flows. I think the global bond one is a little bit harder, a different category. And not -- while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration and rate's continuing to decline. It needs a back-up in rates. And if rates back up, that will see significant organic growth, I think, pretty darn quickly because it'll be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment. So I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that you can grow. But certainly, the multi-asset category is a huge one.

And so -- yes, part of the reason that the net line has been going down is because of the assets under management had been going down. So if you look forward a couple of quarters, I would expect that the net number would be able bit less than it has been. I think it's been -- I'm going to guess, like $115 billion, something like that. And then probably, it might go -- we're thinking now, flat markets might go down to like $105 billion net per quarter."

I think multi-asset is a huge category that continues, I think, to garner more attention in the distribution channels. And I think for a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more the flagship areas like the income fund, which somewhat is -- has been a multi-asset before people started calling it that. You've seen a pretty strong rebound in 2 quarters of performance, and that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth if these trends continue that have really been moving the last -- that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from just the fund alone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to $1.9 billion this quarter. And that continues to improve. So that's always been a big driver of net flows. I think the global bond one is a little bit harder, a different category. And not -- while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration and rate's continuing to decline. It needs a back-up in rates. And if rates back up, that will see significant organic growth, I think, pretty darn quickly because it'll be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment. So I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that you can grow. But certainly, the multi-asset category is a huge one.

And for us, Poland is also a -- one of our operations and servicing centers for Europe, and we have a lot of employees that have a strong presence there. And it is a growing middle class in that market. And you take markets like a Taiwan that, for us, years ago, somebody would have said, ""Why are you bothering with that?"" But they can become very meaningful if you have an early dominant position. So it's not taking away any resources for us.

And you look at even emerging markets that had a better quarter. Value was up 7.5% and growth was up 3.3%. 
So you have, I think, the turnaround and what people have been looking for, whether it's currencies doing better, a broad oil, obviously, rebounding, and that affects probably 4 major groups’ performance right now with the energy exposure and also the high-yield exposure and income fund. I think all of that can turn pretty quickly. I don't know exactly which ones are right. I didn't -- I haven't looked at that to say, the 3-year number, who is within 2 percentage points or that.

I think, for us, it's difficult to get an exact number on the amount of assets that it potentially could affect, but we did our best. And with omnibus accounts, that's a little bit tricky. But we estimate it affects about $130 billion of our assets. I think we're probably a little bit lower than most because of our heavy concentration in retail assets offshore as well as municipal bond funds and the fact that the key area around 401(k) tends to be in U.S. growth, and that's an area where we don't have huge penetration. So I think overall, a little bit lower, but like everybody in the industry, very concerned about and still trying to understand what a 1,000-page document means to our business. And that's really where we're focused today is working with our advisers, working with outside legal assistants and really making sense of the proposal.

I think multi-asset is a huge category that continues, I think, to garner more attention in the distribution channels. And I think for a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more the flagship areas like the income fund, which somewhat is -- has been a multi-asset before people started calling it that. You've seen a pretty strong rebound in 2 quarters of performance, and that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth if these trends continue that have really been moving the last -- that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from just the fund alone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to $1.9 billion this quarter. And that continues to improve. So that's always been a big driver of net flows. I think the global bond one is a little bit harder, a different category. And not -- while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration and rate's continuing to decline. It needs a back-up in rates. And if rates back up, that will see significant organic growth, I think, pretty darn quickly because it'll be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment. So I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that you can grow. But certainly, the multi-asset category is a huge one. And you've seen what's happened in Europe with it. So there's no reason why that can't happen here in the U.S. as well."

But we estimate it affects about $130 billion of our assets. I think we're probably a little bit lower than most because of our heavy concentration in retail assets offshore as well as municipal bond funds and the fact that the key area around 401(k) tends to be in U.S. growth, and that's an area where we don't have huge penetration. So I think overall, a little bit lower, but like everybody in the industry, very concerned about and still trying to understand what a 1,000-page document means to our business.

I think multi-asset is a huge category that continues, I think, to garner more attention in the distribution channels. And I think for a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more the flagship areas like the income fund, which somewhat is -- has been a multi-asset before people started calling it that. You've seen a pretty strong rebound in 2 quarters of performance, and that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth if these trends continue that have really been moving the last -- that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from just the fund alone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to $1.9 billion this quarter. And that continues to improve. So that's always been a big driver of net flows. I think the global bond one is a little bit harder, a different category. And not -- while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration and rate's continuing to decline. It needs a back-up in rates. And if rates back up, that will see significant organic growth, I think, pretty darn quickly because it'll be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment. So I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that you can grow. But certainly, the multi-asset category is a huge one. And you've seen what's happened in Europe with it. So there's no reason why that can't happen here in the U.S. as well."

And you look at even emerging markets that had a better quarter. Value was up 7.5% and growth was up 3.3%. 
So you have, I think, the turnaround and what people have been looking for, whether it's currencies doing better, a broad oil, obviously, rebounding, and that affects probably 4 major groups’ performance right now with the energy exposure and also the high-yield exposure and income fund.

Certainly, since the announcement, I would say trying to make sense of the 1,100 pages. It's a little bit like a Rubik's cube where we're making progress and realize we've got 2 other problems. So I think we're getting some clarity around where it's heading. We talked about a standard class of shares. That's something that within the best interest contract can work. I think we're seeing some broker-dealers committed to doing the brokerage side and others saying it's not something they're going to do. I think the initial reaction that you're going to have a ton of money moving into the advisory side, I think once we really look at what that means, there's other implications of the rule that may mean monies that are held that paid a front-end sales charge should stay where they are and not move to the advisory because that would actually increase cost. So I think we are making a lot more sense of the rule. I think the net results are also that there'll be less funds on platforms. We're seeing that, again, more of that consultant gatekeeper approach and narrowing the funds that any broker-dealer follows. So I think that puts pressure on smaller funds out there to get distribution and ultimately, less advisers. I think you'll see more retirements as this transition will be too much. And then just issues, simple things that sound -- again, I mean having a robo adviser for a small account, but can you have your own ETFs within that robo advise under the rule? I mean these are the kind of problems that I think are coming up. And obviously, the lawyers are trying to clarify that, and we're working with many in the meantime. But I think the net effect for us is have some kind of standardized pricing. We -- obviously, we don't want to have 100 different pricing structures out there and are trying to come to some new standards that works for most of our -- most broker-dealers and advisers, and that's really where we are."

I mean, I think we're always careful how to talk about flows beyond the quarter. I think the big one for us that, as I stated before, that tends to snap back of the fastest is the Franklin Income Fund which you look at that category just 2 quarters ago, we had a hybrid $5.6 billion in net redemptions and last quarter, $2.2 billion. So I think that, that trend, we hope, will continue as people the -- even in the last quarter, the 3-year number or the 5-year number actually improved to back to the second quartile. And hopefully in another -- the end of this month, hopefully, we'll be back in the second quartile for the 1 year. And as we stated earlier, we're at the 80% [ph] year-to-date. So that's a pretty big recovery there I think that that's where you'll see the improvement flows. I think we have some good stories as well on the equity side with one of our largest funds at Franklin Rising Dividend funds, $17 billion, $18 billion fund doing extremely well right now and getting a lot of attention for its performance, which is first quartile for the 1 year, second quartile for 3 and 5. Franklin Growth also very strong. So I think those are areas where we could see a turnaround in flows. And I think as long as the market is stable, the other trends should continue as well."

We did have -- I think the other one on the -- just in general, I talked about the varied annuity business and how that's going to change. And certainly, with the DOL, we'll have more changes. But we have seen some groups get out of that business, so they're really going to wind down. So it kind of changes what they're looking for on their platform. And we, with our solutions group, we're doing our best to transition those assets. But they're the ones still you have a pipeline of redemptions over the next, say, 2 years as those groups are transitioning out of that business. So I would guesstimate that you probably have $5 billion-plus in assets over the next 2 years that will transition. Hopefully, we can capture some of that, but it will go out of the traditional funds into a lower fee type solution to meet whatever liability they have. So those would be the big changes that have driven the lumpier redemptions, and we think will continue to create some headwinds in the next 2 years on the VA side."

So that doesn't seem like an attractive alternative. I think we also believe that active -- that there are forces at work over the last 5, 10 years that have contributed to the passive strategies. And once active outperforms and that tends to be in a more of a rising rate environment, historically, I think that conventional wisdom could shift pretty quickly, and that's something we firmly believe. But in the meantime, we have built out our solutions. We're looking at our multi-asset capabilities. We're getting a lot of interest in that, and that's just another area how we can add value to investors by combining different asset classes over time. So that's going to be an important growth area.

It does offer something very different, and that will be one of the few games in town if rates actually do go up at some point.

So at the beginning, maybe it would be a little bit of a different story, but what we had captured a lot of good relative performance during the quarter, which unfortunately in the last couple of weeks when you had more of a risk of environment, you lost some of that which has been gained back in July. So I think it's really just looking at the flagship products for us and also munis, that's a strength area for us.

The good news is that our results are pretty straightforward for this quarter. So hopefully, the commentary we made available earlier this morning provided much what you're looking for.
To quickly recap, although we experienced another quarter of net outflows, we did see encouraging signs with redemptions continuing to slow and improving investment performance, particularly Franklin Income Fund that, as of July, ranks in the top quartile against peers for the trailing 1-year period.
Financial results and capital management were solid as operating income increased 11%, and the trailing 12 months payout was $2 billion.
Now we'll be happy to take your questions."

And I would -- I still think that's the one area that continues to be under pressure where we are seeing improvements in a lot of other areas in terms of flows, but the global bond, that's the one that continues to be under pressure. And I think if you look at the other area that I would call out just in terms of flows, because I think it is a little bit confusing, is the global equity net flows that increased, and redemptions increased there. And I want to point to there were 3 lumpy one-time institutional redemptions within that, that totaled $3.5 billion out of global equity.

And I would point out it was a long time ago but 2005 when they had that, you can look to see what we did there. So depending on -- it all depends on what we think is the best long-term interest of the shareholders, what we do. But in 2005, we did repatriate some money, and so that's not an unreasonable thing to expect, but it depends on what the law is. The cash continues to grow, and we're just planning to continue our capital management strategy that we've been doing over the last few years.

Certainly, since the announcement, I would say trying to make sense of the 1,100 pages. It's a little bit like a Rubik's cube where we're making progress and then turn it over and realize we've got 2 other problems. So I think we are getting some clarity around where it's heading. We talked about a standard class of shares. That's something that within the best interest contract can work. I think we're seeing some broker-dealers committed to doing the brokerage side and others saying it's not something they're going to do. I think the initial reaction that you're going to have a ton of money moving into the advisory side. I think once we really look at what that means, there's other implications of the rule that may mean monies that are held that paid a front-end sales charge should stay where they are and not move to the advisory because that would actually increase costs. So I think we are making a lot more sense of the rule. I think the net results are also that there'll be less funds on platforms. We're seeing that, again, more of that consultant gatekeeper approach and narrowing the funds that any broker-dealer follows. So I think that puts pressure on smaller funds out there to get distribution and ultimately, less advisers. I think you'll see more retirements as this transition will be too much. And then just issues, simple things that sound -- again, I mean having a robo-adviser for a small account, but can you have your own ETFs within that robo advise under the rule? I mean these are the kind of problems that I think are coming up. And obviously, the ERISA lawyers are trying to clarify that, and we're working with many in the meantime. But I think the net effect for us is to have some kind of standardized pricing. We -- obviously, we don't want to have 100 different pricing structures out there and are trying to come to some new standard that works for most of our -- most broker-dealers and advisers, and that's really where we are."

I think the big one for us that, as I stated before, that tends to snap back the fastest is the Franklin Income Fund, which you look at that category just 2 quarters ago, we had a hybrid $5.6 billion in net redemptions and last quarter, $2.2 billion. So I think that, that trend, we hope, will continue as people the -- even in the last quarter, the 3-year number or the 5-year number actually improved to back to the second quartile. And hopefully in another -- the end of this month, hopefully, we'll be back in the second quartile for the 1 year. And as we stated earlier, we're at the 80th percentile for year-to-date.

I think we have some good stories as well on the equity side with one of our largest funds, a Franklin Rising Dividend fund, a $17 billion, $18 billion fund doing extremely well right now and getting a lot of attention for its performance, which is first quartile for the 1 year, 3 -- second quartile for 3 and 5. Franklin Growth, also very strong. So I think those are areas where we could see a turnaround in flows. And I think as long as the market is stable, the other trends should continue as well."

I think they're -- the main driver when we talked about a platform change was one of our large broker-dealers that we worked with building it in-house sub-advice platform and was moving some assets, and it was $1.1 billion out of our mutual discovery fund. So that's a one-off event that's not performance related that drove that. We did have -- I think the other one on the -- just in general, I talked about the variable annuity business and how that's undergoing change. And certainly, with the DOL, we'll have more changes. But we have seen some groups get out of that business so they're really going to wind down. So it kind of changes what they're looking for on their platform. And we, with our solutions group, we're doing our best to transition those assets. But they're the ones that still you have a pipeline of redemptions over the next, say, 2 years as those groups are transitioning out of that business. So I would guesstimate that you probably have $5 billion-plus in assets over the next 2 years that will transition. Hopefully, we can capture some of that, but it will go out of the traditional funds into a lower fee type solution to meet whatever liability they have. So those would be the big changes that have driven the lumpier redemptions, and I think we'll continue to create some headwinds in the next 2 years on the VA side."

But in the meantime, we have built out our solutions. We're looking at our multi-asset capabilities.

It does offer something very different, and that it will be one of the few games in town if rates actually do go up at some point.

And hopefully, at some level, you'll get some efficiencies out of that as we get better at providing useful information on a realtime basis through digital side, which has been a big emphasis in trying to reach more advisers in a more efficient way.

You did see an improvement in rotation happening, a rotation into value as well. And if you look at the quarter, I mean, Brexit kind of hit right at the end of the quarter. So if it was at the beginning, maybe it would be a little bit of a different story, but what we had captured a lot of good relative performance during the quarter, which unfortunately in the last couple of weeks, when you had more of a risk off environment, you lost some of that which has been gained back in July. So I think it's really just looking at the flagship products for us. And also munis have been -- that's a strength area for us.

I have been struck by not only the fact that your company is having very stable, not growing, but very stable fixed income growth sales and so were many of your competitors. It's surprising to me given that there was no yield and that -- and the duration risk is very substantial should interest rates rise over the next couple of years.

But at the end of the day, it's very hard to take a portfolio and just ignore fixed income. It -- you put a lot more risk into that given portfolio if you go 100% equities. But at the end of the day, you look at something like munis. It still has an attractive yield relative to the treasury market, certainly on an after-tax basis. And the general consensus right now, right or wrong, is that rates are not going up.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO, and we're here to provide our commentary on third quarter results. As a quick reminder, our 10-Q was also filed this morning and additional details on results can be found there. The June quarter was challenging for the industry as the introduction of new regulations by the Department of Labor and the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union led to increased uncertainty. On the positive side, we are seeing encouraging developments on the investment performance front where we saw improvements across all major categories over the trailing 1-year period. Equity and hybrid fund performance improved across a 1, 3, 5 and 10-year periods. We continue to experience net outflows that we did see an improvement in flows from nearly all investment objectives as redemptions have steadily declined over the past several quarters. Financial results were solid with operating income of almost $600 million and 11% increase from Q2. We also continue to demonstrate strong capital management as we repurchased an additional 9 million shares in the quarter, bringing our fiscal year to date repurchased to over 29 million. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares to ensure we have the flexibility to execute our capital management strategy going forward. This quarter also marked an exciting milestone for us, the introduction of Franklin LibertyShares, a new exchange traded fund platform. In June, we launched our first suite of strategic beta ETFs under the name of Liberty Q. The new suite includes 3 multifactor core portfolio funds and one with a dividend focus. This launch was supported by a significant marketing push demonstrating our commitment to this new initiative. We continue to build out our ETF team and plan to launch additional funds in the months ahead, including some active strategies. Turning to aggregate long-term performance on Slide 6, I'm encouraged by our improved relative performance across equity and hybrid funds, most notably, Franklin Income Fund had another strong quarter with year-to-date relative performance ranking in the 8th percentile driven by positive returns across asset classes and sectors, but, most notably by the recent recovery in energy markets. As of quarter-end relative performance for the 1 and 3-year periods were still below the peer average but 5-year performance has recovered to the top 2 quartiles. Performance in July continues to be strong and trailing 1-year performance against its Morningstar and Lipper peers was nearly in the top quartile again. We've also seen a strong rebound in performance of Franklin Rising Dividends Fund, which now ranks in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods and contributed to an improved 3-year number. Fixed income performance remained solid for the 5 and 10-year periods, however, near-term performance softened a bit. The primary driver of bond performance rankings remains our global strategies, which were negatively impacted by our relatively short duration and certain currency position specifically their net short position in the end, which has rebounded nicely in July. Assets under management ended the quarter at $732 billion as was previously disclosed. Monthly average assets increased a bit. However, daily average assets actually increased 1.5%. Our asset mix remain stable with a near 50-50 split between equities and bonds. We assume a similar split in hybrid assets though our mix clearly skews towards global. From a sales region perspective, we remain roughly 2/3 of U.S., 1/3 international. It's worth reiterating that our sales region disclosure represents where the sale occurred, not the investment strategy, nor where the products are managed or domicile. There had been a number of questions on the potential impacts of the Brexit vote on our business and while much remains unknown, we do not believe it will have a major impact on the way our firm operates in the U.K. or the services we provide our customers there. Furthermore, we have other regulated subsidiaries across continental Europe should there be future restrictions on cross-border trade and financial products and services between the U.K. and Continental Europe. Currently, we do not anticipate any significant impact to the distribution of our funds because our flagship cross-border fund vehicle is a Luxembourg domiciled CCAD range, which is distributed in 39 countries worldwide including the U.K. and Continental Europe. Our U.K.-based open-end investment company ranges targeted to U.K. investors only and is not passported into the EU. If in the future, European clients wish or need to contract a management company based in the new EU, we already have the regulated entities to service our need there. We've heard a number of concerns over the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule and the strength of our business in the broker dealer channel, as well as the amount of assets under management currently in Class A shares. We believe this has led to some notable misunderstandings. We've been successful over the past 65 years because we work hard to develop strong relationships with the clients and trust our track record with the brand we built neither of which will be affected by this rule. Product structure and pricing has been evolving for decades, and we're confident that we can continue to evolve with it. We are actively engaged with all of our primary clients and partners to understand the impact of this rule, which will be different for each firm so it's not possible to generalize on the impact of the rule for the industry or for us at this time. Not only will each of our partners pursue the most appropriate response to the rule for their own business, but that decision will have very different impacts on our business because of the nature of our relationship with each partner bearings. Looking at the component changes and assets under management, long-term net new outflows improved this quarter and were $19.2 billion as redemptions dropped at that the lowest level since the second quarter of 2013. Market appreciation of $10 billion partially offset the impact of outflows this quarter. While ongoing volatility, concerns over energy prices and performance challenges continue to negatively impact our retail business, we are encouraged by the continued decline in redemptions in both the U.S. and internationally. While overall sales remain under pressure, international retail sales increased for the first time since the second quarter of 2014. Global equity outflows increased to about $8 billion this quarter due to a $1.7 billion institutional redemption from our Canadian business. Some of our retail global equity funds also saw increased redemption activity this quarter as a platform changed by one of our key distributors resulted in a $1 billion reduction from the mutual global discovery fund that. Global fixed income redemptions declined for the U.S. and cross-border versions of the Templeton global bond and total return funds leading to net outflows of about $7 billion for the quarter. However, sales have not yet rebounded due to short-term performance challenges. We've been working hard to communicate the global macro team's positioning and strategy via the new global macro shifts hub, which serves as an educational resource for investors and fits more broadly into our What's Next for bond markets marketing campaign. We saw a rebound in U.S. equity sales this quarter, led by Franklin utilities and Franklin Biotech Funds, which reduced net outflows to $1.6 billion. Hybrid net outflows improved again this quarter. The key driver of hybrid flows remains Franklin Income Fund, which has seen redemptions eased and a modest rebound in sales since February. Improving sales and redemption trends, along with net exchanges back into the fund over the past 4 months have yielded a significant reduction in monthly net outflows from the fund. Sustained performance and a rebound of the net asset value should support a rebound in sales. Tax-free fixed income was a clear positive in the quarter with about $400 million in net inflows. Performance of our larger tax refunds has been good. And we're seeing increased interest in the asset class with a number of our funds in positive territory. U.S. taxable fixed income remains under pressure with $1.6 billion in outflows driven by net redemptions from several high-yield funds, but to the positive redemptions declined again this quarter. Now I'll turn it over to Ken for financial results."

Compared to the prior quarter, operating income increased 11% to $595 million and net income increased to $446 million. Earnings per share of $0.77 was a 26% increase from last quarter and 2% ahead of net income growth due to the lower share count. Total revenues of $1.6 billion were slightly higher the last quarter. Investment management fees were essentially flat compared with the second quarter as the impact of higher daily average assets under management was offset by lower performance fees. Excluding performance fees of $1.5 million, the effective fee rate base on the daily average assets under management was unchanged. Sales and distribution fees were $450 million reflecting increased commissionable sales from our U.S. and cross-border funds and increased asset base fees in the U.S. Shareholders service fees were flat while higher consolidated sponsored investment product revenue led to the increase in other revenue. Operating expenses decreased 4%, with the most expense categories flat or down with exception of sales, distribution and marketing expense, which was higher due to increases in related revenue, as well as adjustments impacting the amortization of deferred sales commissions. Compensation expense decreased by nearly $50 million due to lower severance costs this quarter as well as other factors such as lower payroll taxes and other variable expenses due to in part to lower headcount. IT and occupancy expense were relatively flat and general and administrative expense decreased to $75 million with most of the variance related to the prior quarters intangible asset impairment and the mark-to-market of the contingent liability. Looking at Slide 19, the decrease in expenses edge the fiscal year-to-date operating margin up to 35.7% and the tax rate for the quarter was 29% as our projected rate for the fiscal year decreased 120 basis points. This decrease was largely due to a change in estimated earnings mix to lower tax jurisdictions. Assuming a similar mix in the fourth quarter, we currently anticipate a fiscal year tax rate of around 31%. Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interests was $68 million, an increase of more than $50 million since of the second quarter due to a number of factors that illustrated on Slide 20 and described in more detail on our 10-Q. Turning to capital management. As Greg mentioned, we repurchased 9.3 million shares during the quarter, taking advantage of lower prices in June, more so than in the first 2 months of the quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date period, we repurchased 29.4 million shares or about 5% of shares outstanding. This represented virtually all of the additional shares authorized for the repurchase back in October so our Board authorized an additional 50 million shares at their most recent meeting in June. When we announced the share repurchase authorization, we saw a number of conclusions drawn from that announcement and I just want to clarify that he did not reflect a change in our capital management approach or our priorities. Combined with dividends, the trailing 12 months payout was $2 billion, representing a total payout ratio that once again exceeded 100%. And that concludes our comments on this quarter's results. We look forward to speaking with you on the call later today."

And I would point out it was a long time ago but 2005 when they had that, you can look to see what we did there. So depending on -- it all depends on what we think is the best long-term interest of the shareholders, what we do. But in 2005, we did repatriate some money, and so that's not an unreasonable thing to expect, but it depends on what the law is. The cash continues to grow, and we're just planning to continue our capital management strategy that we've been doing over the last few years.

Certainly, since the announcement, I would say trying to make sense of the 1,100 pages. It's a little bit like a Rubik's cube where we're making progress and then turn it over and realize we've got 2 other problems. So I think we are getting some clarity around where it's heading. We talked about a standard class of shares. That's something that within the best interest contract can work. I think we're seeing some broker-dealers committed to doing the brokerage side and others saying it's not something they're going to do. I think the initial reaction that you're going to have a ton of money moving into the advisory side. I think once we really look at what that means, there's other implications of the rule that may mean monies that are held that paid a front-end sales charge should stay where they are and not move to the advisory because that would actually increase costs. So I think we are making a lot more sense of the rule. I think the net results are also that there'll be less funds on platforms. We're seeing that, again, more of that consultant gatekeeper approach and narrowing the funds that any broker-dealer follows. So I think that puts pressure on smaller funds out there to get distribution. And, ultimately, less advisers. I think you'll see more retirements as this transition will be too much. And then just issues, simple things that sound -- again, I mean having a robo-adviser for a small account, but can you have your own ETFs within that robo advise under the rule? I mean these are the kind of problems that I think are coming up. And obviously, the ERISA lawyers are trying to clarify that, and we're working with many in the meantime. But I think the net effect for us is to have some kind of standardized pricing. We -- obviously, we don't want to have 100 different pricing structures out there and are trying to come to some new standard that works for most of our -- most broker-dealers and advisers, and that's really where we are."

So I think that, that trend, we hope, will continue as people the -- even in the last quarter, the 3-year number or the 5-year number actually improved to back to the second quartile. And hopefully in another -- the end of this month, hopefully, we'll be back in the second quartile for the 1 year. And as we stated earlier, we're at the 8th percentile for year-to-date. So that's a pretty big recovery there, and I think that that's where you'll see the improvement flows. I think we have some good stories as well on the equity side with one of our largest funds, a Franklin Rising Dividend fund, a $17 billion, $18 billion fund doing extremely well right now and getting a lot of attention for its performance, which is first quartile for the 1 year, 3 -- second quartile for 3 and 5.

We did have -- I think the other one on the -- just in general, I talked about the variable annuity business and how that's undergoing change. And certainly, with the DOL, we'll have more changes. But we have seen some groups get out of that business so they're really in a wind-down. So it kind of changes what they're looking for on their platform. And we, with our solutions group, we're doing our best to transition those assets. But they're the ones that still you have a pipeline of redemptions over the next, say, 2 years as those groups are transitioning out of that business. So I would guesstimate that you probably have $5 billion-plus in assets over the next 2 years that will transition. Hopefully, we can capture some of that, but it will go out of the traditional funds into a lower fee type solution to meet whatever liability they have. So those would be the big changes that have driven the lumpier redemptions, and I think we'll continue to create some headwinds in the next 2 years on the VA side."

Each individual firm, we look at separately. And so you had an overexposure to energy, had an overexposure to Europe. Those were trending nicely until Brexit. And even if you look at the trend in equities to quality away from more of your traditional momentum, strong balance sheets, rising dividends, quality earnings, those were all trends that fit nicely into our -- generally, into our philosophy with many of our equity funds. You did see an improvement in rotation happening, a rotation into value as well. And if you look at the quarter, I mean, Brexit kind of hit right at the end of the quarter. So if it was at the beginning, maybe it would be a little bit of a different story, but what we had captured a lot of good relative performance during the quarter, which unfortunately in the last couple of weeks, when you had more of a risk off environment, you lost some of that which has been gained back in July. So I think it's really just looking at the flagship products for us. And also munis have been -- that's a strength area for us. And munis are very attractive in this environment and should continue to be. So I think that that's counter to what is happening on -- and a result of a lot of the, I think, uncertainty in equity markets, money moving into munis right now. So that's another factor as well."

I have been struck by not only the fact that your company is having very stable, not growing, but very stable fixed income growth sales and so were many of your competitors. It's surprising to me given that there is no yield and that -- and the duration risk is very substantial should interest rates rise over the next couple of years. My question, given all that, the absence of yield, the duration, the loss of principal risk, why do you think fixed income across the industry is doing as well as it is in terms of gross inflows?"

I think you are correct that where we sit in a cycle, I think many would argue that there's greater risk from rates going up, that's certainly the position within our Global Bond Fund. But at the end of the day, it's very hard to take a portfolio and just ignore fixed income. It -- you'd put a lot more risk into that given portfolio if you go 100% equities. But at the end of the day, you look at something like munis. It still has an attractive yield relative to the treasury market, certainly on an after-tax basis. And the general consensus right now, right or wrong, is that rates are not going up. So I think there's a sense of security that even in these -- with these small yields, they're going to be fine for X number of years."

And we're here to provide our commentary on third quarter results. As a quick reminder, our 10-Q was also filed this morning and additional details on results can be found there. The June quarter was challenging for the industry as the introduction of new regulations by the Department of Labor and the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union led to increased uncertainty. 
On the positive side, we are seeing encouraging developments on the investment performance front where we saw improvements across all major categories over the trailing 1-year period. Equity and hybrid fund performance improved across 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. We continue to experience net outflows that we did see an improvement in flows from nearly all investment objectives as redemptions have steadily declined over the past several quarters.
Financial results were solid with operating income of almost $600 million and 11% increase from Q2. We also continue to demonstrate strong capital management as we repurchased an additional 9 million shares in the quarter, bringing our fiscal year to date repurchases to over 29 million. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares to ensure we have the flexibility to execute our capital management strategy going forward.
This quarter also marked an exciting milestone for us, the introduction of Franklin LibertyShares, a new exchange traded fund platform. In June, we launched our first suite of strategic beta ETFs under the name Liberty Q. The new suite includes 3 multifactor core portfolio funds and one with a dividend focus. This launch was supported by a significant marketing push demonstrating our commitment to this new initiative. We continue to build out our ETF team and plan to launch additional funds in the months ahead, including some active strategies.
Turning to aggregate long-term performance on Slide 6, I'm encouraged by our improved relative performance across equity and hybrid funds, most notably, Franklin Income Fund had another strong quarter with year-to-date relative performance ranking in the 8th percentile driven by positive returns across asset classes and sectors, but most notably, by the recent recovery in energy markets. As of quarter-end relative performance for the 1- and 3-year periods were still below the peer average, but 5-year performance has recovered to the top 2 quartiles. Performance in July continues to be strong and trailing 1-year performance against its Morningstar and Lipper peers was nearly in the top quartile again. We've also seen a strong rebound in performance of Franklin Rising Dividends Fund, which now ranks in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods and contributed to an improved 3-year number.
Fixed income performance remained solid for the 5- and 10-year periods, however, near-term performance softened a bit. The primary driver of bond performance rankings remains our global strategies, which were negatively impacted by our relatively short duration and certain currency position specifically their net short position in the end, which has rebounded nicely in July. Assets under management ended the quarter at $732 billion as was previously disclosed. Monthly average assets increased a bit. However, daily average assets actually increased 1.5%. Our asset mix remain stable with a near 50-50 split between equities and bonds. We assume a similar split in hybrid assets though our mix clearly skews towards global.
From a sales region perspective, we remain roughly 2/3 U.S., 1/3 international. It's worth reiterating that our sales region disclosure represents where the sale occurred, not the investment strategy, nor where the products are managed or domiciled.
There have been a number of questions on the potential impacts of the Brexit vote on our business and while much remains unknown, we do not believe it will have a major impact on the way our firm operates in the U.K. or the services we provide to our customers there. Furthermore, we have other regulated subsidiaries across continental Europe should there be future restrictions on cross-border trade and financial products and services between the U.K. and Continental Europe. Currently, we do not anticipate any significant impact to the distribution of our funds because our flagship cross-border fund vehicle is a Luxembourg domiciled CCAD range, which is distributed in 39 countries worldwide including the U.K. and Continental Europe. Our U.K.-based open-end investment company ranges targeted to U.K. investors only and is not passported into the EU. If in the future, European clients wish or need to contract a management company based in the new EU, we already have the regulated entities to service our need there. We've heard a number of concerns over the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule and the strength of our business in the broker dealer channel, as well as the amount of assets under management currently in Class A shares. We believe this has led to some notable misunderstandings.
We've been successful over the past 65 years because we work hard to develop strong relationships with the clients who trust our track record with the brand we built neither of which will be affected by this rule. Product structure and pricing has been evolving for decades, and we're confident that we can continue to evolve with it. We are actively engaged with all of our primary clients and partners to understand the impact of this rule, which will be different for each firm so it's not possible to generalize on the impact of the rule for the industry or for us at this time. Not only will each of our partners pursue the most appropriate response to the rule for their own business, but that decision will have very different impacts on our business because of the nature of our relationship with each partner bearings.
Looking at the component changes and assets under management, long-term net new outflows improved this quarter and were $19.2 billion as redemptions dropped at the lowest level since the second quarter of 2013. Market appreciation of $10 billion partially offset the impact of outflows this quarter. While ongoing volatility, concerns over energy prices and performance challenges continue to negatively impact our retail business, we are encouraged by the continued decline in redemptions in both the U.S. and internationally. While overall sales remain under pressure, international retail sales increased for the first time since the second quarter of 2014. Global equity outflows increased to about $8 billion this quarter due to a $1.7 billion institutional redemption from our Canadian business. Some of our retail global equity funds also saw increased redemption activity this quarter as a platform changed by one of our key distributors resulted in a $1 billion redemption from the mutual global discovery fund. Global fixed income redemptions declined for the U.S. and cross-border versions of the Templeton global bond and total return funds leading to net outflows of about $7 billion for the quarter.
However, sales have not yet rebounded due to short-term performance challenges. We've been working hard to communicate the global macro team's positioning and strategy via the new global macro shifts hub, which serves as an educational resource for investors and fits more broadly into our What's Next for bond markets marketing campaign.
We saw a rebound in U.S. equity sales this quarter, led by Franklin utilities and Franklin Biotech Funds, which reduced net outflows to $1.6 billion. Hybrid net outflows improved again this quarter. The key driver of hybrid flows remains Franklin Income Fund, which has seen redemptions eased and a modest rebound in sales since February. Improving sales and redemption trends, along with net exchanges back into the fund over the past 4 months have yielded a significant reduction in monthly net outflows from the fund. Sustained performance and a rebound of the net asset value should support a rebound in sales.
Tax-free fixed income was a clear positive in the quarter with about $400 million in net inflows. Performance of our larger tax refunds has been good. And we're seeing increased interest in the asset class with a number of our funds in positive territory. U.S. taxable fixed income remains under pressure with $1.6 billion in outflows driven by net redemptions from several high-yield funds, but to the positive redemptions declined again this quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken for financial results."

Third quarter financial results were strong as we started to see prior quarters cost saving initiatives reflected in the results. Compared to the prior quarter, operating income increased 11% to $595 million and net income increased to $4",554,"Thank you, Greg. Third quarter financial results were strong as we started to see prior quarters cost saving initiatives reflected in the results. Compared to the prior quarter, operating income increased 11% to $595 million and net income increased to $446 million. Earnings per share of $0.77 was a 26% increase from last quarter and 2% ahead of net income growth due to the lower share count.
Total revenues of $1.6 billion were slightly higher the last quarter. Investment management fees were essentially flat compared with the second quarter as the impact of higher daily average assets under management was offset by lower performance fees. Excluding performance fees of $1.5 million, the effective fee rate base on the daily average assets under management was unchanged. Sales and distribution fees were $450 million reflecting increased commissionable sales from our U.S. and cross-border funds and increased asset base fees in the U.S. 
Shareholders service fees were flat while higher consolidated sponsored investment product revenue led to the increase in other revenue.
Operating expenses decreased 4%, with the most expense categories flat or down with exception of sales, distribution and marketing expense, which was higher due to increases in related revenue, as well as adjustments impacting the amortization of deferred sales commissions.
Compensation expense decreased by nearly $50 million due to lower severance costs this quarter as well as other factors such as lower payroll taxes and other variable expenses due in part to lower headcount. IT and occupancy expense were relatively flat and general and administrative expense decreased to $75 million with most of the variance related to the prior quarters intangible asset impairment and the mark-to-market of the contingent liability.
Looking at Slide 19, the decrease in expenses edge the fiscal year-to-date operating margin up to 35.7% and the tax rate for the quarter was 29% as our projected rate for the fiscal year decreased 120 basis points. This decrease was largely due to a change in estimated earnings mix to lower tax jurisdictions. Assuming a similar mix in the fourth quarter, we currently anticipate a fiscal year tax rate of around 31%. Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interests was $68 million, an increase of more than $50 million since of the second quarter due to a number of factors that illustrated on Slide 20 and described in more detail in our 10-Q.
Turning to capital management. As Greg mentioned, we repurchased 9.3 million shares during the quarter, taking advantage of lower prices in June, more so than in the first 2 months of the quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date period, we repurchased 29.4 million shares or about 5% of shares outstanding. This represented virtually all of the additional shares authorized for the repurchase back in October so our board authorized an additional 50 million shares at their most recent meeting in June. When we announced the share repurchase authorization, we saw a number of conclusions drawn from that announcement, and I just want to clarify that it did not reflect a change in our capital management approach or our priorities. Combined with dividends, the trailing 12 months payout was $2 billion, representing a total payout ratio that once again exceeded 100%.
And that concludes our comments on this quarter's results. We look forward to speaking with you on the call later today."

The good news is that our results are pretty straightforward for this quarter. So hopefully, the commentary we made available earlier this morning provided much what you're looking for.
To quickly recap, although we experienced another quarter of net outflows, we did see encouraging signs with redemptions continuing to slow and improving investment performance, particularly Franklin Income Fund that, as of July, ranks in the top quartile against peers for the trailing 1-year period.
Financial results and capital management were solid as operating income increased 11%, and the trailing 12 months payout was $2 billion.
Now we'll be happy to take your questions."

And I would -- I still think that's the one area that continues to be under pressure where we are seeing improvements in a lot of other areas in terms of flows, but the global bond, that's the one that continues to be under pressure. And I think if you look at the other area that I would call out just in terms of flows, because I think it is a little bit confusing, is the global equity net flows that increased, and redemptions increased there. And I want to point to there were 3 lumpy one-time institutional redemptions within that, that totaled $3.5 billion out of global equity.

And we think -- well the consensus that we hear is probably sometime in 2017, there might be something that involves corporate tax reform. And I would point out it was a long time ago but 2005 when they had that, you can look to see what we did there. So depending on -- it all depends on what we think is the best long-term interest of the shareholders, what we do. But in 2005, we did repatriate some money, and so that's not an unreasonable thing to expect, but it depends on what the law is. The cash continues to grow, and we're just planning to continue our capital management strategy that we've been doing over the last few years. And essentially, our payout ratio is more than cash generated or net income, and that means we're using U.S. cash, but U.S. cash is still a healthy number, so we don't expect any material change in our strategy."

Certainly, since the announcement, I would say trying to make sense of the 1,100 pages. It's a little bit like a Rubik's cube where we're making progress and then turn it over and realize we've got 2 other problems. So I think we are getting some clarity around where it's heading. We talked about a standard class of shares. That's something that within the best interest contract can work. I think we're seeing some broker-dealers committed to doing the brokerage side and others saying it's not something they're going to do. I think the initial reaction that you're going to have a ton of money moving into the advisory side. I think once we really look at what that means, there's other implications of the rule that may mean monies that are held that paid a front-end sales charge should stay where they are and not move to the advisory because that would actually increase costs. So I think we are making a lot more sense of the rule. I think the net results are also that there'll be less funds on platforms. We're seeing that, again, more of that consultant gatekeeper approach and narrowing the funds that any broker-dealer follows. So I think that puts pressure on smaller funds out there to get distribution. And ultimately, less advisers. I think you'll see more retirements as this transition will be too much. And then just issues, simple things that sound -- again, I mean having a robo-adviser for a small account, but can you have your own ETFs within that robo advise under the rule? I mean these are the kind of problems that I think are coming up. And obviously, the ERISA lawyers are trying to clarify that, and we're working with many in the meantime. But I think the net effect for us is to have some kind of standardized pricing. We -- obviously, we don't want to have 100 different pricing structures out there and are trying to come to some new standard that works for most of our -- most broker-dealers and advisers, and that's really where we are."

I think the big one for us that, as I stated before, that tends to snap back the fastest is the Franklin Income Fund, which you look at that category just 2 quarters ago, we had a hybrid $5.6 billion in net redemptions and last quarter, $2.2 billion. So I think that, that trend, we hope, will continue as people the -- even in the last quarter, the 3-year number or the 5-year number actually improved to back to the second quartile. And hopefully in another -- the end of this month, hopefully, we'll be back in the second quartile for the 1 year. And as we stated earlier, we're at the 8th percentile for year-to-date. So that's a pretty big recovery there, and I think that that's where you'll see the improvement flows. I think we have some good stories as well on the equity side with one of our largest funds, a Franklin Rising Dividend fund, a $17 billion, $18 billion fund doing extremely well right now and getting a lot of attention for its performance, which is first quartile for the 1 year, 3 -- second quartile for 3 and 5.

I think they're -- the main driver when we talked about a platform change was one of our large broker-dealers that we worked with building an in-house sub-advice platform and was moving some assets, and it was $1.1 billion out of our mutual discovery fund.

We did have -- I think the other one on the -- just in general, I talked about the variable annuity business and how that's undergoing change. And certainly, with the DOL, we'll have more changes. But we have seen some groups get out of that business so they're really in a wind-down. So it kind of changes what they're looking for on their platform. And we, with our solutions group, we're doing our best to transition those assets. But they're the ones that still you have a pipeline of redemptions over the next, say, 2 years as those groups are transitioning out of that business. So I would guesstimate that you probably have $5 billion-plus in assets over the next 2 years that will transition. Hopefully, we can capture some of that, but it will go out of the traditional funds into a lower fee type solution to meet whatever liability they have. So those would be the big changes that have driven the lumpier redemptions, and I think we'll continue to create some headwinds in the next 2 years on the VA side."

So that doesn't seem like an attractive alternative. I think we also believe that active -- that there are forces at work over the last 5, 10 years that have contributed to the passive strategies. And once active outperforms and that tends to be in a more of a rising rate environment, historically, I think that conventional wisdom could shift pretty quickly, and that's something we firmly believe. But in the meantime, we have built out our solutions. We're looking at our multi-asset capabilities. We're getting a lot of interest in that, and that's just another area how we can add value to investors by combining different asset classes over time. So that's going to be an important growth area.

And because this fund -- just to benchmark it against global bonds, I think, is not -- it really is more of a global macro-type fund, and it doesn't fit really well into any one given category. I think the standpoint of diversifying from local currency and local sovereign debt, there is still a big appetite for that. I don't think that's changed. And I think also when people -- sophisticated investors look at the portfolio and look how it's positioned, it is very different. It does offer something very different, and that it will be one of the few games in town if rates actually do go up at some point. And I think the risk certainly from the perspective of an individual country's currency depreciating, in some cases, is still very much there. So we are getting institutional interest, and that really hasn't changed. So hopefully, we'll get some significant wins in there."

And hopefully, at some level, you'll get some efficiencies out of that as we get better at providing useful information on a realtime basis through digital side, which has been a big emphasis in trying to reach more advisers in a more efficient way.

I have been struck by not only the fact that your company is having very stable, not growing, but very stable fixed income growth sales and so were many of your competitors. It's surprising to me given that there is no yield and that -- and the duration risk is very substantial should interest rates rise over the next couple of years.

But at the end of the day, it's very hard to take a portfolio and just ignore fixed income. It -- you'd put a lot more risk into that given portfolio if you go 100% equities. But at the end of the day, you look at something like munis. It still has an attractive yield relative to the treasury market, certainly on an after-tax basis. And the general consensus right now, right or wrong, is that rates are not going up. So I think there's a sense of security that even in these -- with these small yields, they're going to be fine for X number of years."

And we're here to provide our commentary on third quarter results. As a quick reminder, our 10-Q was also filed this morning and additional details on results can be found there. The June quarter was challenging for the industry as the introduction of new regulations by the Department of Labor and the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union led to increased uncertainty. 
On the positive side, we are seeing encouraging developments on the investment performance front where we saw improvements across all major categories over the trailing 1-year period. Equity and hybrid fund performance improved across 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. We continue to experience net outflows that we did see an improvement in flows from nearly all investment objectives as redemptions have steadily declined over the past several quarters.
Financial results were solid with operating income of almost $600 million and 11% increase from Q2. We also continue to demonstrate strong capital management as we repurchased an additional 9 million shares in the quarter, bringing our fiscal year to date repurchases to over 29 million. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares to ensure we have the flexibility to execute our capital management strategy going forward.
This quarter also marked an exciting milestone for us, the introduction of Franklin LibertyShares, a new exchange traded fund platform. In June, we launched our first suite of strategic beta ETFs under the name Liberty Q. The new suite includes 3 multifactor core portfolio funds and one with a dividend focus. This launch was supported by a significant marketing push demonstrating our commitment to this new initiative. We continue to build out our ETF team and plan to launch additional funds in the months ahead, including some active strategies.
Turning to aggregate long-term performance on Slide 6, I'm encouraged by our improved relative performance across equity and hybrid funds, most notably, Franklin Income Fund had another strong quarter with year-to-date relative performance ranking in the 8th percentile driven by positive returns across asset classes and sectors, but most notably, by the recent recovery in energy markets. As of quarter-end relative performance for the 1- and 3-year periods were still below the peer average, but 5-year performance has recovered to the top 2 quartiles. Performance in July continues to be strong and trailing 1-year performance against its Morningstar and Lipper peers was nearly in the top quartile again. We've also seen a strong rebound in performance of Franklin Rising Dividends Fund, which now ranks in the top 2 quartiles across all time periods and contributed to an improved 3-year number.
Fixed income performance remained solid for the 5- and 10-year periods, however, near-term performance softened a bit. The primary driver of bond performance rankings remains our global strategies, which were negatively impacted by our relatively short duration and certain currency position specifically their net short position in the end, which has rebounded nicely in July. Assets under management ended the quarter at $732 billion as was previously disclosed. Monthly average assets increased a bit. However, daily average assets actually increased 1.5%. Our asset mix remain stable with a near 50-50 split between equities and bonds. We assume a similar split in hybrid assets though our mix clearly skews towards global.
From a sales region perspective, we remain roughly 2/3 U.S., 1/3 international. It's worth reiterating that our sales region disclosure represents where the sale occurred, not the investment strategy, nor where the products are managed or domiciled.
There have been a number of questions on the potential impacts of the Brexit vote on our business and while much remains unknown, we do not believe it will have a major impact on the way our firm operates in the U.K. or the services we provide to our customers there. Furthermore, we have other regulated subsidiaries across continental Europe should there be future restrictions on cross-border trade and financial products and services between the U.K. and Continental Europe. Currently, we do not anticipate any significant impact to the distribution of our funds because our flagship cross-border fund vehicle is a Luxembourg domiciled CCAD range, which is distributed in 39 countries worldwide including the U.K. and Continental Europe. Our U.K.-based open-end investment company ranges targeted to U.K. investors only and is not passported into the EU. If in the future, European clients wish or need to contract a management company based in the new EU, we already have the regulated entities to service our need there. We've heard a number of concerns over the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule and the strength of our business in the broker dealer channel, as well as the amount of assets under management currently in Class A shares. We believe this has led to some notable misunderstandings.
We've been successful over the past 65 years because we work hard to develop strong relationships with the clients who trust our track record with the brand we built neither of which will be affected by this rule. Product structure and pricing has been evolving for decades, and we're confident that we can continue to evolve with it. We are actively engaged with all of our primary clients and partners to understand the impact of this rule, which will be different for each firm so it's not possible to generalize on the impact of the rule for the industry or for us at this time. Not only will each of our partners pursue the most appropriate response to the rule for their own business, but that decision will have very different impacts on our business because of the nature of our relationship with each partner bearings.
Looking at the component changes and assets under management, long-term net new outflows improved this quarter and were $19.2 billion as redemptions dropped at the lowest level since the second quarter of 2013. Market appreciation of $10 billion partially offset the impact of outflows this quarter. While ongoing volatility, concerns over energy prices and performance challenges continue to negatively impact our retail business, we are encouraged by the continued decline in redemptions in both the U.S. and internationally. While overall sales remain under pressure, international retail sales increased for the first time since the second quarter of 2014. Global equity outflows increased to about $8 billion this quarter due to a $1.7 billion institutional redemption from our Canadian business. Some of our retail global equity funds also saw increased redemption activity this quarter as a platform changed by one of our key distributors resulted in a $1 billion redemption from the mutual global discovery fund. Global fixed income redemptions declined for the U.S. and cross-border versions of the Templeton global bond and total return funds leading to net outflows of about $7 billion for the quarter.
However, sales have not yet rebounded due to short-term performance challenges. We've been working hard to communicate the global macro team's positioning and strategy via the new global macro shifts hub, which serves as an educational resource for investors and fits more broadly into our What's Next for bond markets marketing campaign.
We saw a rebound in U.S. equity sales this quarter, led by Franklin utilities and Franklin Biotech Funds, which reduced net outflows to $1.6 billion. Hybrid net outflows improved again this quarter. The key driver of hybrid flows remains Franklin Income Fund, which has seen redemptions eased and a modest rebound in sales since February. Improving sales and redemption trends, along with net exchanges back into the fund over the past 4 months have yielded a significant reduction in monthly net outflows from the fund. Sustained performance and a rebound of the net asset value should support a rebound in sales.
Tax-free fixed income was a clear positive in the quarter with about $400 million in net inflows. Performance of our larger tax refunds has been good. And we're seeing increased interest in the asset class with a number of our funds in positive territory. U.S. taxable fixed income remains under pressure with $1.6 billion in outflows driven by net redemptions from several high-yield funds, but to the positive redemptions declined again this quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken for financial results."
28703,373871223,1016646,"Franklin Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg. Third quarter financial results were strong as we started to see prior quarters cost saving initiatives reflected in the results. Compared to the prior quarter, operating income increased 11% to $595 million and net income increased to $4",554,"Thank you, Greg. Third quarter financial results were strong as we started to see prior quarters cost saving initiatives reflected in the results. Compared to the prior quarter, operating income increased 11% to $595 million and net income increased to $446 million. Earnings per share of $0.77 was a 26% increase from last quarter and 2% ahead of net income growth due to the lower share count.
Total revenues of $1.6 billion were slightly higher the last quarter. Investment management fees were essentially flat compared with the second quarter as the impact of higher daily average assets under management was offset by lower performance fees. Excluding performance fees of $1.5 million, the effective fee rate base on the daily average assets under management was unchanged. Sales and distribution fees were $450 million reflecting increased commissionable sales from our U.S. and cross-border funds and increased asset base fees in the U.S. 
Shareholders service fees were flat while higher consolidated sponsored investment product revenue led to the increase in other revenue.
Operating expenses decreased 4%, with the most expense categories flat or down with exception of sales, distribution and marketing expense, which was higher due to increases in related revenue, as well as adjustments impacting the amortization of deferred sales commissions.
Compensation expense decreased by nearly $50 million due to lower severance costs this quarter as well as other factors such as lower payroll taxes and other variable expenses due in part to lower headcount. IT and occupancy expense were relatively flat and general and administrative expense decreased to $75 million with most of the variance related to the prior quarters intangible asset impairment and the mark-to-market of the contingent liability.
Looking at Slide 19, the decrease in expenses edge the fiscal year-to-date operating margin up to 35.7% and the tax rate for the quarter was 29% as our projected rate for the fiscal year decreased 120 basis points. This decrease was largely due to a change in estimated earnings mix to lower tax jurisdictions. Assuming a similar mix in the fourth quarter, we currently anticipate a fiscal year tax rate of around 31%. Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interests was $68 million, an increase of more than $50 million since of the second quarter due to a number of factors that illustrated on Slide 20 and described in more detail in our 10-Q.
Turning to capital management. As Greg mentioned, we repurchased 9.3 million shares during the quarter, taking advantage of lower prices in June, more so than in the first 2 months of the quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date period, we repurchased 29.4 million shares or about 5% of shares outstanding. This represented virtually all of the additional shares authorized for the repurchase back in October so our board authorized an additional 50 million shares at their most recent meeting in June. When we announced the share repurchase authorization, we saw a number of conclusions drawn from that announcement, and I just want to clarify that it did not reflect a change in our capital management approach or our priorities. Combined with dividends, the trailing 12 months payout was $2 billion, representing a total payout ratio that once again exceeded 100%.
And that concludes our comments on this quarter's results. We look forward to speaking with you on the call later today."

In addition to Ken Lewis and myself, we have Tom Regner with us today. And Tom is the Head of our U.S. Advisory Services, responsible for both the retail and institutional business in the U.S.
Fiscal 2016 was challenging in many respects as performance headwinds led to elevated outflows, but expense management and capital return were clearly positive. I'm encouraged by improving performance trends with several flagship funds. As I mentioned in my comments this morning, Franklin Income Fund was ranked in the top decile of its peer group on a 1-year basis, and we saw improvements in all major asset classes over all primary time frames this quarter. 
Furthermore, the Global Bond Fund has had significant outperformance in the month of October month-to-date, returning over 5% through the 25th, beating its benchmark by over 800 basis points and its peer group by more than 600 basis points.

I mean, I think it's tough to really estimate what effect it could have on sales, but I think it clearly has been very disruptive to the advisers business right now in sorting out what is going to happen. I think from the last call, we continue to make a lot of progress, a lot of work being done on getting ready for April. I think the good news is that there seems -- our concern has always been that it's not workable to come out with a different pricing structure for every broker-dealer out there, and we seem to be narrowing those options down to, hopefully, two. And then you saw the recent announcement around a clean share class or superclass [ph] or whatever you want to call them and having more of a stripped-down version available at some point in the future. That could be an option as well where you have the pricing handled at the broker-dealer level. All of that, I think, is happening. The question about what effect will it have, I think the net effect -- there were some surveys done. It said -- one said that you'll have 10% to 15% less advisers out there. I think that some would retire. The transition is going to be very difficult to go to the new model. So I think that, that can be disruptive as well. And I just think overall, our sense is once we get past this, you'll get to a more normalized environment. But right now, it is very disruptive force for the adviser. And I'll ask Tom Regner who's been involved more day to day if he has anything to add there."

Those are the debates we're having internally now. That could create some efficiencies. But I think from a cost side this is a business that every basis point is going to matter. And I think the good news on some outcomes on DOLs are going to have a lower front and sales charge that will help with some of the relative rankings. And I think as we said in our announcement at MorningStar is now the a shares is not going to be used most of it is done net net asset value and that's going to make us more competitive where we see a lot of our funds will increase star rating.

So I think size matters quite a bit as far as continuing to get shelf space in the new model.

And as you're having discussions with distribution partners, are you seeing any of those partners actually have an impact in the current iterations and in the prep with the current rule on assets beyond just retirement accounts?"

That's one of the reasons that we launched our strategic beta lineup you have to play in more of an active space with -- within the retail business. What we're seeing from advisers is, frankly, there's a lot of confusion because a lot of advisers have built a commission-based business, and that's why are selling 8 product to a client. Now they're being looked at as having they're being required to build portfolios. That's a very different business model. That's a very different skill set. So we're working -- again, we're doing extensive training internally to be able to work with advisers to help them with that. And as Greg pointed out, we started building out our investment platform team, gosh, 7, 8 years ago because the platforms, if you will, the gate research, gatekeepers become even more important, more powerful going forward. So we're working on it from both ends. And I do note just attending meetings, summer meetings with our clients that they've been working on this for quite some time. And we are not standing still.

It was exactly the question I had to our group early this morning. When I was going through some of the numbers, I thought that stood out on hybrid growth, and there are some other parts of that number because actually, the Franklin Income Fund, its growth sales were exactly level quarter-over-quarter despite the number of hybrid declining. It had almost exactly the same level of growth, and that's the key driver some other parts in that. I mean K2 falls into the hybrid category, and that had a little bit of a drop-off quarter-over-quarter, so that contributed to the gross number dropping down. But I think we are very optimistic that, that fund should continue to be a strong driver of our flows in this kind of environment. And I think it takes a little bit of time for people realize that it's back in the top decile for the 1 year and you have a lag effect of energy prices and what that did to a lot of our funds. And I look up across the lineup, and I'm very encouraged right now. I think we talked about it in the past as the value the value discipline you tend to get more energy exposure and then sometimes the market, and a lot of that has come back along with materials and whether it's our high-yield area of the income fund area and the hybrid Templeton area and Mutual Series, all of our rising dividend funds, all those funds now are performing very well. So I hope that we will get some momentum back now on the strong 1 year numbers. And actually, our hybrid and equity assets, 75% of them are in the top 2 quartiles for the 1 year.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our commentary on our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. This was a challenging year in many respects, however, I'm pleased to",1325,"Hello, and good morning. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our commentary on our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. 
This was a challenging year in many respects, however, I'm pleased to see that investment performance broadly improved over the course of the year and we made significant progress on our most important strategic initiatives. Improved investment performance has clearly helped to slow redemptions, which were down almost 25% from last year. We did see a modest improvement in international retail flows, but that was offset by some institutional redemptions as well as improved U.S. fixed income flows. 
Financial results were solid, with operating income of $2.4 billion on a 36% operating margin. On the capital management side, we returned over $1.7 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases, representing more than 100% of net income. For the year, we purchased 36.6 million shares, decreasing shares outstanding by 5.5% on a net basis.
Understandably, the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule has triggered a number of questions from investors, and while it's clear that the rule will greatly impact the financial services firms, I want to assure everyone that we are working closely with our distribution partners to ensure our firm is well positioned once the rule takes effect. 
Many brokers dealers are choosing to apply the best interest contract exemption allowed under the rule, while also building new mutual fund programs to offer levelized pricing and compensation. The industry is moving in the direction of 2 general product types. The first is a more traditional share class structure, with a lower commission and standardized 12B 1 piece, while the second will have more of a transaction-based fee structure. 
There's still a lot of work to be done, but introducing new share classes and responding to evolving regulations is nothing new to us.
Overall, our investment team has continued to deliver solid, long-term performance and importantly we see relative performance improved in several key areas over the last year. Franklin Income Fund, our largest fund by asset, outperformed its benchmark for the year and was a top decile performer in its peer group. Other key funds such as Franklin Rising Dividends, with its focus on dividend growth; and Templeton Foreign, an international equity strategy, experienced very strong rebounds in absolute and relative performance, beating their benchmarks and delivering top quartile relative performance. 
Another positive development on the performance front is the enhancement of Morningstar's making in its rating methodology. Among other changes, Morningstar is removing load adjustments that previously assumed a maximum fee for load investors, even though most investors don't pay any sales charge in an A share class. This change will level out the playing field between share classes and better reflect current state of the industry. 
At the industry level, most funds are expected to keep their current star rating. However, we estimate that nearly 1/3 of our Class A shares will see an increase of 1 star, including key funds like Templeton Global Bond and Franklin Rising Dividends. Assets under management were essentially flat compared to last quarter as we continue to benefit from a diversified mix of assets under management. Long-term outflows continue, while sales were flat this quarter, redemptions increased somewhat, leading to outflows of $22 billion but market appreciation of $22 billion offset the impact of flows for the quarter. 
From a retail perspective, redemptions have been improving since the fourth quarter of last year on the back of improving performance. Sales, overall, continued to be challenged as advisers remain cautious, given the ongoing volatility, historical performance challenges and the upcoming implementation of the DOL rule in the U.S. Consequently, large outflows continue from certain flagship funds. We did, however, see international retail sales improve again this quarter, driven by a pick up in demand from clients in Asia and parts in Europe for range of strategies.
While it may take some time given current economic conditions and market valuations, we remain confident that demand for flagship products will recover as advisers and clients are utilizing a wait and see approach to determine if there's consistency and improved performance.
In the meantime, we continue to keep advisers informed about the current positioning of our portfolios and the prospective behind the portfolio managers' predictions. Our variable annuity business, which is included in U.S. retail flows has been under pressure for that past 2 years as some of our insurance partners exited the business. While others made a shift to passive. Those decisions led to cumulative net outflows of $13 billion since the fourth quarter of last year, including $1 billion this quarter from our variable insurance product and self-advised funds. Those flows have impacted nearly all investment objectives and are illustrated in the flow graphs by investment objective. 
We wanted to provide some additional clarity and background on flows from this business because we expect an additional $2.6 billion of redemption to hit this quarter with most of that expected in October and an additional $4.8 billion to be redeemed in the second quarter. This remains an important business for the company, and we believe that we are now better positioned to meet the evolving asset allocation needs of our insurance partners.
Looking now at flows by investment objective for the quarter. Overall flows into our global strategies remain challenge as redemptions were elevated. However, sales held up and were essentially flat. On the global equity side, a large institutional redemption of about $1.5 billion from an emerging markets strategy increased net outflows as did retail outflows from the U.S. versions of mutual global discovery and Templeton Global Funds. As of quarter end, Templeton Global Bond and Templeton Global Total Return Fund underperformed on an absolute and relative basis due to currency positions, which offset the impact of interest rates strategies and the mutual impact of sovereign credit exposures. As a result, we continue to see net outflows in global fixed income from our retail clients.
Our global macro team believes that a return to a more normalized monetary policy in the U.S. has the potential to catalyze global markets towards a broad fundamental recovery.
The strengthening U.S. economy, along with rising U.S. Treasury yields would magnify the fundamental differences between healthy and vulnerable economies, leading to respective appreciations and depreciations against the U.S. dollar. These events could be significant catalysts for improved performance on our global fixed income strategies. In fact, over the past month through October, the Global Bond Fund recaptured a sizable portion of its year-to-date underperformance due to its currency positions and a slight rise in rates. 
U.S. equity redemptions increased this quarter, which was consistent with the industry leading to net outflows of almost $3 billion for the category. Looking at hybrid flows, we've seen an uptick in sales from Q1 into the Franklin Income Fund due to sustained performance improvements, and the fund has been our highest gross selling product for 7 months in a row. 
While sales have been fairly flat for the past 3 quarters, we've also seen a consistent slowdown of redemptions leading to improved net flows for this fund, although hybrid products remain net outflows overall. 
U.S. fixed income was a clear positive story for us this quarter. Good performance and attractive yields in our tax-free income products, combined with the strong brand and long-standing history in the bond market has generated increased demand for these products in recent quarter, leading to strong sales and net inflows of $600 million for the quarter. Majority of that has been on our California bond funds with a number of them finishing in the top 10 for net flows. 
The U.S. taxable funds, while not quite in positive territory, continue their upward trajectory with the significant increase in sales and a decrease in redemptions this quarter. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Ken to discuss operating results."

The financial results for the year reflected some of the challenges that Greg mentioned, but remains solid. Operating income for the year was a strong $2.4 billion. This was due in part to a number of cost management initiatives that resulted in sales and distribution expense savings, inclusive of implementation costs of more than 5%. This exceeded the cost savings projections I provided last quarter because we decided not to secure the assets and liabilities of a closed pension fund in Europe. 
In light of the changing economic climate in Europe, it no longer made economic sense to pursue that course of action.
Net income was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 15%, and earnings per share was $2.94, a decrease of only 11% due to a 5% decrease in shares outstanding. Focusing on the fourth quarter, on Slide 15, operating income was almost $580 million, a slight decrease of 3% from the third quarter. Net income was $472 million and earnings per share was $0.82.
Investment management fees increased slightly, reflecting a similar increase in daily average assets under management from last quarter. Excluding performance of these of $3.3 million, the effective fee rate, based on daily average assets under management, was down slightly, offsetting the additional day in the quarter.
Sales and distribution fees decreased to $441 million as a modest increase in asset-based fees were more than offset by lower U.S. commissionable sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $58 million, a 5% decrease from last quarter, due mostly to lower billable accounts following the annual purge of closed accounts in the U.S. during the quarter.
Operating expenses declined 1% as seasonal increase in several expense categories offset lower compensation and sales and distribution expenses.
Compensation and benefits expense was $317 million, a decrease of almost $10 million due to lower severance and payroll taxes in the current quarter. IT, occupancy and general and administrative expenses all experienced a seasonal increase, as typical of the fourth quarter.
Looking towards fiscal 2017, based on the current revenue environment, we are budgeting for non-sales and distribution expenses to be flat to down a couple percent compared with 2016.
We recognize that we cannot cut our way to growth and plan to invest some of last year's cost reductions into growth initiatives, including extending our ETF platform and new product launches as well as new technology. That of course means, from a modeling perspective, we are budgeting for technology expense to increase.
As illustrated on Slide 18, the decline in average assets under management led to a lower but still very strong operating margin of 35.7% for the year. The fiscal year tax rate came in about 150 basis points lower than anticipated at 29.7% in rough terms. About half of this was attributable to discrete items, but the rest reflecting earnings mix.
We're currently forecasting the fiscal year 2017 tax rate to be around 31.5%, with the relative mix of U.S. earnings to that of lower tax jurisdictions expected to push the rate up or down. 
Investment in other income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $65 million, more or less flat compared to the prior quarter with most of the gains coming from equity method investments.
Turning to capital management. We repurchased an additional 7.2 million shares during the quarter at a total cost of $256 million. This brought total repurchases for the year to 36.6 million shares at a total cost of $1.3 billion.
Combined with dividends, the fiscal year payout was over $1.7 billion, representing a total payout ratio of over 100% of net income. This exceeds U.S. earnings and resulted in a $500 million decrease in U.S. net cash and investments since last year. 
This concludes our comments on the quarter's results. Looking forward to speaking with you on the call later today."

There's still a lot of work to be done, but introducing new share classes and responding to evolving regulations is nothing new to us.
Overall, our investment teams continue to deliver solid, long-term performance and importantly, we've seen relative performance improve in several key areas over the last year. Franklin Income Fund, our largest fund by assets, outperformed its benchmark for the year and was a top-decile performer against its peer group. Other key funds such as Franklin Rising Dividends, with its focus on dividend growth; and Templeton Foreign, an international equity strategy, experienced very strong rebounds in absolute and relative performance, beating their benchmarks and delivering top quartile relative performance.
Another positive development on the performance front is the enhancements that Morningstar is making in its rating methodology. Among other changes, Morningstar is removing load adjustments that previously assumed the maximum fee for load investors, even though most investors don't pay any sales charge in an A share class. This change will level out the playing field between share classes and better reflect current state of the industry. At the industry level, most funds are expected to keep their current star rating. However, we estimate that nearly 1/3 of our Class A shares will see an increase of 1 star, including key funds like Templeton Global Bond and Franklin Rising Dividend.
Assets under management were essentially flat compared to last quarter as we continue to benefit from a diversified mix of assets under management. Long-term outflows continue. While sales were flat this quarter, redemptions increased somewhat, leading to outflows of $22 billion, but market appreciation of $24 billion offset the impact of flows for the quarter.
From a retail perspective, redemptions have been improving since the fourth quarter of last year on the back of improving performance. Sales overall continue to be challenged as advisers remain cautious given the ongoing volatility, historical performance challenges and the upcoming implementation of the DOL rule in the U.S. Consequently, large outflows continue from certain flagship funds. We did, however, see international retail sales improve again this quarter, driven by a pickup in demand from clients in Asia and parts of Europe for a range of strategies.
While it may take some time given current economic conditions and market valuations, we remain confident that demand for our flagship products will recover as advisers and clients are utilizing a wait-and-see approach to determine if there's a consistency in improved performance.
In the meantime, we continue to keep advisers informed about the current positioning of our portfolios and the perspective behind the portfolio manager's convictions. Our variable annuity business, which is included in U.S. retail flows, has been under pressure for the past 2 years as some of our insurance partners exited the business, while others made a shift to passive. Those decisions led to cumulative net outflows of $13 billion since the fourth quarter of last year, including $1 billion this quarter from our variable insurance product and sub-advised funds. Those flows have impacted nearly all investment objectives and are illustrated in the flow graphs by investment objective.
We wanted to provide some additional clarity and background on flows from this business because we expect an additional $2.6 billion of redemptions to hit this quarter, with most of that expected in October and an additional $4.8 billion to be redeemed in the second quarter. This remains an important business for the company, and we believe that we are now better positioned to meet the evolving asset allocation needs of our insurance partners.
Looking now at flows by investment objective for the quarter. Overall flows into our global strategies remain challenged as redemptions were elevated. However, sales held up and were essentially flat. On the global equity side, a large institutional redemption of about $1.5 billion from an emerging market strategy increased net outflows as did retail outflows from the U.S. versions of Mutual Global Discovery and Templeton Growth Funds. As of quarter end, Templeton Global Bond and Templeton Global Total Return Funds underperformed on an absolute and relative basis due to currency positions, which offset the impact of interest rate strategies and the neutral impact of sovereign credit exposures. As a result, we continue to see net outflows in global fixed income from our retail clients.
Our global macro team believes that a return to a more normalized monetary policy in the U.S. has the potential to catalyze global markets towards a broad fundamental recovery.
The strengthening U.S. economy, along with rising U.S. Treasury yields would magnify the fundamental differences between healthy and vulnerable economies, leading to respective appreciations and depreciations against the U.S. dollar. These events could be significant catalysts for improved performance on our global fixed income strategies. In fact, over the past month through October, the Global Bond Fund recaptured a sizable portion of its year-to-date underperformance due to its currency positions and a slight rise in rates.
U.S. equity redemptions increased this quarter, which was consistent with the industry, leading to net outflows of almost $3 billion for the category. Looking at hybrid flows, we've seen an uptick in sales from Q1 into the Franklin Income Fund due to sustained performance improvements, and the fund has been the firm's highest gross selling product for 7 months in a row. While sales have been fairly flat for the past 3 quarters, we've also seen a consistent slowdown of redemptions, leading to improved net flows for this fund, although hybrid products remain in net outflows overall.
U.S. fixed income was a clear positive story for us this quarter. Good performance and attractive yields in our tax-free income products, combined with a strong brand and long-standing history in the municipal bond market, has generated increased demand for these products in recent quarters, leading to strong sales and net inflows of $600 million for the quarter. Majority of that has been in our California bond funds, with a number of them finishing in the top 10 for net flows.
The U.S. taxable funds, while not quite in positive territory, continue their upward trajectory with a significant increase in sales and a decrease in redemptions this quarter.
I'd now like to turn it over to Ken to discuss operating results."

The financial results for the year reflected some of the challenges that Greg mentioned, but remained solid. Operating income for the year was a strong $2.4 billion.

The financial results for the year reflected some of the challenges that Greg mentioned, but remained solid. Operating income for the year was a strong $2.4 billion. This was due in part to a number of cost management initiatives that resulted in non-sales and distribution expense savings, inclusive of implementation cost of more than 5%. This exceeded the cost savings projections I provided last quarter because we decided not to secure the assets and liabilities of a closed pension plan in Europe. In light of the changing economic climate in Europe, it no longer made economic sense to pursue that course of action.
Net income was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 15%. And earnings per share was $2.94, a decrease of only 11% due to a 5% decrease in shares outstanding. Focusing on the fourth quarter, on Slide 15, operating income was almost $580 million, a slight decrease of 3% from the third quarter. Net income was $472 million and earnings per share was $0.82.
Investment management fees increased slightly, reflecting a similar increase in daily average assets under management from last quarter. Excluding performance fees of $3.3 million, the effective fee rate based on daily average assets under management was down slightly, offsetting the additional day in the quarter.
Sales and distribution fees decreased to $441 million as the modest increase in asset-based fees were more than offset by lower U.S. commissionable sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $58 million, a 5% decrease from last quarter, due mostly to lower billable accounts following the annual purge of closed accounts in the U.S. during the quarter.
Operating expenses declined 1% as seasonal increase in several expense categories offset lower compensation and sales and distribution expenses.
Compensation and benefits expense was $317 million, a decrease of almost $10 million due to lower severance and payroll taxes in the current quarter. IT, occupancy and general and administrative expenses all experienced a seasonal increase as typical of the fourth quarter.
Looking towards fiscal 2017, based on the current revenue environment, we're budgeting for non-sales and distribution expenses to be flat to down a couple percent compared with 2016.
We recognize that we cannot cut our way to growth and plan to invest some of last year's cost reductions into growth initiatives, including expanding our ETF platform and new product launches as well as new technology. That, of course, means from a modeling perspective, we are budgeting for technology expense to increase.
As illustrated on Slide 18, the decline in average assets under management led to a lower though still very strong operating margin of 35.7% for the year. The fiscal year tax rate came in about 150 basis points lower than anticipated at 29.7% in rough terms. About half of this was attributable to discrete items, with the rest reflecting earnings mix.
We're currently forecasting the fiscal year 2017 tax rate to be around 31.5%, with the relative mix of U.S. earnings to that of lower tax jurisdictions expected to push the rate up or down.
Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interest was $65 million, more or less flat compared to the prior quarter, with most of the gains coming from equity method investments.
Turning to capital management. We repurchased an additional 7.2 million shares during the quarter at a total cost of $256 million. This brought total repurchases for the year to 36.6 million shares at a total cost of $1.3 billion.
Combined with dividends, the fiscal year payout was over $1.7 billion, representing a total payout ratio of over 100% of net income. This exceeds U.S. earnings and resulted in a $500 million decrease in U.S. net cash and investments since last year.
This concludes our comments on the quarter's results, looking forward to speaking with you on the call later today."

Fiscal 2016 was challenging in many respects as performance headwinds led to elevated outflows, but expense management and capital return were clearly positive. I'm encouraged by improving performance trends with several flagship funds. As I mentioned in my comments this morning, Franklin Income Fund was ranked in the top decile of its peer group on a 1-year basis, and we saw improvements in all major asset classes over all primary time frames this quarter. 
Furthermore, the Global Bond Fund has had significant outperformance in the month of October month-to-date, returning over 5% through the 25th, beating its benchmark by over 800 basis points and its peer group by more than 600 basis points.

I think from the last call, we continue to make a lot of progress, a lot of work being done on getting ready for April. I think the good news is that there seems -- our concern has always been that it's not workable to come out with a different pricing structure for every broker-dealer out there, and we seem to be narrowing those options down to, hopefully, two. And then you saw the recent announcement around a clean share class or super-class or whatever you want to call them and having more of a stripped-down version available at some point in the future. That could be an option as well where you have the pricing handled at the broker-dealer level. All of that, I think, is happening. The question about what effect will it have, I think the net effect -- there were some surveys done. It said -- one said that you'll have 10% to 15% less advisers out there. I think that some would retire. The transition is going to be very difficult to go to the new model. So I think that, that can be disruptive as well. And I just think overall, our sense is once we get past this, you'll get to a more normalized environment. But right now, it is very disruptive force for the adviser. And I'll ask Tom Regner who's been involved more day to day if he has anything to add there."

I think the question around your product lineup, and it's something that maybe Ken touched on a little bit on just where do we see potential savings in streamlining and what is DOL, I think it, probably for us, pushes us further down that path of trying to simplify the lineup and rationalize funds that may -- in a post-DOL world, may not fit neatly into more of an advisory model versus a traditional brokerage model. Those are the debates we're having internally now, and that could create some efficiencies. But I think from a cost side, this is a business that every basis point is going to matter. And I think the good news on some outcomes from the DOL is you're going to have a lower front-end sales charge that will help with some of your relative rankings. And then as we said, and I think in our announcement at Morningstar, it's now the A shares is not going to use those maximum charge because most of it's done at a net asset value. And that's going to make us more competitive where we see a lot of our funds will increase its star rating. So I think those are very positive outcomes, and I think our concern of having 35 share classes at least now where we feel like we'll only have to add a few."

I think the advantage of the transition, it's like a funnel where there's going to be less funds available in the new model. But if you have large assets, the probability of your fund being included, even in a period of underperformance, it's highly unlikely that it's going to be eliminated from that lineup. So I think size matters quite a bit as far as continuing to get shelf space in the new model. But it is higher from a retention standpoint than your traditional brokerage model where it's more a one-on-one relationship. Here, it's more of a gatekeeper-, consultant-driven, more institutional-type relationship.

What we're seeing from advisers is, frankly, there's a lot of confusion because a lot of advisers have built a commission-based business, and that's where you're selling 8 products to a client. Now they're being looked at as having they're being required to build portfolios. That's a very different business model. That's a very different skill set. So we're working -- again, we're doing an extensive training internally to be able to work with advisers to help them with that.

I -- it was exactly the question I had to our group early this morning. When I was, like, going through some of the numbers, I thought that, that stood out on hybrid growth dropping, and there are some other moving parts in that number. Because actually, the Franklin Income Fund, its gross sales were exactly level quarter-over-quarter despite the number of hybrid declining. It had almost exactly the same level of gross, and that's the key driver with some other parts in that. I mean, K2 falls into the hybrid category, and that had a little bit of a drop-off quarter-over-quarter. So that contributed to the gross number dropping down. But I think it -- we are very optimistic that, that fund should continue to be a strong driver of our flows in this kind of environment. And I think it takes a little bit of time for people to realize that it's back in the top decile for the 1 year, and you have a lag effect of energy prices and what that did to a lot of our funds. And I look at across the lineup, and I'm very encouraged right now. I think we talked about it in the past as the value. With the value discipline, you tend to get more energy exposure than sometimes the market. And a lot of that has come back, along with materials, and whether it's our high-yield area, the income fund area and hybrid Templeton area and mutual series, all of our rising dividend funds, all those funds now are performing very well. So I would hope that we will get some momentum back now on the strong 1-year numbers. And actually, our hybrid and equity assets, 75% of them are in the top 2 quartiles for the 1 year.

I think you're never going to beat passive on price if the consensus view like it is today that passive will outperform. That's not a view I share. And I think in the next decade, I think active will very well. And then if you outperform the passive, pricing becomes less of an issue. But I think the world is overly focused today strictly on price and isn't really looking at anything else. And I think that will change as well. But again as I've said before, I think any industry that's slower growth and has a lot of managers out there, there's going to be continued pressure on pricing. But an active manager, you're not -- if the consensus view is passive as a way to go, you're not going to increase your business by cutting your fees in half, which is just not going to get there."

Fiscal 2016 was challenging in many respects as performance headwinds led to elevated outflows, but expense management and capital return were clearly positive. I'm encouraged by improving performance trends with several flagship funds. As I mentioned in my comments this morning, Franklin Income Fund was ranked in the top decile of its peer group on a 1-year basis, and we saw improvements in all major asset classes over all primary time frames this quarter. 
Furthermore, the Global Bond Fund has had significant outperformance in the month of October month-to-date, returning over 5% through the 25th, beating its benchmark by over 800 basis points and its peer group by more than 600 basis points.

I mean, I think it's tough to really estimate what effect it could have on sales, but I think it clearly has been very disruptive to the advisers business right now in sorting out what is going to happen. I think from the last call, we continue to make a lot of progress, a lot of work being done on getting ready for April. I think the good news is that there seems -- our concern has always been that it's not workable to come out with a different pricing structure for every broker-dealer out there, and we seem to be narrowing those options down to, hopefully, two. And then you saw the recent announcement around a clean share class or super-class or whatever you want to call them and having more of a stripped-down version available at some point in the future. That could be an option as well where you have the pricing handled at the broker-dealer level. All of that, I think, is happening. The question about what effect will it have, I think the net effect -- there were some surveys done. It said -- one said that you'll have 10% to 15% less advisers out there. I think that some would retire. The transition is going to be very difficult to go to the new model. So I think that, that can be disruptive as well. And I just think overall, our sense is once we get past this, you'll get to a more normalized environment. But right now, it is very disruptive force for the adviser. And I'll ask Tom Regner who's been involved more day to day if he has anything to add there."

I think the question around your product lineup, and it's something that maybe Ken touched on a little bit on just where do we see potential savings in streamlining and what is DOL, I think it, probably for us, pushes us further down that path of trying to simplify the lineup and rationalize funds that may -- in a post-DOL world, may not fit neatly into more of an advisory model versus a traditional brokerage model. Those are the debates we're having internally now, and that could create some efficiencies. But I think from a cost side, this is a business that every basis point is going to matter. And I think the good news on some outcomes from the DOL is you're going to have a lower front-end sales charge that will help with some of your relative rankings. And then as we said, and I think in our announcement at Morningstar, it's now the A shares is not going to use those maximum charge because most of it's done at a net asset value. And that's going to make us more competitive where we see a lot of our funds will increase its star rating. So I think those are very positive outcomes, and I think our concern of having 35 share classes at least now where we feel like we'll only have to add a few."

But if you have large assets, the probability of your fund being included, even in a period of underperformance, it's highly unlikely that it's going to be eliminated from that lineup. So I think size matters quite a bit as far as continuing to get shelf space in the new model. But it is higher risk from a retention standpoint than your traditional brokerage model where it's more a one-on-one relationship. Here, it's more of a gatekeeper-, consultant-driven, more institutional-type relationship.

That's one of the reasons that we launched our strategic beta lineup because we're going to be able to play in the -- in more of an active space within the retail business. What we're seeing from advisers is, frankly, there's a lot of confusion because a lot of advisers have built a commission-based business, and that's where you're selling a product to a client. Now they're being looked at as having they're being required to build portfolios. That's a very different business model. That's a very different skill set. So we're working -- again, we're doing an extensive training internally to be able to work with advisers to help them with that.

I -- it was exactly the question I had to our group early this morning. When I was, like, going through some of the numbers, I thought that, that stood out on hybrid gross dropping, and there are some other moving parts in that number. Because actually, the Franklin Income Fund, its gross sales were exactly level quarter-over-quarter despite the number of hybrid declining. It had almost exactly the same level of gross, and that's the key driver with some other parts in that. I mean, K2 falls into the hybrid category, and that had a little bit of a drop-off quarter-over-quarter. So that contributed to the gross number dropping down. But I think it -- we are very optimistic that, that fund should continue to be a strong driver of our flows in this kind of environment. And I think it takes a little bit of time for people to realize that it's back in the top decile for the 1 year, and you have a lag effect of energy prices and what that did to a lot of our funds. And I look at across the lineup, and I'm very encouraged right now. I think we talked about it in the past as the value. With the value discipline, you tend to get more energy exposure than sometimes the market. And a lot of that has come back, along with materials, and whether it's our high-yield area, the income fund area and hybrid Templeton area and mutual series, all of our rising dividend funds, all those funds now are performing very well. So I would hope that we will get some momentum back now on the strong 1-year numbers. And actually, our hybrid and equity assets, 75% of them are in the top 2 quartiles for the 1 year.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our commentary on fourth quarter and fiscal year results.This was a challenging year in many respects. However, I'm pleased to see",1324,"Hello, and good morning. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our commentary on fourth quarter and fiscal year results.
This was a challenging year in many respects. However, I'm pleased to see that investment performance broadly improved over the course of the year and that we made significant progress on our most important strategic initiatives. Improved investment performance has clearly helped to slow redemptions, which were down almost 25% from last year. We did see a modest improvement in international retail flows, but that was offset by some institutional redemptions as well as improved U.S. fixed income flows.
Financial results were solid with operating income of $2.4 billion on a 36% operating margin. On the capital management side, we returned over $1.7 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases, representing more than 100% of net income. For the year, we purchased 36.6 million shares, decreasing shares outstanding by 5.5% on a net basis.
Understandably, the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule has triggered a number of questions from investors. And while it's clear that the rule will greatly impact the financial services firms, I want to assure everyone that we are working closely with our distribution partners to ensure our firm is well positioned once the rule takes effect.
Many broker-dealers are choosing to apply the Best Interest Contract Exemption allowed under the rule, while also building new mutual fund programs to offer levelized pricing and compensation. The industry is moving in the direction of 2 general product types. The first is a more traditional share class structure with lower commission and standardized 12b-1 fees, while the second will have more of a transaction-based fee structure. There's still a lot of work to be done, but introducing new share classes and responding to evolving regulations is nothing new to us.
Overall, our investment teams continue to deliver solid, long-term performance and importantly, we've seen relative performance improve in several key areas over the last year. Franklin Income Fund, our largest fund by assets, outperformed its benchmark for the year and was a top-decile performer against its peer group. Other key funds such as Franklin Rising Dividends, with its focus on dividend growth; and Templeton Foreign, an international equity strategy, experienced very strong rebounds in absolute and relative performance, beating their benchmarks and delivering top quartile relative performance.
Another positive development on the performance front is the enhancements that Morningstar is making in its rating methodology. Among other changes, Morningstar is removing load adjustments that previously assumed the maximum fee for load investors, even though most investors don't pay any sales charge in an A share class. This change will level out the playing field between share classes and better reflect current state of the industry. At the industry level, most funds are expected to keep their current star rating. However, we estimate that nearly 1/3 of our Class A shares will see an increase of 1 star, including key funds like Templeton Global Bond and Franklin Rising Dividend.
Assets under management were essentially flat compared to last quarter as we continue to benefit from a diversified mix of assets under management. Long-term outflows continue. While sales were flat this quarter, redemptions increased somewhat, leading to outflows of $22 billion, but market appreciation of $24 billion offset the impact of flows for the quarter.
From a retail perspective, redemptions have been improving since the fourth quarter of last year on the back of improving performance. Sales overall continue to be challenged as advisers remain cautious given the ongoing volatility, historical performance challenges and the upcoming implementation of the DOL rule in the U.S. Consequently, large outflows continue from certain flagship funds. We did, however, see international retail sales improve again this quarter, driven by a pickup in demand from clients in Asia and parts of Europe for a range of strategies.
While it may take some time given current economic conditions and market valuations, we remain confident that demand for our flagship products will recover as advisers and clients are utilizing a wait-and-see approach to determine if there's a consistency in improved performance.
In the meantime, we continue to keep advisers informed about the current positioning of our portfolios and the perspective behind the portfolio manager's convictions. Our variable annuity business, which is included in U.S. retail flows, has been under pressure for the past 2 years as some of our insurance partners exited the business, while others made a shift to passive. Those decisions led to cumulative net outflows of $13 billion since the fourth quarter of last year, including $1 billion this quarter from our variable insurance product and sub-advised funds. Those flows have impacted nearly all investment objectives and are illustrated in the flow graphs by investment objective.
We wanted to provide some additional clarity and background on flows from this business because we expect an additional $2.6 billion of redemptions to hit this quarter, with most of that expected in October and an additional $4.8 billion to be redeemed in the second quarter. This remains an important business for the company, and we believe that we are now better positioned to meet the evolving asset allocation needs of our insurance partners.
Looking now at flows by investment objective for the quarter. Overall flows into our global strategies remain challenged as redemptions were elevated. However, sales held up and were essentially flat. On the global equity side, a large institutional redemption of about $1.5 billion from an emerging market strategy increased net outflows as did retail outflows from the U.S. versions of Mutual Global Discovery and Templeton Growth Funds. As of quarter end, Templeton Global Bond and Templeton Global Total Return Funds underperformed on an absolute and relative basis due to currency positions, which offset the impact of interest rate strategies and the neutral impact of sovereign credit exposures. As a result, we continue to see net outflows in global fixed income from our retail clients.
Our global macro team believes that a return to a more normalized monetary policy in the U.S. has the potential to catalyze global markets towards a broad fundamental recovery.
The strengthening U.S. economy, along with rising U.S. Treasury yields would magnify the fundamental differences between healthy and vulnerable economies, leading to respective appreciations and depreciations against the U.S. dollar. These events could be significant catalysts for improved performance on our global fixed income strategies. In fact, over the past month through October, the Global Bond Fund recaptured a sizable portion of its year-to-date underperformance due to its currency positions and a slight rise in rates.
U.S. equity redemptions increased this quarter, which was consistent with the industry, leading to net outflows of almost $3 billion for the category. Looking at hybrid flows, we've seen an uptick in sales from Q1 into the Franklin Income Fund due to sustained performance improvements, and the fund has been the firm's highest gross selling product for 7 months in a row. While sales have been fairly flat for the past 3 quarters, we've also seen a consistent slowdown of redemptions, leading to improved net flows for this fund, although hybrid products remain in net outflows overall.
U.S. fixed income was a clear positive story for us this quarter. Good performance and attractive yields in our tax-free income products, combined with a strong brand and long-standing history in the municipal bond market, has generated increased demand for these products in recent quarters, leading to strong sales and net inflows of $600 million for the quarter. Majority of that has been in our California bond funds, with a number of them finishing in the top 10 for net flows.
The U.S. taxable funds, while not quite in positive territory, continue their upward trajectory with a significant increase in sales and a decrease in redemptions this quarter.
I'd now like to turn it over to Ken to discuss operating results."

The financial results for the year reflected some of the challenges that Greg mentioned, but remained solid. Operating income for the year was a strong $2.4 billion. This was due in part to a number of cost management initiatives that resulted in non-sales and distribution expense savings, inclusive of implementation cost of more than 5%. This exceeded the cost savings projections I provided last quarter because we decided not to secure the assets and liabilities of a closed pension plan in Europe. In light of the changing economic climate in Europe, it no longer made economic sense to pursue that course of action.
Net income was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 15%. And earnings per share was $2.94, a decrease of only 11% due to a 5% decrease in shares outstanding. Focusing on the fourth quarter, on Slide 15, operating income was almost $580 million, a slight decrease of 3% from the third quarter. Net income was $472 million and earnings per share was $0.82.
Investment management fees increased slightly, reflecting a similar increase in daily average assets under management from last quarter. Excluding performance fees of $3.3 million, the effective fee rate based on daily average assets under management was down slightly, offsetting the additional day in the quarter.
Sales and distribution fees decreased to $441 million as the modest increase in asset-based fees were more than offset by lower U.S. commissionable sales. Shareholder servicing fees were $58 million, a 5% decrease from last quarter, due mostly to lower billable accounts following the annual purge of closed accounts in the U.S. during the quarter.
Operating expenses declined 1% as seasonal increase in several expense categories offset lower compensation and sales and distribution expenses.
Compensation and benefits expense was $317 million, a decrease of almost $10 million due to lower severance and payroll taxes in the current quarter. IT, occupancy and general and administrative expenses all experienced a seasonal increase as typical of the fourth quarter.
Looking towards fiscal 2017, based on the current revenue environment, we're budgeting for non-sales and distribution expenses to be flat to down a couple percent compared with 2016.
We recognize that we cannot cut our way to growth and plan to invest some of last year's cost reductions into growth initiatives, including expanding our ETF platform and new product launches as well as new technology. That, of course, means from a modeling perspective, we are budgeting for technology expense to increase.
As illustrated on Slide 18, the decline in average assets under management led to a lower though still very strong operating margin of 35.7% for the year. The fiscal year tax rate came in about 150 basis points lower than anticipated at 29.7% in rough terms. About half of this was attributable to discrete items, with the rest reflecting earnings mix.
We're currently forecasting the fiscal year 2017 tax rate to be around 31.5%, with the relative mix of U.S. earnings to that of lower tax jurisdictions expected to push the rate up or down.
Investment and other income net of noncontrolling interest was $65 million, more or less flat compared to the prior quarter, with most of the gains coming from equity method investments.
Turning to capital management. We repurchased an additional 7.2 million shares during the quarter at a total cost of $256 million. This brought total repurchases for the year to 36.6 million shares at a total cost of $1.3 billion.
Combined with dividends, the fiscal year payout was over $1.7 billion, representing a total payout ratio of over 100% of net income. This exceeds U.S. earnings and resulted in a $500 million decrease in U.S. net cash and investments since last year.
This concludes our comments on the quarter's results, looking forward to speaking with you on the call later today."

I think from the last call, we continue to make a lot of progress, a lot of work being done on getting ready for April. I think the good news is that there seems -- our concern has always been that it's not workable to come out with a different pricing structure for every broker-dealer out there, and we seem to be narrowing those options down to, hopefully, two. And then you saw the recent announcement around a clean share class or super-class or whatever you want to call them and having more of a stripped-down version available at some point in the future. That could be an option as well where you have the pricing handled at the broker-dealer level. All of that, I think, is happening. The question about what effect will it have, I think the net effect -- there were some surveys done. It said -- one said that you'll have 10% to 15% less advisers out there. I think that some would retire. The transition is going to be very difficult to go to the new model. So I think that, that can be disruptive as well. And I just think overall, our sense is once we get past this, you'll get to a more normalized environment. But right now, it is very disruptive force for the adviser.

Those are the debates we're having internally now, and that could create some efficiencies. But I think from a cost side, this is a business that every basis point is going to matter. And I think the good news on some outcomes from the DOL is you're going to have a lower front-end sales charge that will help with some of your relative rankings. And then as we said, and I think in our announcement at Morningstar, it's now the A shares is not going to use those maximum charge because most of it's done at a net asset value. And that's going to make us more competitive where we see a lot of our funds will increase its star rating.

I mean, you can get significant assets quickly, and you could lose significant assets quickly. I think that's the net effect. I think the advantage of the transition, it's like a funnel where there's going to be less funds available in the new model. But if you have large assets, the probability of your fund being included, even in a period of underperformance, it's highly unlikely that it's going to be eliminated from that lineup. So I think size matters quite a bit as far as continuing to get shelf space in the new model. But it is higher risk from a retention standpoint than your traditional brokerage model where it's more a one-on-one relationship. Here, it's more of a gatekeeper-, consultant-driven, more institutional-type relationship. And we've transitioned our model to, I think, adapt to that and have more people with consulting experience at that point of contact with the home offices."

So as you know, we have extensive operations in low-cost jurisdictions. And so when we compare the cost of doing it ourselves to what -- cost for outsourcing, it makes economic sense for us to keep it in source. That's the current thinking. But as things change, outsourcing companies get more efficient. So it's a continuous evaluation."

It's -- we see that as more of a near-term opportunity to acquire something that would be additive to our lineup and strengthen our presence in a market where we don't really have a strong presence in the U.K. Outside of that, I think the others become much more difficult and a larger one that is much harder to do and much more disruptive, obviously, to the entire organization. But one that in the right situation again is something that we would certainly look at. But I think it is much more difficult to execute."

I -- it was exactly the question I had to our group early this morning. When I was, like, going through some of the numbers, I thought that, that stood out on hybrid gross dropping, and there are some other moving parts in that number. Because actually, the Franklin Income Fund, its gross sales were exactly level quarter-over-quarter despite the number of hybrid declining. It had almost exactly the same level of gross, and that's the key driver with some other parts in that. I mean, K2 falls into the hybrid category, and that had a little bit of a drop-off quarter-over-quarter. So that contributed to the gross number dropping down. But I think it -- we are very optimistic that, that fund should continue to be a strong driver of our flows in this kind of environment. And I think it takes a little bit of time for people to realize that it's back in the top decile for the 1 year, and you have a lag effect of energy prices and what that did to a lot of our funds. And I look at across the lineup, and I'm very encouraged right now. I think we talked about it in the past as the value. With the value discipline, you tend to get more energy exposure than sometimes the market. And a lot of that has come back, along with materials, and whether it's our high-yield area, the income fund area and hybrid Templeton area and mutual series, all of our rising dividend funds, all those funds now are performing very well. So I would hope that we will get some momentum back now on the strong 1-year numbers. And actually, our hybrid and equity assets, 75% of them are in the top 2 quartiles for the 1 year. So I think that's a big change from where we were 6 months ago."

That's going to make it a little bit easier to lower overall management fees and make you more competitive on that basis. Others -- other areas, I think distributor retention, the historic number that actually was going away anyway over time, but that goes away immediately if you give up pricing at the broker-dealer level this new class of shares. But as the world was transitioning more to advisory, the traditional A share was getting smaller and smaller as part of our business. So that changes as well. TA fees, all those things, sub-TA fees, all of those are again in a state of flux. So I think it's early, but just to say, it puts everything kind of in play at this stage."
