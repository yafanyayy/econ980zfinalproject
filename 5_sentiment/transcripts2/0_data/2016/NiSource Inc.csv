We'll then open the call to your questions. As a reminder, we will be referring to supplemental slides that are available on the NiSource website. 
Before moving onto our highlights for the quarter and the year, I would just remind everyone that we successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015. Therefore, the results for CPG are contained in discontinued operations. And finally, one last reminder, some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. With all that covered, I would like to turn the call over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a dynamic year of progress for NiSource. Our teams executed on our customer focus, investment driven utility business plan, while successfully completing the Columbia Pipeline Group separation. We finished 2015 building on the momentum we've gained in the past few years with an eye towards continued growth and enhanced performance in 2016 and beyond. 
Let's take a look at Slide 3 of the supplemental deck to walk through some of the significant milestones NiSource achieved in 2015. The NiSource team delivered strong financial results in line with the expectations with net operating earnings non-GAAP of $0.94 per share compared to $0.81 per share in 2014. We invested a record $1.37 billion in our utility infrastructure across our 7 states. As part of that investment, we replaced 361 miles of priority pipe, including the last known cast-iron pipes throughout the Columbia Gas of Virginia systems. All of NiSource's utility investments are focused on serving our customers, enhancing safety and service reliability and reducing environmental impact. We reached a significant milestone during the year by completing the last of 3 bluegrass authorization or SGP units at NIPSCO's cold generation facility. This is the combination of approximately $850 million in investments over 5 years, all completed on schedule and on budget that will help improve air quality and ensure that NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. Also in 2015, we completed the full deployment of automated meter reading devices across our nearly 4 million electric and natural gas customers. A 6-year project, this new meeter technology enhances customer service and safety, while reducing costs. We also continued our electric transmission and distribution modernization program, investing about $65 million to improve service reliability and system performance. 
NiSource has now executed against more than $2 billion of our identified $30 billion in long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments, since outlining these programs in 2014. In addition to these significant infrastructure investment milestones, the NiSource team completed several significant regulatory initiatives, which support safety, reliability, employee training and customer programs. These milestones include: successful rate case settlements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia; the extension of Columbia Gas of Virginia system modernization program; approval of the first year of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan; and continued execution of Columbia Gas of Ohio's modernization program, along with new pipeline safety programs implemented in 2015. We also had a strong performance in J.D. Power's residential natural gas customer satisfaction survey with Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, an award winner for the second straight year and Columbia Gas of Virginia recognized as one of the nation's most improved brands. 
Across NiSource, we are sharpening our focus on service to our customers and communities and these results reflect those commitments. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slide. Donald?"

As a reminder, these results no longer include CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The financial progress we're reporting today for 2015 was driven exclusively by our regulated utility businesses. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015, compared with about $256 million or $0.81 per share in 2014. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported $832 million for 2015, which is an increase of about $54 million over 2014. Taking a closer look at the annual operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments, our gas distribution segment delivered about $568 million compared with about $517 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by more than $105 million, primarily due to the impact of new rates in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, an implementation of rates under our approved infrastructure replacement program in a number of states. 
Operating expenses, including the impact of trackers, increased by about $55 million, mainly due to higher employee administrative costs as well as increased depreciation and property taxes as a result of higher capital investments. Our Electric Operations segment reported about $280 million compared to about $288 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were relatively flat. Operating expenses, again excluding trackers, increased by about $10 million, primarily due to increased depreciation driven by higher capital investments. 
As Joe mentioned, our 2015 results are well in line with our expectations. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I would like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $6.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and an interest rate of approximately 5.88%. On the liquidity front, at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.2 billion. And our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and for continued growth and execution. I would also note that the recent extension of bonus depreciation has no impact on our 2016 earnings guidance or long-term growth commitments. Consistent with what we've shared previously, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016. And in the years ahead, we continue to expect annual dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."
292092,323666400,935389,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald.

As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom were privileged to serve. Early in the call, I mentioned, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Virginia were recognized for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power. In fact, I am proud to say J.D. Power scores improved at all of NiSource utilities in 2015 compared to the prior year. We were recognized in other areas as well including being named for the second consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, illustrating our deep commitment to serving customers, employees and other stakeholders in a way that balances immediate and long-term benefits. And NiSource was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Institute for the fourth straight year. 
Let's turn to a few recent highlights on our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to focus on timely recovery of our customer focused infrastructure investments, and we continued to make progress on that front in the fourth quarter. At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. We filed our semiannual tracker and program update in August of last year and expect to commission order in the first quarter of this year. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas. 
In December, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received commission approval of a settlement in its base rate case. The settlement maintains the company's ability to continue replacing and upgrading its natural gas distribution systems. New rates went into effect on December 18 and will increase annual revenues by approximately $28 million. The settlement also included new incentives that will significantly reduce initial costs for customers converting to natural gas. 
On November 1, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts implemented new rates under its previously approved base rate case settlements. The settlement supports CMA's continued effort to modernize its pipeline infrastructure and transform its operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. The approved settlement provides for increased annual revenues of $32.8 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase starting on November 1 of this year. 
Across our gas utilities, we invested over $900 million in 2015 and expect to invest more than $950 million this year. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On December 16, the Indiana utility regulatory commission or IURC approved the settlement between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest industrial customers, which result all outstanding issues raised by parties in Indiana court of appeals proceeding related to the company's previous long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. Following that development, NIPSCO on December 31 filed a new $1.3 billion 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the IURC. The plan is focused on electric transmission and distribution investments made for safety, reliability and system modernization. NiSource expects an order on its 7-year plan by the third quarter of 2016. 
Progress also continued on 2 major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability, right away acquisition permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. Line and construction is expected to begin in 2016. These projects involve an investment of approximately $450 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. NIPSCO remains on schedule with its electric base rate case filed in October with the IURC. The case seeks to update rates to reflect the current cost of generating and distributing power plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including programs that have reduced the duration of power outages by 40%. We have worked with our customers and other stakeholders to seek a balanced solution, that recognizes the importance and value of reliable and affordable energy for all customers, particularly the energy intensive steel in industrial sectors in Northwest Indiana. The Indiana team has made progress with settlement discussions with the possibility of reaching a final settlement as early as tomorrow in order to meet the procedural deadline. As you would you expect, we are discussion at this point, and I will not be able to provide any details beyond what I've noted. 
We invested about $400 million in our electric business in 2015 and expect to invest more than $400 million in 2016. We took positive steps to position the business for future investment-driven growth that will create value for NIPSCO customers, northern Indiana communities and our shareholders. 
Before turning to your questions, I would like to reinforce NiSource's investment proposition and our 2016 guidance. As Donald already highlighted, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016 with approximately $1.4 billion in infrastructure enhancements planned during the year. Our well-established utility investment programs continued to produce high-value for our customers and investors in 2015. As we began our first full year as a pure play utility company, we're sharpening our focus on leadership and safety and customer satisfaction to unlock the full potential of our plan. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing our continued update on our progress.

And while this has a negative impact on rate base, it does give us that cash at the kind of tailwind of our planning horizon to give us cash that we can send a little bit more on CapEx in the early years, a nominal amount to offset that negative impact on rate base and by the end of the planning horizon actually be a net cash flow positive. So it keeps our earnings and guidance and dividend guidance in line, on the backend of our planning horizon gives us some incremental cash and provide some flexibility in our liquidity."

As you know, the purpose of today's call is to review the NiSource's financial performance for 2015, as well as provide a business update, covering our utility operations and growth drivers. We'll then open the call to your questions. As a reminder, we will be referring to supplemental slides that are available on the NiSource website. 
Before moving on to our highlights for the quarter and the year, I would just remind everyone that we successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group on July 1, 2015. Therefore, the results for CPG are contained in discontinued operations. And finally, one last reminder, some of the statements made on this call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. With all that covered, I would like to turn the call over to Joe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a dynamic year of progress for NiSource. Our teams executed on our customer focus, investment-driven utility business plan, while successfully completing the Columbia Pipeline Group separation. We finished 2015 building on the momentum we've gained in the past few years with an eye towards continued growth and enhanced performance in 2016 and beyond. 
Let's take a look at Slide 3 of the supplemental deck to walk through some of the significant milestones NiSource achieved in 2015. The NiSource team delivered strong financial results in line with the expectations with net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of $0.94 per share compared to $0.81 per share in 2014. We invested a record $1.37 billion in our utility infrastructure across our 7 states. As part of that investment, we replaced 361 miles of priority pipe, including the last known cast-iron pipes throughout the Columbia Gas of Virginia systems. All of NiSource's utility investments are focused on serving our customers, enhancing safety and service reliability and reducing environmental impact. We reached a significant milestone during the year by completing the last of 3 flue gas desulfurization or FGD units at NIPSCO's cold generation facility. This is the combination of approximately $850 million in investments over 5 years, all completed on schedule and on budget that will help improve air quality and ensure that NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. Also in 2015, we completed the full deployment of automated meter reading devices across our nearly 4 million electric and natural gas customers. A 6-year project, this new meter technology enhances customer service and safety, while reducing costs. We also continued our electric transmission and distribution modernization program, investing about $65 million to improve service reliability and system performance. 
NiSource has now executed against more than $2 billion of our identified $30 billion in long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments, since outlining these programs in 2014. In addition to these significant infrastructure investment milestones, the NiSource team completed several significant regulatory initiatives, which support safety, reliability, employee training and customer programs. These milestones include successful rate case settlements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia; the extension of Columbia Gas of Virginia system modernization program; approval of the first year of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan; and continued execution of Columbia Gas of Ohio's modernization program, along with new pipeline safety programs implemented in 2015. We also had a strong performance in J.D. Power's residential natural gas customer satisfaction survey with Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, an award winner for the second straight year and Columbia Gas of Virginia recognized as one of the nation's most improved brands. 
Across NiSource, we are sharpening our focus on service to our customers and communities, and these results reflect those commitments. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Donald?"

As a reminder, these results no longer include CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The financial progress we're reporting today for 2015 was driven exclusively by our regulated utility businesses. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015, compared with about $256 million or $0.81 per share in 2014. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported $832 million for 2015, which is an increase of about $54 million over 2014. Taking a closer look at the annual operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments, our gas distribution segment delivered about $568 million compared with about $517 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by more than $105 million, primarily due to the impact of new rates in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, an implementation of rates under our approved infrastructure replacement program in a number of states. 
Operating expenses, including the impact of trackers, increased by about $55 million, mainly due to higher employee administrative costs as well as increased depreciation and property taxes as a result of higher capital investments. Our Electric Operations segment reported about $280 million compared to about $288 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were relatively flat. Operating expenses, again excluding trackers, increased by about $10 million, primarily to increased depreciation driven by higher capital investments. 
As Joe mentioned, our 2015 results are well in line with our expectations. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $6.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and an interest rate of approximately 5.88%. On the liquidity front, at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.2 billion. And our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and hoist for continued growth and execution. I would also note that the recent extension of bonus depreciation has no impact on our 2016 earnings guidance or long-term growth commitments. Consistent with what we've shared previously, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016. And in the years ahead, we continue to expect annual dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."
292092,323666400,935482,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom were privileged to serve. Earlier in the call, I mentioned, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Virgi",888,"Thanks, Donald. As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom were privileged to serve. Earlier in the call, I mentioned, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Virginia were recognized for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power. In fact, I'm proud to say J.D. Power scores improved at all of NiSource utilities in 2015 compared to the prior year. We were recognized in other areas as well including being named for the second consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, illustrating our deep commitment to serving customers, employees and other stakeholders in a way that balances immediate and long-term benefits. And NiSource was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute for the fourth straight year. 
Let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to focus on timely recovery of our customer-focused infrastructure investments, and we continued to make progress on that front in the fourth quarter. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. We filed our semiannual tracker and program update in August of last year and expect to commission order in the first quarter of this year. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas. 
In December, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received commission approval of a settlement in its base rate case. The settlement maintains the company's ability to continue replacing and upgrading its natural gas distribution systems. New rates went into effect on December 18, and will increase annual revenues by approximately $28 million. The settlement also included new incentives that will significantly reduce initial costs for customers converting to natural gas. 
On November 1, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts implemented new rates under its previously approved base rate case settlements. The settlement supports CMA's continued effort to modernize its pipeline infrastructure and transform its operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. The approved settlement provides for increased annual revenues of $32.8 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase, starting on November 1 of this year. 
Across our gas utilities, we invested over $900 million in 2015 and expect to invest more than $950 million this year. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On December 16, the Indiana utility regulatory commission or IURC approved a settlement between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest industrial customers, which resolved all outstanding issues raised by parties in an Indiana court of appeals proceeding related to the company's previous long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. Following that development, NIPSCO on December 31 filed a new $1.3 billion 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the IURC. The plan is focused on electric transmission and distribution investments made for safety, reliability and system modernization. NiSource expects an order on its 7-year plan by the third quarter of 2016. 
Progress also continued on 2 major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right away acquisition permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. Line and tower construction is expected to begin in 2016. These projects involve an investment of approximately $450 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. NIPSCO remains on schedule with its electric base rate case filed in October with the IURC. The case seeks to update rates to reflect the current costs of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including programs that have reduced the duration of power outages by 40%. We have worked with our customers and other stakeholders to seek a balanced solution that recognizes the importance and value of reliable and affordable energy for all customers, particularly the energy intensive steel and industrial sectors in Northwest Indiana. The Indiana team has made progress with settlement discussions with the possibility of reaching a final settlement as early as tomorrow in order to meet the procedural deadline. As you would expect, we are in sensitive discussions at this point, and I will not be able to provide any details beyond what I've noted. 
We invested about $400 million in our electric business in 2015 and expect to invest more than $400 million in 2016. We took positive steps to position the business for future investment-driven growth that will create value for NIPSCO customers, Northern Indiana communities and our shareholders. 
Before turning to your questions, I would like to reinforce NiSource's investment proposition and our 2016 guidance. As Donald already highlighted, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016 with approximately $1.4 billion in infrastructure enhancements planned during the year. Our well-established utility investment programs continued to produce high value for our customers and investors in 2015. As we began our first full year as a pure play utility company, we're sharpening our focus on leadership and safety and customer satisfaction to unlock the full potential of our plan. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.

So it's probably 2021 where we are a net taxpayer. And while this has a negative impact on rate base, it does give us that cash at the kind of tailwind of our planning horizon to give us cash that we can spend a little bit more on CapEx in the early years, a nominal amount, to offset that negative impact on rate base and by the end of the planning horizon actually be a net cash flow positive. So it keeps our earnings guidance and dividend guidance in line and on the back-end of our planning horizon gives us some incremental cash and provide some flexibility in our liquidity."

They are already well established. So we tend to have a fairly confident outlook within the range, but, nonetheless, can see a number of things that could change in any given year relative to the mix of regulatory outcomes.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a dynamic year of progress for NiSource. Our teams executed on our customer focus, investment-driven utility business plan, while successfully completing the Columbia Pipeline Group separation. We finished 2015 building on the momentum we've gained in the past few years with an eye towards continued growth and enhanced performance in 2016 and beyond. 
Let's take a look at Slide 3 of the supplemental deck to walk through some of the significant milestones NiSource achieved in 2015. The NiSource team delivered strong financial results in line with the expectations with net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of $0.94 per share compared to $0.81 per share in 2014. We invested a record $1.37 billion in our utility infrastructure across our 7 states. As part of that investment, we replaced 361 miles of priority pipe, including the last known cast-iron pipes throughout the Columbia Gas of Virginia systems. All of NiSource's utility investments are focused on serving our customers, enhancing safety and service reliability and reducing environmental impact. We reached a significant milestone during the year by completing the last of 3 flue gas desulfurization or FGD units at NIPSCO's cold generation facility. This is the combination of approximately $850 million in investments over 5 years, all completed on schedule and on budget that will help improve air quality and ensure that NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. Also in 2015, we completed the full deployment of automated meter reading devices across our nearly 4 million electric and natural gas customers. A 6-year project, this new meter technology enhances customer service and safety, while reducing costs. We also continued our electric transmission and distribution modernization program, investing about $65 million to improve service reliability and system performance. 
NiSource has now executed against more than $2 billion of our identified $30 billion in long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments, since outlining these programs in 2014. In addition to these significant infrastructure investment milestones, the NiSource team completed several significant regulatory initiatives, which support safety, reliability, employee training and customer programs. These milestones include successful rate case settlements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia; the extension of Columbia Gas of Virginia's system modernization program; approval of the first year of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan; and continued execution of Columbia Gas of Ohio's modernization program, along with new pipeline safety programs implemented in 2015. We also had a strong performance in J.D. Power's residential natural gas customer satisfaction survey with Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, an award winner for the second straight year and Columbia Gas of Virginia recognized as one of the nation's most improved brands. 
Across NiSource, we are sharpening our focus on service to our customers and communities, and these results reflect those commitments. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Donald?"

As a reminder, these results no longer include CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The financial progress we're reporting today for 2015 was driven exclusively by our regulated utility businesses. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015, compared with about $256 million or $0.81 per share in 2014. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported $832 million for 2015, which is an increase of about $54 million over 2014. Taking a closer look at the annual operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments, our gas distribution segment delivered about $568 million compared with about $517 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by more than $105 million, primarily due to the impact of new rates in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, an implementation of rates under our approved infrastructure replacement program in a number of states. 
Operating expenses, including the impact of trackers, increased by about $55 million, mainly due to higher employee and administrative costs as well as increased depreciation and property taxes as a result of higher capital investments. Our Electric Operations segment reported about $280 million compared to about $288 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were relatively flat. Operating expenses, again excluding trackers, increased by about $10 million, primarily to increased depreciation driven by higher capital investments. 
As Joe mentioned, our 2015 results are well in line with our expectations. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $6.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and an interest rate of approximately 5.88%. On the liquidity front, at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.2 billion. And our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued growth and execution. I would also note that the recent extension of bonus depreciation has no impact on our 2016 earnings guidance or long-term growth commitments. Consistent with what we've shared previously, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016. And in the years ahead, we continue to expect annual dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."
292092,323666400,935601,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom we're privileged to serve.

As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom we're privileged to serve. Earlier in the call, I mentioned, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Virginia were recognized for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power. In fact, I'm proud to say J.D. Power scores improved at all of NiSource utilities in 2015 compared to the prior year. We were recognized in other areas as well including being named for the second consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, illustrating our deep commitment to serving customers, employees and other stakeholders in a way that balances immediate and long-term benefits. And NiSource was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute for the fourth straight year. 
Let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to focus on timely recovery of our customer-focused infrastructure investments, and we continued to make progress on that front in the fourth quarter. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. We filed our semiannual tracker and program update in August of last year and expect to commission order in the first quarter of this year. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas. 
In December, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received commission approval of a settlement in its base rate case. The settlement maintains the company's ability to continue replacing and upgrading its natural gas distribution systems. New rates went into effect on December 18, and will increase annual revenues by approximately $28 million. The settlement also included new incentives that will significantly reduce initial costs for customers converting to natural gas. 
On November 1, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts implemented new rates under its previously approved base rate case settlements. The settlement supports CMA's continued effort to modernize its pipeline infrastructure and transform its operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. The approved settlement provides for increased annual revenues of $32.8 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase, starting on November 1 of this year. 
Across our gas utilities, we invested over $900 million in 2015 and expect to invest more than $950 million this year. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On December 16, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC approved a settlement between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest industrial customers, which resolved all outstanding issues raised by parties in an Indiana court of appeals proceeding related to the company's previous long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. Following that development, NIPSCO on December 31 filed a new $1.3 billion 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the IURC. The plan is focused on electric transmission and distribution investments made for safety, reliability and system modernization. NiSource expects an order on its 7-year plan by the third quarter of 2016. 
Progress also continued on 2 major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right of way acquisition permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. Line and tower construction is expected to begin in 2016. These projects involve an investment of approximately $450 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. NIPSCO remains on schedule with its electric base rate case filed in October with the IURC. The case seeks to update rates to reflect the current costs of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including programs that have reduced the duration of power outages by 40%. We have worked with our customers and other stakeholders to seek a balanced solution that recognizes the importance and value of reliable and affordable energy for all customers, particularly the energy intensive steel and industrial sectors in Northwest Indiana. The Indiana team has made progress with settlement discussions with the possibility of reaching a final settlement as early as tomorrow in order to meet the procedural deadline. As you would expect, we are in sensitive discussions at this point, and I will not be able to provide any details beyond what I've noted. 
We invested about $400 million in our electric business in 2015 and expect to invest more than $400 million in 2016. We took positive steps to position the business for future investment-driven growth that will create value for NIPSCO customers, Northern Indiana communities and our shareholders. 
Before turning to your questions, I would like to reinforce NiSource's investment proposition and our 2016 guidance. As Donald already highlighted, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016 with approximately $1.4 billion in infrastructure enhancements planned during the year. Our well-established utility investment programs continued to produce high value for our customers and investors in 2015. As we begin our first full year as a pure play utility company, we're sharpening our focus on leadership and safety and customer satisfaction to unlock the full potential of our plan. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.

So it's probably 2021 where we are a net taxpayer. And while this has a negative impact on rate base, it does give us that cash at the kind of tailwind of our planning horizon to give us cash that we can spend a little bit more on CapEx in the early years, a nominal amount, to offset that negative impact on rate base and by the end of the planning horizon actually be a net cash flow positive. So it keeps our earnings guidance and dividend guidance in line and on the back-end of our planning horizon gives us some incremental cash and provides some flexibility in our liquidity."

So each state has either a rate case, as in Pennsylvania's fully forecasted rate year mechanism, or a tracker mechanism that are already well established. So we tend to have a fairly confident outlook within the range, but, nonetheless, can see a number of things that could change in any given year relative to the mix of regulatory outcomes.

Let's take a look at Slide 3 of the supplemental deck to walk through some of the significant milestones NiSource achieved in 2015. The NiSource team delivered strong financial results in line with the expectations with net operating earnings, non-GAAP, of $0.94 per share compared to $0.81 per share in 2014. We invested a record $1.37 billion in our utility infrastructure across our 7 states. As part of that investment, we replaced 361 miles of priority pipe, including the last known cast-iron pipes throughout the Columbia Gas of Virginia systems. All of NiSource's utility investments are focused on serving our customers, enhancing safety and service reliability and reducing environmental impact. We reached a significant milestone during the year by completing the last of 3 flue gas desulfurization or FGD units at NIPSCO's cold generation facility. This is the combination of approximately $850 million in investments over 5 years, all completed on schedule and on budget that will help improve air quality and ensure that NIPSCO's generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations. Also in 2015, we completed the full deployment of automated meter reading devices across our nearly 4 million electric and natural gas customers. A 6-year project, this new meter technology enhances customer service and safety, while reducing costs. We also continued our electric transmission and distribution modernization program, investing about $65 million to improve service reliability and system performance. 
NiSource has now executed against more than $2 billion of our identified $30 billion in long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments, since outlining these programs in 2014. In addition to these significant infrastructure investment milestones, the NiSource team completed several significant regulatory initiatives, which support safety, reliability, employee training and customer programs. These milestones include successful rate case settlements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia; the extension of Columbia Gas of Virginia's system modernization program; approval of the first year of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts Gas System Enhancement Plan; and continued execution of Columbia Gas of Ohio's modernization program, along with new pipeline safety programs implemented in 2015. We also had a strong performance in J.D. Power's residential natural gas customer satisfaction survey with Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, an award winner for the second straight year and Columbia Gas of Virginia recognized as one of the nation's most improved brands. 
Across NiSource, we are sharpening our focus on service to our customers and communities, and these results reflect those commitments. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Donald?"

As a reminder, these results no longer include CPG reportable segment financials, which are classified as discontinued operations. The financial progress we're reporting today for 2015 was driven exclusively by our regulated utility businesses. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $299 million or $0.94 per share in 2015, compared with about $256 million or $0.81 per share in 2014. 
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported $832 million for 2015, which is an increase of about $54 million over 2014. Taking a closer look at the annual operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments, our gas distribution segment delivered about $568 million compared with about $517 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by more than $105 million, primarily due to the impact of new rates in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, an implementation of rates under our approved infrastructure replacement program in a number of states. 
Operating expenses, including the impact of trackers, increased by about $55 million, mainly due to higher employee and administrative costs as well as increased depreciation and property taxes as a result of higher capital investments. Our Electric Operations segment reported about $280 million compared to about $288 million in 2014. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were relatively flat. Operating expenses, again excluding trackers, increased by about $10 million, primarily to increased depreciation driven by higher capital investments. 
As Joe mentioned, our 2015 results are well in line with our expectations. 
Full details of our results, including details of our fourth quarter performance, are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of December 31 was about $6.9 billion with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and an interest rate of approximately 5.88%. On the liquidity front, at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.2 billion. And our credit ratings at the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. 
Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued growth and execution. I would also note that the recent extension of bonus depreciation has no impact on our 2016 earnings guidance or long-term growth commitments. Consistent with what we've shared previously, we expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016. And in the years ahead, we continue to expect annual dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."
292092,323666400,936530,"NiSource Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Donald. As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom we're privileged to serve.

As we emerged from the separation of CPG last year, we sharpened our focus on our customers and communities, all of whom we're privileged to serve. Earlier in the call, I mentioned, the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Virginia were recognized for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power. In fact, I'm proud to say J.D. Power scores improved at all of NiSource utilities in 2015 compared to the prior year. We were recognized in other areas as well including being named for the second consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, illustrating our deep commitment to serving customers, employees and other stakeholders in a way that balances immediate and long-term benefits. And NiSource was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute for the fourth straight year. 
Let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on Slide 6. We continue to focus on timely recovery of our customer-focused infrastructure investments, and we continued to make progress on that front in the fourth quarter. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on our 7-year $817 million natural gas system modernization program. We filed our semiannual tracker and program update in August of last year and expect to commission order in the first quarter of this year. This program involves enhancing existing gas infrastructure and extending gas service to rural areas. 
In December, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania received commission approval of a settlement in its base rate case. The settlement maintains the company's ability to continue replacing and upgrading its natural gas distribution systems. New rates went into effect on December 18, and will increase annual revenues by approximately $28 million. The settlement also included new incentives that will significantly reduce initial costs for customers converting to natural gas. 
On November 1, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts implemented new rates under its previously approved base rate case settlements. The settlement supports CMA's continued effort to modernize its pipeline infrastructure and transform its operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. The approved settlement provides for increased annual revenues of $32.8 million with an additional $3.6 million annual increase, starting on November 1 of this year. 
Across our gas utilities, we invested over $900 million in 2015 and expect to invest more than $950 million this year. 
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. On December 16, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC approved a settlement between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO's largest industrial customers, which resolved all outstanding issues raised by parties in an Indiana court of appeals proceeding related to the company's previous long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. Following that development, NIPSCO on December 31 filed a new $1.3 billion 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the IURC. The plan is focused on electric transmission and distribution investments made for safety, reliability and system modernization. NiSource expects an order on its 7-year plan by the third quarter of 2016. 
Progress also continued on 2 major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right of way acquisition permitting and substation construction are underway for both projects. Line and tower construction is expected to begin in 2016. These projects involve an investment of approximately $450 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018. NIPSCO remains on schedule with its electric base rate case filed in October with the IURC. The case seeks to update rates to reflect the current costs of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments, which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including programs that have reduced the duration of power outages by 40%. We have worked with our customers and other stakeholders to seek a balanced solution that recognizes the importance and value of reliable and affordable energy for all customers, particularly the energy intensive steel and industrial sectors in Northwest Indiana. The Indiana team has made progress with settlement discussions with the possibility of reaching a final settlement as early as tomorrow in order to meet the procedural deadline. As you would expect, we are in sensitive discussions at this point, and I will not be able to provide any details beyond what I've noted. 
We invested about $400 million in our electric business in 2015 and expect to invest more than $400 million in 2016. We took positive steps to position the business for future investment-driven growth that will create value for NIPSCO customers, Northern Indiana communities and our shareholders. 
Before turning to your questions, I would like to reinforce NiSource's investment proposition and our 2016 guidance. As Donald already highlighted, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10 in 2016 with approximately $1.4 billion in infrastructure enhancements planned during the year. Our well-established utility investment programs continued to produce high value for our customers and investors in 2015. As we begin our first full year as a pure play utility company, we're sharpening our focus on leadership and safety and customer satisfaction to unlock the full potential of our plan. 
Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress.

So it's probably 2021 where we are a net taxpayer. And while this has a negative impact on rate base, it does give us that cash at the kind of tailwind of our planning horizon to give us cash that we can spend a little bit more on CapEx in the early years, a nominal amount, to offset that negative impact on rate base and by the end of the planning horizon actually be a net cash flow positive. So it keeps our earnings guidance and dividend guidance in line and on the back-end of our planning horizon gives us some incremental cash and provides some flexibility in our liquidity."

So each state has either a rate case, as in Pennsylvania's fully forecasted rate year mechanism, or a tracker mechanism that are already well established. So we tend to have a fairly confident outlook within the range, but, nonetheless, can see a number of things that could change in any given year relative to the mix of regulatory outcomes.

Turning to Slide 3 of our supplemental deck, let's now highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.60 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.57 in the same period in 2015. We are well-positioned to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings within our 2016 guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share. And with a strong start to the construction season, we're on track to execute on more than $1.4 billion in utility infrastructure investments planned for the year.

And our Columbia Gas teams led by Carl Levander, filed base rate cases in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and we received regulatory approval of gas system modernization plan updates in Indiana, Massachusetts and Ohio. On the organizational front, we announced changes aimed at further advancing our growth plan and enhancing performance. Pablo Vegas joined NiSource today as President of our Columbia Gas Group. He will oversee the 6 Columbia Gas companies, including leadership of state regulatory, customer and stakeholder performance, as well as customer service, billing, and new business platforms for all 7 NiSource companies. 
Pablo most recently served as President and Chief Operating Officer of AEP Ohio. With Pablo's appointment and the planned retirement of our human resources leader, Rob Campbell, Chief Regulatory Officer, Carl Levander, assumes the role of Executive Vice President, Regulatory Policy and Corporate Affairs, which includes responsibility for policy, Corporate Communications, Federal Government affairs, regulatory strategy and human resources at NiSource. I'll talk more about the significant progress across all our businesses later in the call, but first, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides.

On an opera",501,"Thanks to Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $191 million or $0.60 per share in the quarter compared with about $179 million or $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $399 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $35 million over the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $180 million for the quarter versus about $193 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments for the first quarter of 2016. Our gas distribution operations segment delivered about $330 million compared with about $306 million in 2015. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by nearly $35 million, primarily attributable to increases in regulatory and service program, including the impact of new rates in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania as well as the implementation of the new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio, approved infrastructure replacement program. 
Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by $10.3 million, primarily due to increased outside service costs and higher depreciation. Our electric operations reported about $72 million compared with about $67 million for 2015. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were essentially flat and operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by $4.8 million, primarily due to lower generation expenses, decreased employee and administrative costs and lower environmental expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher outside service costs. 
As Joe mentioned, our first quarter results positioned NiSource well to deliver net operating earnings within our guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share for the year. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7 billion, with a weighted average maturity and long-term debt of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.72%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015. On March 31st, we executed a 3-year $500 million term loan agreement, with the pricing of LIBOR plus 95 basis points. And utilizing that the major a feature, we have until the end of September to draw the full $500 million. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of more than $1 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And our credit rating from the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment-grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued execution and growth. Now, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

We began 2016 by building upon the positive momentum that we've gained in recent years and maintaining our sharp focus on serving our customers and communities. For instance, in March, we became a founding member of the U.S. EPA's natural gas star methane challenge program. Through our 5-year program commitment, NiSource will continue to replace cast iron and various steel pipelines remaining in our natural gas system. Since 2005, we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 23%. As part of our planned investments, we expect to further reduce methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet, a reduction of 10% compared to 2015. 
In addition to helping reduce emissions, our well-established infrastructure modernization programs are producing other meaningful benefits and adding value for our customers. For example, we've reduced gas leaks on our mains by 9% and by 14% on our service lines over the past 5 years. This builds on the safety and reliability of our system, and we've continued to receive recognition for doing business the right way. In March, NiSource was named for the fifth consecutive year as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Ethisphere honors companies for leading and promoting ethical business standards in key categories, which include ethics and compliance programs. This designation demonstrates our commitment to serving our customers with integrity and the highest of ethical business standards. 
Now let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on Slide 6. On March 18th, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to adjust its base rates in support of the company's continued upgrades and replacements of infrastructure and other programs to enhance pipeline safety. If approved as filed, the case would result in $55 million annual revenue increase. An order is expected by the end of the 2016. On April 20th, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacement rider. The rider provides for continued support of the company's well-established pipeline replacement program investments. This order authorizes an increase of about $21 million in annual revenue related to 2015 infrastructure investments of about $185 million. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year approximately $800 million long-term gas system modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. 
On March 30th, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved the semiannual tracker update that was filed in August, 2015 with additional revenues of $7.6 million, which covered approximately $74 million of investments through mid-2015. NIPSCO found its latest semiannual tracker update on February 29, which remains pending with the IURC. 
On April 29th, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability of its distribution system and to accommodate increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected by early 2017. A decision on Columbia Gas of Massachusetts 2016 Gas System Enhancement Plan was issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on April 29th. This approval allows for a recovery of investments through 2016 and will increase annual revenues by approximately $8.2 million, beginning May 1st. On April 15th, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates so it can support the continued replacement of aging pipe as well as adopt pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6.5 million. A commission order is expected by the end of 2016. And finally, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, on April 27, filed notice with the Kentucky Public Service Commission that it intends to file a request to adjust its base rate to support continued infrastructure investments. 
Now let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 7. On March 24th, NIPSCO reached a settlement agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, industrial customers, the LaPorte County Board of Commissioners and the Indiana Municipal Utility Group on the company's 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan. This plan includes more than $1.2 billion of transmission and distribution investments designed to improve system safety and reliability. An IURC order on the settlement is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. NIPSCO also reached an agreement in its electric base rate case currently pending before the IURC. The February 19 settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments in service improvements for customers. The proposed settlement agreement would increase annual revenues by $72.5 million. An IURC order is anticipated early in the third quarter of 2016. NIPSCO's 2 major electro transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345 KV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway on both projects. NIPSCO expects to provide updated project cost estimates prior to the commencement of line construction later this year. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to touch on our financial and growth commitments as well as how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014. As we've outlined previously, we expect to deliver net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10, and to make more than $1.4 billion in planned infrastructure investments in 2016. This 2016 earnings and investment guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%, which we first announced a year ago in anticipation of the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group. As we execute on our well-established plans, we're aligning our organization to capitalize on all of our strategic opportunities, including our infrastructure investment plans, while at the same time, looking at enhancements to our plan such as growing our customer base, improving service to our customers, and driving enhanced performance through the increased use of common platforms. These emerging elements of our plan are expected to enhance our existing best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and in support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Skyler?"

Vast majority of your covered by riders. And you've got this sort of 4% to 6% long-term earnings guidance drive out there. But the rate base growth guidance range is 6% to 8%. So how do we -- obviously that's very enticing, there seems like there' a lot of cushion in there. But you first gave that well before the bonus depreciation rules were extended for 5 years. And can you tell us about how that may have moved things around inside the guidance range? It still seems like you're well positioned to, at the minimum, hit the high end of the earnings guidance range, but maybe the rate base growth is less robust because of [indiscernible] and what you might do to offset that?"

I'll ask Donna to touch on the bonus and the relative impact on rate base and how we're navigating through that. But let me take this sort of the higher-level question about the relationship between our outlook, our guidance and our business plan. We think and firmly believe that one of the strengths of the NiSource story is the long-term visibility. The sustained investment platform we have that we outlined, as we noted a couple of years ago, with the $30 billion in investment. As we look through the future and the strong support we have across all 7 states for those kind of investments, that's a great engine for driving growth, the visibility and wanted to be sure that we put out a fairly long-term look at earnings guidance in that 4% to 6% annual growth range. We remain committed to that. As we've noted before, the relationship between investments and rate base that attract, the ongoing support for those investments is offset in some ways in a couple of ways by regulatory lag, continued O&M growth that gets picked up in rate cases that don't have quite the same effect as the trackers have. A bit of conservatism in our outlook and then over the long-term, the need to finance that in a balanced way. That story remains the same today. I will ask Donald to touch on the effect of bonus. As we've noted, our guidance remains the same for the year and our growth guidance remains the same but a little bit of insight about the relationship the bonus depreciation would be helpful."

And so think about the bonus depreciation on our rate base, it certainly has a detrimental impact over our plan years, and we typically look out 4 to 5 years. And so what we've done to offset that is to increase our capital spend a little bit over the next couple of years to offset the impact of the rate base. But then when you look at it over a 4, 5-year period, we actually do have positive cash flows through the period. If you remember, we've got NOLs that, before this extension of bonus depreciation, went out through 2018. With this extension of bonus depreciation, our NOL will now go out to -- the end of 2022. So from a cash standpoint, as the detriment early with the bonus depreciation because of the NOL position but on the back end of the year, we do have a cash pick up. And so with the cash, we'll spend in the next couple of years to offset the rate base degradation, we'll  come out with slightly ahead over kind of a 5 or 6-year period. So I think all in all, we're looking at staying within that range. It doesn't challenge our earnings growth story. And at the same time, I think as Joe talked a little bit about conservatism, we understand we're in [indiscernible] rate cases at any time. There's certainly some risk from an amount realized as well as just the timing of when rates are going to affect, and so trying to balance out the understanding of the risk of both, kind of regulatory mechanisms as well as kind of O&M, which doesn't go into the trackers. We feel confident we'll certainly be in the range. But obviously, we'll  have some opportunities, if everything goes the right way, to be at the higher end of the range."

We will continue to keep an eye on the Midwest and if we see an opportunity, we'll certainly participate."

As we'll detail on today's call, NiSource is off to a great start in 2016. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our regulated business strategy and sustained track record of delivering improved service for our customers through our utility and investment programs. We continue to execute on our infrastructure investment strategy, which is designed to improve safety, reliability and environmental performance for our customers and communities. NiSource also made significant progress on several regulatory initiatives supporting these investments as well as enhanced employee training and customer programs. 
Today, we'll briefly cover our first quarter 2016 results before discussing specific operational and regulatory highlights. We'll also touch on how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth before opening the call for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 3 of our supplemental deck, let's now highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.60 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.57 in the same period in 2015. We are well positioned to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings within our 2016 guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share. And with a strong start to the construction season, we're on track to execute on more than $1.4 billion in utility infrastructure investments planned for the year. 
Violet Sistovaris and our NIPSCO team reached settlement agreements with key stakeholders in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. And our Columbia Gas teams led by Carl Levander, filed base rate cases in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and we received regulatory approval of gas system modernization plan updates in Indiana, Massachusetts and Ohio. On the organizational front, we announced changes aimed at further advancing our growth plan and enhancing performance. Pablo Vegas joined NiSource today as President of our Columbia Gas Group. He will oversee the 6 Columbia Gas companies, including leadership of state, regulatory, customer and stakeholder performance, as well as customer service, billing and new business platforms for all 7 NiSource companies. 
Pablo most recently served as President and Chief Operating Officer of AEP Ohio. With Pablo's appointment and the planned retirement of our human resources leader, Rob Campbell, Chief Regulatory Officer, Carl Levander, assumes the role of Executive Vice President, Regulatory Policy and Corporate Affairs, which includes responsibility for policy, corporate communications, federal government affairs, regulatory strategy and human resources at NiSource. I'll talk more about the significant progress across all our businesses later in the call, but first, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Donald?"
292092,330856785,970923,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $191 million or $0.60 per share in the quarter compared with about $179 million or $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On an operati",499,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $191 million or $0.60 per share in the quarter compared with about $179 million or $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $399 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $35 million over the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $180 million for the quarter versus about $193 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments for the first quarter of 2016. Our gas distribution operations segment delivered about $330 million compared with about $306 million in 2015. Net revenue, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by nearly $35 million, primarily attributable to increases in regulatory and service program, including the impact of new rates in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, as well as the implementation of the new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's approved infrastructure replacement program. 
Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by $10.3 million, primarily due to increased outside service costs and higher depreciation. Our electric operations reported about $72 million compared with about $67 million for 2015. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were essentially flat. And operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by $4.8 million, primarily due to lower generation expenses, decreased employee and administrative costs and lower environmental expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher outside service costs. 
As Joe mentioned, our first quarter results positioned NiSource well to deliver net operating earnings within our guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share for the year. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7 billion, with a weighted average maturity and long-term debt of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.72%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015. On March 31, we executed a 3-year $500 million term loan agreement, with the pricing of LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In utilizing the delayed draw feature, we have until the end of September to borrow the full $500 million. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of more than $1 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And our credit rating at the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment-grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued execution and growth. Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

We began 2016 by building upon the positive momentum that we've gained in recent years and maintaining our sharp focus on serving our customers and communities. For instance, in March, we became a founding member of the U.S. EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. Through our 5-year program commitment, NiSource will continue to replace cast iron and various steel pipelines remaining in our natural gas system. Since 2005, we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 23%. As part of our planned investments, we expect to further reduce methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet, a reduction of 10% compared to 2015. 
In addition to helping reduce emissions, our well-established infrastructure modernization programs are producing other meaningful benefits and adding value for our customers. For example, we have reduced gas leaks on our mains by 9% and by 14% on our service lines over the past 5 years. This builds on the safety and reliability of our system. And we've continued to receive recognition for doing business the right way. In March, NiSource was named, for the fifth consecutive year, as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Ethisphere honors companies for leading and promoting ethical business standards in key categories, which include ethics and compliance programs. This designation demonstrates our commitment to serving our customers with integrity and the highest of ethical business standards. 
Now let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on Slide 6. On March 18, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to adjust its base rates in support of the company's continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure and other programs to enhance pipeline safety. If approved as filed, the case would result in $55 million annual revenue increase. An order is expected by the end of 2016. On April 20, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacement rider. The rider provides for continued support of the company's well-established pipeline replacement program investments. This order authorizes an increase of about $21 million in annual revenue related to 2015 infrastructure investments of about $185 million. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million long-term gas system modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. 
On March 30, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved the semiannual tracker update that was filed in August 2015, with additional revenues of $7.6 million, which covered approximately $74 million of investments through mid-2015. NIPSCO filed its latest semiannual tracker update on February 29, which remains pending with the IURC. 
On April 29, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability of its distribution system and to accommodate increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected by early 2017. A decision on Columbia Gas of Massachusetts 2016 Gas System Enhancement Plan was issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on April 29. This approval allows for a recovery of investments through 2016 and will increase annual revenues by approximately $8.2 million, beginning May 1. On April 15, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates so it can support the continued replacement of aging pipe as well as adopt pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6.5 million. A commission order is expected by the end of 2016. And finally, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, on April 27, filed notice with the Kentucky Public Service Commission that it intends to file a request to adjust its base rates to support continued infrastructure investments. 
Now let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 7. On March 24, NIPSCO reached a settlement agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, industrial customers, the LaPorte County Board of Commissioners and the Indiana Municipal Utility Group on the company's 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan. This plan includes more than $1.2 billion of transmission and distribution investments designed to improve system safety and reliability. An IURC order on the settlement is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. NIPSCO also reached an agreement in its electric base rate case currently pending before the IURC. The February 19 settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments in service improvements for customers. The proposed settlement agreement would increase annual revenues by $72.5 million. An IURC order is anticipated early in the third quarter of 2016. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway on both projects. NIPSCO expects to provide updated project cost estimates prior to the commencement of line construction later this year. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to touch on our financial and growth commitments as well as how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014. As we've outlined previously, we expect to deliver net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10, and to make more than $1.4 billion in planned infrastructure investments in 2016. This 2016 earnings and investment guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%, which we first announced a year ago in anticipation of the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group. As we execute on our well-established plans, we're aligning our organization to capitalize on all of our strategic opportunities, including our infrastructure investment plans while, at the same time, looking at enhancements to our plan such as growing our customer base, improving service to our customers and driving enhanced performance through the increased use of common platforms. These emerging elements of our plan are expected to enhance our existing best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Skylar?"

So how do we -- obviously, that's very enticing, and it seems like -- there seems like there's a lot of cushion in there. But you first gave that well before the bonus depreciation rules were extended for 5 years. So can you tell us about how that may have moved things around inside the guidance range? It still seems like you're well positioned to, at the minimum, hit the high end of the earnings guidance range, but maybe the rate base growth is less robust because of bonus d and what you might do to offset that."

I'll ask Donald to touch on the bonus and the relative impact on rate base and how we're navigating through that, but let me take this sort of the higher-level question about the relationship between our outlook, our guidance and our business plan. We think and firmly believe that one of the strengths of the NiSource story is the long-term visibility, the sustained investment platform we have that we outlined, as we noted, a couple of years ago with the $30 billion in investment. As we look through the future and the strong support we have across all 7 states for those kind of investments, that's a great engine for driving growth, the visibility. And I wanted to be sure that we put out a fairly long-term look at earnings guidance in that 4% to 6% annual growth range. We remain committed to that. As we've noted before, the relationship between investments and rate base that are tracked, the ongoing support for those investments is offset in some ways, in a couple of ways, by regulatory lag, continued O&M growth that gets picked up in rate cases that don't have quite the same effect as the trackers have. A bit of conservatism in our outlook and then, over the long term, the need to finance that in a balanced way. That story remains the same today. I will ask Donald to touch on the effect of bonus. As we've noted, our guidance remains the same for the year and our growth guidance remains the same, but a little bit of insight about the relationship of bonus depreciation would be helpful."

And so think about the bonus depreciation on our rate base, it certainly has a detrimental impact over our plan, years, and we typically look out 4 to 5 years. And so what we've done to offset that is to increase our capital spend a little bit over the next couple of years to offset the impact of the rate base. But then when you look at it over a 4-, 5-year period, we actually do have positive cash flows through the period. If you'll remember, we've got NOLs that, before this extension of bonus depreciation, went out through 2018. With this extension of bonus depreciation, our NOL will now go out to -- the end of 2022. So from a cash standpoint, as the detriment early with the bonus depreciation because of the NOL position but on the back end of the year, we do have a cash pickup. And so with the cash we'll spend in the next couple of years to offset the rate base degradation, we'll come out slightly ahead over kind of a 5- or 6-year period. So I think all in all, we're looking at staying within that range. It doesn't challenge our earnings growth story. And at the same time, I think as Joe talked a little bit about conservatism, we understand we're in multiple rate cases at any time. There's certainly some risk from amount realized as well as just the timing of when rates go into effect, and so trying to balance out the understanding of the risk of both kind of regulatory mechanisms as well as kind of O&M, which doesn't go into the trackers. We feel confident we'll certainly be in the range, but, obviously, have some opportunities if everything goes the right way to be at the higher end of the range."

As we'll detail on today's call, NiSource is off to a great start in 2016. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our regulated business strategy and sustained track record of delivering improved service for our customers through our utility and investment programs. We continue to execute on our infrastructure investment strategy, which is designed to improve safety, reliability and environmental performance for our customers and communities. NiSource also made significant progress on several regulatory initiatives supporting these investments as well as enhanced employee training and customer programs. 
Today, we'll briefly cover our first quarter 2016 results before discussing specific operational and regulatory highlights. We'll also touch on how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth before opening the call for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 3 of our supplemental deck, let's now highlight a few key takeaways for the quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.60 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.57 in the same period in 2015. We are well positioned to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings within our 2016 guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share. And with a strong start to the construction season, we're on track to execute on more than $1.4 billion in utility infrastructure investments planned for the year. 
Violet Sistovaris and our NIPSCO team reached settlement agreements with key stakeholders in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. And our Columbia Gas teams led by Carl Levander, filed base rate cases in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and we received regulatory approval of gas system modernization plan updates in Indiana, Massachusetts and Ohio. On the organizational front, we announced changes aimed at further advancing our growth plan and enhancing performance. Pablo Vegas joined NiSource today as President of our Columbia Gas Group. He will oversee the 6 Columbia Gas companies, including leadership of state, regulatory, customer and stakeholder performance, as well as customer service, billing and new business platforms for all 7 NiSource companies. 
Pablo most recently served as President and Chief Operating Officer of AEP Ohio. With Pablo's appointment and the planned retirement of our human resources leader, Rob Campbell, Chief Regulatory Officer, Carl Levander, assumes the role of Executive Vice President, Regulatory Policy and Corporate Affairs, which includes responsibility for policy, corporate communications, federal government affairs, regulatory strategy and human resources at NiSource. I'll talk more about the significant progress across all our businesses later in the call, but first, I'd like to turn the call over to Donald to review our financial results in more detail, which are highlighted on Page 4 of our supplemental slides. Donald?"
292092,330856785,971094,"NiSource Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","NiSource Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $191 million or $0.60 per share in the quarter compared with about $179 million or $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On an operati",499,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $191 million or $0.60 per share in the quarter compared with about $179 million or $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $399 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $35 million over the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $180 million for the quarter versus about $193 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating earnings performance of our 2 utility business segments for the first quarter of 2016. Our gas distribution operations segment delivered about $330 million compared with about $306 million in 2015. Net revenue, excluding the impact of trackers, were up by nearly $35 million, primarily attributable to increases in regulatory and service program, including the impact of new rates in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, as well as the implementation of the new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's approved infrastructure replacement program. 
Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, increased by $10.3 million, primarily due to increased outside service costs and higher depreciation. Our electric operations reported about $72 million compared with about $67 million for 2015. Net revenues, excluding the impact of trackers, were essentially flat. And operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, decreased by $4.8 million, primarily due to lower generation expenses, decreased employee and administrative costs and lower environmental expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher outside service costs. 
As Joe mentioned, our first quarter results positioned NiSource well to deliver net operating earnings within our guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per share for the year. Full details of our results are available in our earnings release issued and posted online this morning. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of March 31 was about $7 billion, with a weighted average maturity and long-term debt of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.72%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015. On March 31, we executed a 3-year $500 million term loan agreement, with the pricing of LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In utilizing the delayed draw feature, we have until the end of September to borrow the full $500 million. At the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of more than $1 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And our credit rating at the 3 major agencies remain solidly investment-grade, something we remain committed to as we continue to execute on our $30 billion and 100% regulated infrastructure investment opportunities. Going forward, our financial foundation is strong and poised for continued execution and growth. Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure and regulatory highlights across our utilities."

We began 2016 by building upon the positive momentum that we've gained in recent years and maintaining our sharp focus on serving our customers and communities. For instance, in March, we became a founding member of the U.S. EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. Through our 5-year program commitment, NiSource will continue to replace cast iron and various steel pipelines remaining in our natural gas system. Since 2005, we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 23%. As part of our planned investments, we expect to further reduce methane emissions by more than 300 million cubic feet, a reduction of 10% compared to 2015. 
In addition to helping reduce emissions, our well-established infrastructure modernization programs are producing other meaningful benefits and adding value for our customers. For example, we have reduced gas leaks on our mains by 9% and by 14% on our service lines over the past 5 years. This builds on the safety and reliability of our system. And we've continued to receive recognition for doing business the right way. In March, NiSource was named, for the fifth consecutive year, as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. Ethisphere honors companies for leading and promoting ethical business standards in key categories, which include ethics and compliance programs. This designation demonstrates our commitment to serving our customers with integrity and the highest of ethical business standards. 
Now let's turn to a few recent highlights in our gas operations on Slide 6. On March 18, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania filed a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to adjust its base rates in support of the company's continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure and other programs to enhance pipeline safety. If approved as filed, the case would result in $55 million annual revenue increase. An order is expected by the end of 2016. On April 20, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Columbia Gas of Ohio's annual infrastructure replacement rider. The rider provides for continued support of the company's well-established pipeline replacement program investments. This order authorizes an increase of about $21 million in annual revenue related to 2015 infrastructure investments of about $185 million. At NIPSCO Gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million long-term gas system modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. 
On March 30, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved the semiannual tracker update that was filed in August 2015, with additional revenues of $7.6 million, which covered approximately $74 million of investments through mid-2015. NIPSCO filed its latest semiannual tracker update on February 29, which remains pending with the IURC. 
On April 29, Columbia Gas of Virginia filed a request with the Virginia State Corporation Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability of its distribution system and to accommodate increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected by early 2017. A decision on Columbia Gas of Massachusetts 2016 Gas System Enhancement Plan was issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on April 29. This approval allows for a recovery of investments through 2016 and will increase annual revenues by approximately $8.2 million, beginning May 1. On April 15, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates so it can support the continued replacement of aging pipe as well as adopt pipeline safety upgrades. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $6.5 million. A commission order is expected by the end of 2016. And finally, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, on April 27, filed notice with the Kentucky Public Service Commission that it intends to file a request to adjust its base rates to support continued infrastructure investments. 
Now let's turn to our electric operations on Slide 7. On March 24, NIPSCO reached a settlement agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, industrial customers, the LaPorte County Board of Commissioners and the Indiana Municipal Utility Group on the company's 7-year electric infrastructure modernization plan. This plan includes more than $1.2 billion of transmission and distribution investments designed to improve system safety and reliability. An IURC order on the settlement is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. NIPSCO also reached an agreement in its electric base rate case currently pending before the IURC. The February 19 settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO's continued investments in service improvements for customers. The proposed settlement agreement would increase annual revenues by $72.5 million. An IURC order is anticipated early in the third quarter of 2016. NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. The 100-mile 345-kV and 65-mile 765-kV projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway on both projects. NIPSCO expects to provide updated project cost estimates prior to the commencement of line construction later this year. 
Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to touch on our financial and growth commitments as well as how we're positioning NiSource for continued growth. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014. As we've outlined previously, we expect to deliver net operating earnings per share of $1 to $1.10, and to make more than $1.4 billion in planned infrastructure investments in 2016. This 2016 earnings and investment guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%, which we first announced a year ago in anticipation of the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group. As we execute on our well-established plans, we're aligning our organization to capitalize on all of our strategic opportunities, including our infrastructure investment plans while, at the same time, looking at enhancements to our plan such as growing our customer base, improving service to our customers and driving enhanced performance through the increased use of common platforms. These emerging elements of our plan are expected to enhance our existing best-in-class, risk-adjusted total return proposition. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Skylar?"

Vast majority of your -- are covered by riders. And you've got this sort of 4% to 6% long-term earnings guidance drive out there. But the rate base growth guidance range is 6% to 8%. So how do we -- obviously, that's very enticing, and it seems like -- there seems like there's a lot of cushion in there. But you first gave that well before the bonus depreciation rules were extended for 5 years. So can you tell us about how that may have moved things around inside the guidance range? It still seems like you're well positioned to, at the minimum, hit the high end of the earnings guidance range, but maybe the rate base growth is less robust because of bonus d and what you might do to offset that."

I'll ask Donald to touch on the bonus and the relative impact on rate base and how we're navigating through that, but let me take this sort of the higher-level question about the relationship between our outlook, our guidance and our business plan. We think and firmly believe that one of the strengths of the NiSource story is the long-term visibility, the sustained investment platform we have that we outlined, as we noted, a couple of years ago with the $30 billion in investment. As we look through the future and the strong support we have across all 7 states for those kind of investments, that's a great engine for driving growth, the visibility. And I wanted to be sure that we put out a fairly long-term look at earnings guidance in that 4% to 6% annual growth range. We remain committed to that. As we've noted before, the relationship between investments and rate base that are tracked, the ongoing support for those investments is offset in some ways, in a couple of ways, by regulatory lag, continued O&M growth that gets picked up in rate cases that don't have quite the same effect as the trackers have. A bit of conservatism in our outlook and then, over the long term, the need to finance that in a balanced way. That story remains the same today. I will ask Donald to touch on the effect of bonus. As we've noted, our guidance remains the same for the year and our growth guidance remains the same, but a little bit of insight about the relationship of bonus depreciation would be helpful."

And so think about the bonus depreciation on our rate base, it certainly has a detrimental impact over our plan, years, and we typically look out 4 to 5 years. And so what we've done to offset that is to increase our capital spend a little bit over the next couple of years to offset the impact of the rate base. But then when you look at it over a 4-, 5-year period, we actually do have positive cash flows through the period. If you'll remember, we've got NOLs that, before this extension of bonus depreciation, went out through 2018. With this extension of bonus depreciation, our NOL will now go out to -- the end of 2022. So from a cash standpoint, as the detriment early with the bonus depreciation because of the NOL position but on the back end of the year, we do have a cash pickup. And so with the cash we'll spend in the next couple of years to offset the rate base degradation, we'll come out slightly ahead over kind of a 5- or 6-year period. So I think all in all, we're looking at staying within that range. It doesn't challenge our earnings growth story. And at the same time, I think as Joe talked a little bit about conservatism, we understand we're in multiple rate cases at any time. There's certainly some risk from amount realized as well as just the timing of when rates go into effect, and so trying to balance out the understanding of the risk of both kind of regulatory mechanisms as well as kind of O&M, which doesn't go into the trackers. We feel confident we'll certainly be in the range, but, obviously, have some opportunities if everything goes the right way to be at the higher end of the range."

And thanks for joining us. Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides.

And thanks for joining us. Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides. With 12 months of execution behind us since the separation of our interstate pipeline business, NiSource is well-positioned as a premier pure-play regulated utility with a solid long-term business plan based on large-scale infrastructure modernization programs. Since well before the separation, we've been building momentum executing our electric and gas investment regulatory programs while financing our focus on customer service across our 7 states. I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right plan and the right team in place to deliver on the commitments we've outlined for customers and shareholders.
Reflecting that confidence, on the strength of our first 6 months of performance in 2016 and recent execution highlights, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings for 2016 of $1.05 to $1.10 per share, a narrowing of our $1 to $1.10 guidance that we originally announced about 15 months ago. 
And now to our results for the second quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.08 per share. With strong execution of our construction program and in partaking advantage of favorable weather, we now expect to make nearly $1.5 billion of utility infrastructure investments in 2016. These well-established programs across our footprint are improving safety, reliability, service and environmental performance, for our customers and communities.
Highlighting our continued regulatory progress, in July, we received commission approval on both the NIPSCO electric base rate case and long-term electric infrastructure modernization programs. And our regulatory activity at our Columbia companies remains on schedule with rate cases in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania on track for expected commission orders by the end of the year by the Virginia to follow closely behind in early 2017.
Notably, we reached a settlement in Maryland just last week. We'll talk more about each of these in a few minutes. 
Supplementing the value delivered to our ongoing is from structure strategy is a strong, sustainable and growing dividends, which we continue to project will increase by 4% to 6% each year. And on May 11, we delivered on that commitment by increasing our annualized dividend by 6.5%. Our credit ratings are stable, and improving and our liquidity position remains solid at $619 million. And just last month, Fitch upgrades its rating of NiSource from BBB- to BBB, and we maintained our investment-grade rating of BBB+ and Baa2 with stable outlooks at Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively.
As you can see, strong performance continued in the second quarter with additional progress already in place for the third quarter. Let's turn the call to Donald to review our financial results in more detail. You can find those on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment on financial information available in the investors section of nisource.com. Donald?"

As Joe mentioned, we delivered second quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $26 million or $0.08 per share compared with about $1 million or $0.00 per share in 2015.
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $134 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $32 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $29 million for the quarter versus a loss of about $73 million in the second quarter of 2015. The biggest drivers of our performance continue to be the impact of our long-term regulatory program and infrastructure investments.
Our GAAP distribution operations delivered operating earnings of about $73 million, an increase of more than $17 million primarily attributable to new base rate at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure related -- replacement program. Our electric operations reported operating earnings of about $64 million, an increase of more than $7 million, primarily attributable to increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments.
While Joe mentioned it earlier, I wanted to reiterate that we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $7.3 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.7%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $619 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I wanted to flag for you our latest sustainability report, which was published in June. The report highlights how we're delivering on our commitments safety, customer satisfaction, system enhancement, and being recognized among the best places to work. The report provides stakeholders with a glimpse into our continued sustainability efforts, a key component of our business plan. This report is available at nisource.com. And a significant enhancement for our customers was introduced in May, a redesigned bill across our 7 states. The new bill format features user-friendly updates to make it easier to read and understand. Consistent with our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders, customer feedback was a key input into the design of the new bill. 
So let's turn to some highlight from our gas operations on Slide 6. At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year of approximately $800 million gas investor modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety.
Supporting this investment, on June 22, the Indiana utility regulatory commission order IURC approved the company's semiannual tracker update. this updated covered an incremental $72 million of investments through the end of 2015 and will increase annual revenues by $6.7 million.
On May 27, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to address its base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with ongoing initiatives to improve system safety and reliability.
If approved as filed, this case would increase annual revenues by about $25 million. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania base rate case as Brazil schedule with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The case 6 to adjust base rates in support of our continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure and to recover increase as an safety-related operating and maintenance cost and because also includes in its provisions for customer growth. If approved as filed, the case would result in a $55 million in all of increase.
I would note that productive settlement discussions are taking place in this case.
Also Pennsylvania, we opened our first hope of four a centralized employee training centers. The $10 million, 22,000 square foot, facility, includes simulators of safety down and other hands-on training designed to help develop our next-generation of talent. This is an exciting investment that supports long-term sustainability be helping us attract and retain som of the best talent in the industry. Other facilities are in the planning stages in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts.
Columbia Gas of Virginia this week's remains pending before the Virginia state Corporation commission. Request seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability and to enable increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million.
At Columbia Gas of Maryland, the company on July 27, filed a joint settlement agreement in its base rate case for the staff of the Maryland Public Service Commission and the Maryland office of people's counsel. The proposed settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions that encourage customer growth. The case filed in April 6 to adjust its base rates to support the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. New rates are expected to be in effect in November 2016. We expect commissions positions in Pennsylvania In kentucky by the end of the year and again in Virginia in early 2017.
As you can see, our teams are successfully executing all phases of our plan, and you'll see similar things at our electric business. Now let's turn to Slide 7. As a mentioned, at the start of the call, the NIPSCO team reached significant milestones with commission approval of settlement in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. On July 18, the IURC approved an agreement that NIPSCO reached with key stakeholders in its electric base rate case. The approved settlement agreement provides a platform for continued investment in service improvements. New rates go into effect on October 1, and will increase annual revenues by $72.5 million.
And on July 12, the IURC approved budget Max 7 year electric infrastructure modernization program settlement. With more than $1.2 billion our planned investments, the IURC decision provides a clear path to continue making the necessary upgrades to our electric infrastructure in northern Indiana, now and into the future.
And last but not least, NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance regionwide system flexibility and reliability. Right away acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway for both projects with construction in its early stages.
And before opening the call to questions, I'd like to touch on our ongoing commitment. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on our $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments, the company outlined in 2014.
These system modernization plans continue to deliver value for all stakeholders across our 7 states.
Our capital investment plan for 2016 has been updated from approximately $1.4 billion to nearly $1.5 billion driven by our teams high performance execution and supported by favorable weather conditions for construction so far this year.
As we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, we've focused our earnings guidance for the year now expected delivery non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10.
While we are not yet providing guidance or investment plans for 2017, this 2016 earnings guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%.
I'm pretty clearly proud of our employees. Through their talent and dedication to serving our customers, we are delivering on our commitments, which are focused on industry-leading safety performance in top-tier customer service. Our balanced and constructive strategy is designed to sustain performance and continue delivering on these commitments well into the future. Think of all property Spain today, and for your ongoing interest and NiSource. We look forward is sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Michelle?"

Recently, having begun to implement some of our pilot programs in Indiana and Pennsylvania. They represent enhanced focus on growth opportunities and outreach for not getting any measurable the back off those enhanced strategies. Probably more notably, as I said in a number of the rate case updates, our regulatory strategy has been focused in part on financing the ability to attract new customers with programs that support the upfront belief on the upfront cost for new customers or conversion customers we've seen support for that cause most of the jurisdictions of your today, as we stand here, on a gross basis, so we often talk of attrition on the customer count as well. But on a gross basis, we're running about 10% ahead of where we were at this time last year, driven predominantly by and this varies across our territory but by strong housing starts in certain parts of the territory, notably in Virginia. We've seen strong surges and construction and opportunities for growth there. And in conversion, fuel conversion again in Massachusetts where that's been strong. Year-on-year about 10% growth. Keeping in mind we have -- tat offsets that. We're just beginning to see a slight uptick in our growth rates, too early to tell if that's going to carry on through the balance of the year but I'm optimistic."

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides. With 12 months of execution behind us since the separation of our interstate pipeline business, NiSource is well-positioned as a premier pure-play regulated utility with a solid long-term business plan based on large-scale infrastructure modernization programs. Since well before the separation, we've been building momentum executing our electric and gas investment and regulatory programs while enhancing our focus on customer service across our 7 states. I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right plan and the right team in place to deliver on the commitments we've outlined for customers and shareholders.
Reflecting that confidence on the strength of our first 6 months of performance in 2016 and recent execution highlights, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings for 2016 of $1.05 to $1.10 per share, a narrowing of our $1 to $1.10 guidance that we originally announced about 15 months ago. 
And now to our results for the second quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.08 per share. With strong execution of our construction program and in partaking advantage of favorable weather, we now expect to make nearly $1.5 billion of utility infrastructure investments in 2016. These well-established programs across our footprint are improving safety, reliability, service and environmental performance for our customers and communities.
Highlighting our continued regulatory progress, in July, we received commission approval on both the NIPSCO electric base rate case and long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. And our regulatory activity at our Columbia companies remains on schedule with rate cases in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania on track for expected commission orders by the end of the year, with Virginia to follow closely behind in early 2017.
Notably, we reached a settlement in Maryland just last week. We'll talk more about each of these in a few minutes. 
Supplementing the value delivered to our ongoing infrastructure strategy is a strong, sustainable and growing dividend, which we continue to project will increase by 4% to 6% each year. And on May 11, we delivered on that commitment by increasing our annualized dividend by 6.5%. Our credit ratings are stable and improving, and our liquidity position remains solid at $619 million. And just last month, Fitch upgraded its rating of NiSource from BBB- to BBB, and we maintained our investment-grade rating of BBB+ and Baa2 with stable outlooks at Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively.
As you can see, strong performance continued in the second quarter, with additional progress already in place for the third quarter. Let's turn the call to Donald to review our financial results in more detail. You can find those on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment in financial information available in the investors section of nisource.com. Donald?"

As Joe mentioned, we delivered second quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $26 million or $0.08 per share compared with about $1 million or $0.00 per share in 2015.
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $134 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $32 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $29 million for the quarter versus a loss of about $73 million in the second quarter of 2015. The biggest drivers of our performance continue to be the impact of our long-term regulatory program and infrastructure investments.
Our GAAP distribution operations delivered operating earnings of about $73 million, an increase of more than $17 million, primarily attributable to new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure related -- replacement program. Our electric operations reported operating earnings of about $64 million, an increase of more than $7 million, primarily attributable to increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments.
While Joe mentioned it earlier, I wanted to reiterate that we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $7.3 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.7%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $619 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I wanted to flag for you our latest Sustainability Report, which was published in June.

Before getting into those details, I wanted to flag for you our latest Sustainability Report, which was published in June. The report highlights how we're delivering on our commitments to safety, customer satisfaction, system enhancements and being recognized among the best places to work. The report provides stakeholders with a glimpse into our continued sustainability efforts, a key component of our business plan. This report is available at nisource.com. And a significant enhancement for our customers was introduced in May, a redesigned bill across our 7 states. The new bill format features user-friendly updates to make it easier to read and understand. Consistent with our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders, customer feedback was a key input into the design of the new bill. 
So let's turn to some highlights from our gas operations on Slide 6. At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety.
Supporting this investment, on June 22, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved the company's semiannual tracker update. This update covered an incremental $72 million of investments through the end of 2015 and will increase annual revenues by $6.7 million.
On May 27, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other cost associated with ongoing initiatives to improve system safety and reliability.
If approved as filed, this case would increase annual revenues by about $25 million. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The case seeks to adjust base rates in support of our continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure and to recover increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The case includes enhanced provisions for customer growth. If approved as filed, the case would result in a $55 million annual revenue increase. I would note that productive settlement discussions are taking place in this case.
Also in Pennsylvania, we opened our first of 4 centralized employee training centers. The $10 million, 22,000 square foot facility includes simulators, a safety town and other hands-on training designed to help develop our next-generation of talent. This is an exciting investment that supports long-term sustainability by helping us attract and retain some of the best talent in the industry. Other facilities are in the planning stages in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts.
Columbia Gas of Virginia's base rate case remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other cost associated with ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability, and to enable increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million.
At Columbia Gas of Maryland, the company, on July 27, filed a joint settlement agreement in its base rate case with the staff of the Maryland Public Service Commission and the Maryland office of People's Counsel. The proposed settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. The case, filed in April, seeks to adjust base rates to support the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. New rates are expected to be in effect in November 2016. We expect commission decisions in Pennsylvania and Kentucky by the end of the year, and again, in Virginia in early 2017.  As you can see, our teams are successfully executing all phases of our plan, and you'll see similar things at our electric business. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7. As I mentioned at the start of the call, the NIPSCO team reached significant milestones with commission approval of settlements in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. On July 18, the IURC approved an agreement that NIPSCO reached with key stakeholders in its electric base rate case. The approved settlement agreement provides a platform for continued investments in service improvements. New rates go into effect on October 1, and will increase annual revenues by $72.5 million.
And on July 12, the IURC approved a NIPSCO 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program settlement. With more than $1.2 billion of planned investments, the IURC's decision provides a clear path to continue making the necessary upgrades to our electric infrastructure in northern Indiana, now and into the future.
And last but not least, NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway for both projects with line construction in its early stages.
And before opening the call to questions, I'd like to touch on our ongoing commitment. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on our $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014.
These system modernization plans continue to deliver value for all stakeholders across our 7 states.
Our capital investment plan for 2016 has been updated from approximately $1.4 billion to nearly $1.5 billion driven by our team's high performance execution and supported by favorable weather conditions for construction so far this year.
As we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, we've focused our earnings guidance for the year and now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10.
While we are not yet providing guidance or investment plans for 2017, this 2016 earnings guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%.
I'm particularly proud of our employees. Through their talent and dedication to serving our customers, we're delivering on our commitments, which are focused on industry-leading safety performance and top-tier customer service. Our balanced and constructive strategy is designed to sustain performance and continue delivering on these commitments well into the future. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Michelle?"

As you noted, we are at the very, very early stages of implementation of some of our enhanced growth strategies, recently having begun to implement some of our pilot programs in Indiana and Pennsylvania. They represent enhanced focus on growth opportunities and outreach. So not yet seeing any measurable impact of those enhanced strategies. Probably, more notably, as I said in a number of the rate case updates, our regulatory strategy has been focused in part on enhancing the ability to attract new customers with programs that support the upfront -- belief on the upfront cost for new customers or conversion customers. We're seeing support for that across most of the jurisdictions of -- year-to-date, as we stand here, we are -- on a gross basis, so we often talk of attrition on in the customer count as well. But on a gross basis, we're running about 10% ahead of where we were at this time last year, driven predominantly by -- and this varies across our territory but by strong housing starts in certain parts of the territory, notably in Virginia. We've seen strong surges in construction and opportunities for growth there. And in conversion -- fuel conversion, again in Massachusetts, where that's been strong. Year-on-year about 10% growth keeping in mind we have attrition that offsets that. We're just beginning to see a slight uptick in our growth rates. So too early to tell if that's going to carry on through the balance of the year, but I'm optimistic."

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides. With 12 months of execution behind us since the separation of our interstate pipeline business, NiSource is well-positioned as a premier pure-play regulated utility with a solid long-term business plan based on large-scale infrastructure modernization programs. Since well before the separation, we've been building momentum executing our electric and gas investment and regulatory programs while enhancing our focus on customer service across our 7 states. I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right plan and the right team in place to deliver on the commitments we've outlined for customers and shareholders.
Reflecting that confidence on the strength of our first 6 months of performance in 2016 and recent execution highlights, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings for 2016 of $1.05 to $1.10 per share, a narrowing of our $1 to $1.10 guidance that we originally announced about 15 months ago. 
And now to our results for the second quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.08 per share. With strong execution of our construction program and in partaking advantage of favorable weather, we now expect to make nearly $1.5 billion of utility infrastructure investments in 2016. These well-established programs across our footprint are improving safety, reliability, service and environmental performance for our customers and communities.
Highlighting our continued regulatory progress, in July, we received commission approval on both the NIPSCO electric base rate case and long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. And our regulatory activity at our Columbia companies remains on schedule with rate cases in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania on track for expected commission orders by the end of the year, with Virginia to follow closely behind in early 2017.
Notably, we reached a settlement in Maryland just last week. We'll talk more about each of these in a few minutes. 
Supplementing the value delivered to our ongoing infrastructure strategy is a strong, sustainable and growing dividend, which we continue to project will increase by 4% to 6% each year. And on May 11, we delivered on that commitment by increasing our annualized dividend by 6.5%. Our credit ratings are stable and improving, and our liquidity position remains solid at $619 million. And just last month, Fitch upgraded its rating of NiSource from BBB- to BBB, and we maintained our investment-grade rating of BBB+ and Baa2 with stable outlooks at Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively.
As you can see, strong performance continued in the second quarter, with additional progress already in place for the third quarter. Let's turn the call to Donald to review our financial results in more detail. You can find those on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment in financial information available in the investors section of nisource.com. Donald?"

As Joe mentioned, we delivered second quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $26 million or $0.08 per share compared with about $1 million or $0.00 per share in 2015.
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $134 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $32 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $29 million for the quarter versus a loss of about $73 million in the second quarter of 2015. The biggest drivers of our performance continue to be the impact of our long-term regulatory program and infrastructure investments.
Our GAAP distribution operations delivered operating earnings of about $73 million, an increase of more than $17 million, primarily attributable to new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure related -- replacement program. Our electric operations reported operating earnings of about $64 million, an increase of more than $7 million, primarily attributable to increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments.
While Joe mentioned it earlier, I wanted to reiterate that we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $7.3 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.7%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $619 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities.
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

Before getting into those details, I wanted to flag for you our latest Sustainability Report, which was published in June.

Before getting into those details, I wanted to flag for you our latest Sustainability Report, which was published in June. The report highlights how we're delivering on our commitments to safety, customer satisfaction, system enhancements and being recognized among the best places to work. The report provides stakeholders with a glimpse into our continued sustainability efforts, a key component of our business plan. This report is available at nisource.com. And a significant enhancement for our customers was introduced in May, a redesigned bill across our 7 states. The new bill format features user-friendly updates to make it easier to read and understand. Consistent with our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders, customer feedback was a key input into the design of the new bill. 
So let's turn to some highlights from our gas operations on Slide 6. At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety.
Supporting this investment, on June 22, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved the company's semiannual tracker update. This update covered an incremental $72 million of investments through the end of 2015 and will increase annual revenues by $6.7 million.
On May 27, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other cost associated with ongoing initiatives to improve system safety and reliability.
If approved as filed, this case would increase annual revenues by about $25 million. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The case seeks to adjust base rates in support of our continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure and to recover increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The case also includes enhanced provisions for customer growth. If approved as filed, the case would result in a $55 million annual revenue increase. I would note that productive settlement discussions are taking place in this case.
Also in Pennsylvania, we opened our first of 4 centralized employee training centers. The $10 million, 22,000 square foot facility includes simulators, a safety town and other hands-on training designed to help develop our next-generation of talent. This is an exciting investment that supports long-term sustainability by helping us attract and retain some of the best talent in the industry. Other facilities are in the planning stages in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts.
Columbia Gas of Virginia's base rate case remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other cost associated with ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability, and to enable increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million.
At Columbia Gas of Maryland, the company, on July 27, filed a joint settlement agreement in its base rate case with the staff of the Maryland Public Service Commission and the Maryland office of People's Counsel. The proposed settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. The case, filed in April, seeks to adjust base rates to support the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. New rates are expected to be in effect in November 2016. We expect commission decisions in Pennsylvania and Kentucky by the end of the year, and again, in Virginia in early 2017.  As you can see, our teams are successfully executing all phases of our plan, and you'll see similar things at our electric business. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7. As I mentioned at the start of the call, the NIPSCO team reached significant milestones with commission approval of settlements in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. On July 18, the IURC approved an agreement that NIPSCO reached with key stakeholders in its electric base rate case. The approved settlement agreement provides a platform for continued investments in service improvements. New rates go into effect on October 1, and will increase annual revenues by $72.5 million.
And on July 12, the IURC approved a NIPSCO 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program settlement. With more than $1.2 billion of planned investments, the IURC's decision provides a clear path to continue making the necessary upgrades to our electric infrastructure in northern Indiana, now and into the future.
And last but not least, NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway for both projects with line construction in its early stages.
And before opening the call to questions, I'd like to touch on our ongoing commitment. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on our $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014.
These system modernization plans continue to deliver value for all stakeholders across our 7 states.
Our capital investment plan for 2016 has been updated from approximately $1.4 billion to nearly $1.5 billion driven by our team's high performance execution and supported by favorable weather conditions for construction so far this year.
As we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, we've focused our earnings guidance for the year and now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10.
While we are not yet providing guidance or investment plans for 2017, this 2016 earnings guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%.
I'm particularly proud of our employees. Through their talent and dedication to serving our customers, we're delivering on our commitments, which are focused on industry-leading safety performance and top-tier customer service. Our balanced and constructive strategy is designed to sustain performance and continue delivering on these commitments well into the future. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Michelle?"

As you noted, we are at the very, very early stages of implementation of some of our enhanced growth strategies, recently having begun to implement some of our pilot programs in Indiana and Pennsylvania. That represent enhanced focus on growth opportunities and outreach. So not yet seeing any measurable impact of those enhanced strategies. Probably, more notably, as I said in a number of the rate case updates, our regulatory strategy has been focused in part on enhancing the ability to attract new customers with programs that support the upfront -- relief on the upfront cost for new customers or conversion customers. We've seen support for that across most of the jurisdictions of -- year-to-date, as we stand here, we are -- on a gross basis, so we often talk of attrition on the customer count as well. But on a gross basis, we're running about 10% ahead of where we were at this time last year, driven predominantly by -- and this varies across our territory but by strong housing starts in certain parts of the territory, notably in Virginia. We've seen strong surges in construction and opportunities for growth there. And in conversion -- fuel conversion, again in Massachusetts, where that's been strong. Year-on-year about 10% growth keeping in mind we have attrition that offsets that. We're just beginning to see a slight uptick in our growth rates. So too early to tell if that's going to carry on through the balance of the year, but I'm optimistic."

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides.  The NiSource team has continued to execute programs and regulatory initiatives that benefit our customers by enhancing system safety, reliability and customer services, while driving solid financial performance. Based on our results through the first 9 months of the year, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016. 
We are also on pace to complete approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. Based on these strong results and with confidence in our ability to continue executing on our investment program, we are initiating 2017 net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Additionally, we expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion in planned utility infrastructure investments in 2017. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments outlined in 2014. Investments that we expect to drive 4% to 6% long-term annual growth in both net operating earnings and dividend.  With this robust level of investment and steady earnings and dividend growth projected, NiSource remains committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and strong liquidity. 
Let's now turn to our third quarter performance. Starting with the business highlights, we continue to make progress on the regulatory front with settlements approved in our base rate cases at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Maryland. Additionally, a settlement was reached in Columbia Gas of Kentucky's rate case, and interim rates were implemented, while we continue through the regulatory process in Virginia. At NIPSCO electric, updated base rates went into effect last month following a final order approving our settlement reached in July, and our long-term electric generation strategy is advancing. We'll discuss each of these significant milestones in a few minutes.
On the financial side, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.06 per share versus $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Donald will go into a bit more detail on these results, which can be found on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment and financial information available in the Investors section of niSource.com.

As Joe mentioned, we are on pace to meet our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.10 per share non-GAAP. For the third quarter on an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $107 million for the quarter, which is a decrease of about $9 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $114 million for the quarter versus about $110 million in the third quarter of 2015. Annually, the biggest driver continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments. I would note that these investments have a somewhat muted impact each year in the third quarter due to inherent lower seasonal sales in our natural gas business.
On a segment level, our Gas Distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $5 million, a decrease of about $17 million from 2015. This variance was driven primarily by nontrack O&M expenses is about $206 million, which is consistent with a quarterly run rate of about $204 million in the last 3 quarters.  This quarter-over-quarter variance of $18 million was largely attributable to employee-related [indiscernible] and post-separation staffing as well as higher outside service costs, driven by gas compliance and maintenance activity. 
The quarter-over-quarter O&M variance was partially offset by new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio infrastructure replacement program.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $105 million, an increase of about $3 million from 2015.  Similar to the gas segment, Electric Operations nontrack O&M of about $115 million was consistent with the last 3 quarters average of about $115 billion. However, it was about $14 million higher in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter-over-quarter variance in O&M was primarily attributable to increase generate -- generation-related maintenance activities and employee administration costs related to benefit true-ups. This variance was offset by higher revenue from increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments. 
As you can see, solid progress for the year with continued growth projected for the fourth quarter as we continue to execute our capital program and regulatory initiatives.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $7.7 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $677 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And as a reminder, currently Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at Baa2 and Fitch at BBB all with stable outlook. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

I'll start by highlighting some recognition we recently received. In September, NiSource was named the 3rd straight-year to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our sustainable business practices and performance. We're proud of this achievement, a sustainable approach to safety, reliability, customer experience, environmental performance and community engagement is core to our strategy, which delivers values to all of our stakeholders including new [indiscernible]. In order to sustain the company and to continue to execute on our long-term strategies, it is important that we have the right talent in place with the proper skills throughout their career. To support that goal, we are advancing our field training program. The first of 4 new employee training centers featuring modern stimulator hands-on training labs and safety [indiscernible] opened in Pennsylvania in July. This center is expected to serve on average 35 employees per day and provide training for 100  first responders each year.
In August, we broke ground on a similar center in Ohio, and we'll begin construction of a facility in Virginia later this month. In Massachusetts, we expect to break ground on this center next spring. You can learn more about our approach to training and the features of these centers, which are gaining significant industry attention via a link on the homepage of nisource.com. 
In addition to enhancing system safety and reliability, our utility investments are focused on growing our customer base. This summer, we launched pilot programs in Pennsylvania and Indiana with a design to add gas customers through conversions from other fuel sources. The programs include adding [indiscernible] employees who are dedicated to existing customers through the conversion process and interfacing with builders and developers, enhanced marketing, building trade online networks and streamlining internal processes to accommodate customer conversion.  We plan to expand the program to all NiSource states by 2018. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. In Pennsylvania, on October 27, we received Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the company's continued upgrading and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance cost. It will increase annual revenue by $35 million and also include incentives to expand gas services to commercial customers.  New rates will go into effect in December.
And in Virginia, we implemented updated interim base rates subject to refund on September 28. The new rates are part of a base rate case, which remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request speaks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve overall system safety and reliability and to grow the system in response to increasing customer demand for service. [indiscernible] case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected early next year. 
Our base rate case in Kentucky is progressing with a settlement agreement reached with  parties in later October and is being heard by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. 
If approved is filed, the settlement would increase annual revenue by $13.4 million and allow [indiscernible] commission decision is expected by the end of the year. 
And in Maryland, the commission approved the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. And most importantly, it supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. 
In Indiana, at NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. In August, the company filed its semiannual tracker update, covering an additional $57 million of investments made in the first half of 2016. An order by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Other NiSource companies have filed tracker update request in support of their gas infrastructure modernization program. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement Plan and Columbia Gas of Virginia under its SAVE Act, steps to advance Virginia's Energy Plan program. Combined, these filings cover about $110 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability.  As you can see, much progress on the regulatory customer and infrastructure funds, with several things to be resolved before the years end.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. New rates became effective on October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement. The approved settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO continued electric infrastructure investments and service improvements for customers, and it increases the company's annual base rate revenues by about $73 million. NIPSCO is also focused on executing on its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to the electric transmission and distribution system, designed to improve system safety and reliability.
In July, the Indiana Commission approved the settlement related to the program, which allows [ph] to recovery of approximately $1.25 billion of investments being made through 2022. NIPSCO expects to begin recovering on $46 million of these investments, beginning in February 2017.
The company's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower consumption are well underway for both projects.
Finally, NIPSCO will submit its integrated resource plan or IRP to the Indiana Commission later today. The IRP process is conducted by Indiana Electricity providers to outline their plan to meet their customers anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team has worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan, focused on providing customers affordable clean energy, while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes.
The plan remains consistent with the future generation strategy we previewed in August. As outlined in the IRP, NIPSCO today will also file with the IURC for approval to construct required environmental investment at Michigan city and shaper generating facility. 
So before opening the call to questions, I'd like to lift up some key takeaways for the remainder of the year and 2017. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to produce benefits for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016, and we expect 2017 net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Our robust investment plans include approximately $1.5 billion in utility infrastructure investments in 2017. NiSource expects to complete about $1.5 billion in such investments in 2016.
These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified long-term regulated utility investments that we outlined in 2014. And we continue to expect to grow operating earnings and our dividend by 4% to 6% annually, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Finally, while we'll provide more specific details later, I wanted to highlight that we are planning to host an Investor Day sometime in the later part of the first quarter of 2017. This New York event will provide an opportunity for the NiSource team to share a more comprehensive picture of our utility investment strategy. So stay tuned more to come as we confirm the date and details of that event.  Thank you all for participating today, and for your ongoing interest and support of NiSource. 
Now let's open the call to your questions. Vicki?"

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides.  The NiSource team has continued to execute programs and regulatory initiatives that benefit our customers by enhancing system safety, reliability and customer services, while driving solid financial performance. Based on our results through the first 9 months of the year, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016. 
We are also on pace to complete approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. Based on these strong results and with confidence in our ability to continue executing on our investment program, we are initiating 2017 net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Additionally, we expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion in planned utility infrastructure investments in 2017. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments outlined in 2014. Investments that we expect to drive 4% to 6% long-term annual growth in both net operating earnings and dividend.  With this robust level of investment and steady earnings and dividend growth projected, NiSource remains committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and strong liquidity. 
Let's now turn to our third quarter performance. Starting with the business highlights, we continue to make progress on the regulatory front with settlements approved in our base rate cases at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Maryland. Additionally, a settlement was reached in Columbia Gas of Kentucky's rate case, and interim rates were implemented, while we continue through the regulatory process in Virginia. At NIPSCO electric, updated base rates went into effect last month following a final order approving our settlement reached in July, and our long-term electric generation strategy is advancing. We'll discuss each of these significant milestones in a few minutes.
On the financial side, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.06 per share versus $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Donald will go into a bit more detail on these results, which can be found on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment and financial information available in the Investors section of niSource.com.

As Joe mentioned, we are on pace to meet our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.10 per share non-GAAP. For the third quarter on an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $107 million for the quarter, which is a decrease of about $9 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $114 million for the quarter versus about $110 million in the third quarter of 2015. Annually, the biggest driver continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments. I would note that these investments have a somewhat muted impact each year in the third quarter due to inherent lower seasonal sales in our natural gas business.
On a segment level, our Gas Distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $5 million, a decrease of about $17 million from 2015. This variance was driven primarily by nontrack O&M expenses of about $206 million, which is consistent with a quarterly run rate of about $204 million in the last 3 quarters.  This quarter-over-quarter variance of $18 million was largely attributable to employee-related benefits true-up and postseparation staffing as well as higher outside service costs, driven by gas compliance and maintenance activity. 
The quarter-over-quarter O&M variance was partially offset by new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio infrastructure replacement program.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $105 million, an increase of about $3 million from 2015.  Similar to the gas segment, Electric Operations nontrack O&M of about $115 million was consistent with the last 3 quarters average of about $115 billion. However, it was about $14 million higher in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter-over-quarter variance in O&M was primarily attributable to increase generate -- generation-related maintenance activities and employee administration costs related to benefit true-ups. This variance was offset by higher revenue from increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments. 
As you can see, solid progress for the year with continued growth projected for the fourth quarter as we continue to execute our capital program and regulatory initiatives.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $7.7 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $677 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And as a reminder, currently Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at Baa2 and Fitch at BBB all with stable outlook. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

I'll start by highlighting some recognition we recently received. In September, NiSource was named the third straight year to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our sustainable business practices and performance. We're proud of this achievement, a sustainable approach to safety, reliability, customer experience, environmental performance and community engagement is core to our strategy, which delivers values to all of our stakeholders including 2653 [ph] newer investors. In order to sustain the company and to continue to execute on our long-term strategy, it's important that we have the right talent in place with the proper skills throughout their career. To support that goal, we are advancing our field training program. The first of 4 new employee training centers featuring modern stimulators, hands-on training labs and safety towns opened in Pennsylvania in July. This center is expected to serve on average 35 employees per day and provide training for 100  first responders each year.
In August, we broke ground on a similar center in Ohio, and we'll begin construction of a facility in Virginia later this month. In Massachusetts, we expect to break ground on this center next spring. You can learn more about our approach to training and the features of these centers, which are gaining significant industry attention via a link on the homepage of nisource.com. 
In addition to enhancing system safety and reliability, our utility investments are focused on growing our customer base. This summer, we launched pilot programs in Pennsylvania and Indiana with a design to add gas customers through conversions from other fuel sources. The programs include adding field employees who are dedicated to existing customers through the conversion process and interfacing with builders and developers, enhanced marketing, building trade online networks and streamlining internal processes to accommodate customer conversion.  We plan to expand the program to all NiSource states by 2018. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. In Pennsylvania, on October 27, we received Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the company's continued upgrading and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance cost. It will increase annual revenue by $35 million and also include incentives to expand gas services to commercial customers.  New rates will go into effect in December.
And in Virginia, we implemented updated interim base rates subject to refund on September 28. The new rates are part of a base rate case, which remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request speaks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve overall system safety and reliability and to grow the system in response to increasing customer demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected early next year. 
Our base rate case in Kentucky is progressing with a settlement agreement reached with  parties in later October and is being heard by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. 
If approved as filed, the settlement would increase annual revenue by $13.4 million and [indiscernible]. A commission decision is expected by the end of the year. 
And in Maryland, the commission approved the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. And most importantly, it supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. 
In Indiana, at NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. In August, the company filed its semiannual tracker update, covering an additional $57 million of investments made in the first half of 2016. An order by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Other NiSource companies have filed tracker update request in support of their gas infrastructure modernization program. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement Plan and Columbia Gas of Virginia under its SAVE Act, steps to advance Virginia's Energy Plan program. Combined, these filings cover about $110 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability.  As you can see, much progress on the regulatory customer and infrastructure funds, with several things to be resolved before the years end.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. New rates became effective on October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement. The approved settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO continued electric infrastructure investments and service improvements for customers, and it increases the company's annual base rate revenues by about $73 million. NIPSCO is also focused on executing on its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to the electric transmission and distribution system, designed to improve system safety and reliability.
In July, the Indiana Commission approved the settlement related to the program which allows the recovery of approximately $1.25 billion of investments being made through 2022. NIPSCO expects to begin recovering on $46 million of these investments, beginning in February 2017.
The company's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower consumption are well underway for both projects.
Finally, NIPSCO will submit its integrated resource plan or IRP to the Indiana Commission later today. The IRP process is conducted by Indiana Electricity providers to outline their plan to meet their customers anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team has worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan, focused on providing customers affordable clean energy, while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes.
The plan remains consistent with the future generation strategy we previewed in August. As outlined in the IRP, NIPSCO today will also file with the IURC for approval to construct required environmental investment at its Michigan city and Schahfer generating facility. 
So before opening the call to questions, I'd like to lift up some key takeaways for the remainder of the year in 2017. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to produce benefits for customers and communities, while also driving solid financial performance.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016, and we expect 2017 net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Our robust investment plans include approximately $1.5 billion in utility infrastructure investments in 2017. NiSource expects to complete about $1.5 billion in such investments in 2016.
These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified long-term regulated utility investments that we outlined in 2014. And we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 4% to 6% annually, while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Finally, while we'll provide more specific details later, I wanted to highlight that we are planning to host an Investor Day sometime in the later part of the first quarter of 2017. This New York event will provide an opportunity for the NiSource team to share a more comprehensive picture of our utility investment strategy. So stay tuned more to come as we confirm the date and details of that event.  Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides. The NiSource team has continued to execute programs and regulatory initiatives that benefit our customers by enhancing system safety, reliability and customer services, while driving solid financial performance. Based on our results through the first 9 months of the year, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016. 
We are also on pace to complete approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. Based on these strong results and with confidence in our ability to continue executing on our investment program, we are initiating 2017 net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Additionally, we expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion in planned utility infrastructure investments in 2017. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments outlined in 2014, investments that we expect to drive 4% to 6% long-term annual growth in both net operating earnings and dividend. With this robust level of investment and steady earnings and dividend growth projected, NiSource remains committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and strong liquidity. 
Let's now turn to our third quarter performance. Starting with the business highlights, we continue to make progress on the regulatory front with settlements approved in our base rate cases at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Maryland. Additionally, a settlement was reached in Columbia Gas of Kentucky's rate case, and interim rates were implemented while we continue through the regulatory process in Virginia. At NIPSCO electric, updated base rates went into effect last month following a final order approving our settlement reached in July, and our long-term electric generation strategy is advancing. We'll discuss each of these significant milestones in a few minutes.
On the financial side, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.06 per share versus $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Donald will go into a bit more detail on these results, which can be found on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment and financial information available in the Investors section of niSource.com.

As Joe mentioned, we are on pace to meet our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.10 per share non-GAAP. For the third quarter, on an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $107 million for the quarter, which is a decrease of about $9 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $114 million for the quarter versus about $110 million in the third quarter of 2015. Annually, the biggest driver continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment. I would note that these investments have a somewhat muted impact each year in the third quarter due to inherent lower seasonal sales in our natural gas business.
On a segment level, our Gas Distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $5 million, a decrease of about $17 million from 2015. This variance was driven primarily by nontracked O&M expenses of about $206 million, which is consistent with a quarterly run rate of about $204 million in the last 3 quarters. This quarter-over-quarter variance of $18 million was largely attributable to employee-related benefit true-up and postseparation staffing as well as higher outside service costs driven by gas compliance and maintenance activity. 
The quarter-over-quarter O&M variance was partially offset by new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio’s infrastructure replacement program.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $105 million, an increase of about $3 million from 2015. Similar to the gas segment, Electric Operations nontracked O&M of about $115 million was consistent with the last 3 quarters average of about $115 million. However, it was about $14 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter-over-quarter variance in O&M was primarily attributable to increase generate -- generation-related maintenance activities and employee administration costs related to benefit true-ups. This variance was offset by higher revenue from increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments. 
As you can see, solid progress for the year with continued growth projected for the fourth quarter as we continue to execute our capital program and regulatory initiatives.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $7.7 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $677 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And as a reminder, currently Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at Baa2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

I'll start by highlighting some recognition we recently received. In September, NiSource was named the third straight year to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our sustainable business practices and performance. We're proud of this achievement, a sustainable approach to safety, reliability, customer experience, environmental performance and community engagement is core to our strategy, which delivers values to all of our stakeholders including you, our investors. In order to sustain the company and to continue to execute on our long-term strategy, it's important that we have the right talent in place with the proper skills throughout their career. To support that goal, we are advancing our field training program. The first of 4 new employee training centers featuring modern simulators, hands-on training labs and safety towns opened in Pennsylvania in July. This center is expected to serve on average 35 employees per day and provide training for 100 first responders each year.
In August, we broke ground on a similar center in Ohio, and we'll begin construction of a facility in Virginia later this month. In Massachusetts, we expect to break ground on a center next spring. You can learn more about our approach to training and the features of these centers, which are gaining significant industry attention, via a link on the homepage of nisource.com. 
In addition to enhancing system safety and reliability, our utility investments are focused on growing our customer base. This summer, we launched pilot programs in Pennsylvania and Indiana which are designed to add gas customers through conversions from other fuel sources. The programs include adding field employees who are dedicated to existing customers through the conversion process and interfacing with builders and developers, enhanced marketing, building trade ally networks and streamlining internal processes to accommodate customer conversion.  We plan to expand the program to all NiSource states by 2018. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. In Pennsylvania, on October 27, we received Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the company's continued upgrading and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance cost. It will increase annual revenue by $35 million and also includes incentives to expand gas services to commercial customers. New rates will go into effect in December.
And in Virginia, we implemented updated interim base rates subject to refund on September 28. The new rates are part of a base rate case which remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve overall system safety and reliability and to grow the system in response to increasing customer demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected early next year. 
Our base rate case in Kentucky is progressing, with a settlement agreement reached with parties in later October and is being heard by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. 
If approved as filed, the settlement would increase annual revenue by $13.4 million and allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments to improve overall system safety and reliability. A commission decision is expected by the end of the year. 
And in Maryland, the commission approved the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. And most importantly, it supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. 
In Indiana, at NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. In August, the company filed its semiannual tracker update, covering an additional $67 million of investments made in the first half of 2016. An order by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Other NiSource companies have filed tracker update requests in support of their gas infrastructure modernization program. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement Plan and Columbia Gas of Virginia under its SAVE Act, Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy Plan, program. Combined, these filings cover about $110 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability. As you can see, much progress on the regulatory, customer and infrastructure fronts, with several things to be resolved before the year’s end.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. New rates became effective on October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement. The approved settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO’s continued electric infrastructure investments and service improvements for customers, and it increases the company's annual base rate revenues by about $73 million. NIPSCO is also focused on executing on its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to the electric transmission and distribution system, designed to improve system safety and reliability.
In July, the Indiana Commission approved the settlement related to the program which allows for recovery of approximately $1.25 billion of investments being made through 2022. NIPSCO expects to begin recovering on $46 million of these investments beginning in February 2017.
The company's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are well under way for both projects.
Finally, NIPSCO will submit its integrated resource plan or IRP to the Indiana Commission later today. The IRP process is conducted by Indiana Electricity providers to outline their plans to meet their customers’ anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team has worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes.
The plan remains consistent with the future generation strategy we previewed in August. As outlined in the IRP, NIPSCO today will also file with the IURC for approval to construct required environmental investment at its Michigan City and Schahfer generating facility. 
So before opening the call to questions, I'd like to lift up some key takeaways for the remainder of the year in 2017. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to produce benefits for customers and community while also driving solid financial performance.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016, and we expect 2017 net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Our robust investment plans include approximately $1.5 billion in planned utility infrastructure investments in 2017. NiSource expects to complete about $1.5 billion in such investments in 2016.
These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified long-term regulated utility investments that we outlined in 2014. And we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 4% to 6% annually while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Finally, while we'll provide more specific details later, I wanted to highlight that we are planning to host an Investor Day sometime in the later part of the first quarter of 2017. This New York event will provide an opportunity for the NiSource team to share a more comprehensive picture of our utility investment strategy. So stay tuned. More to come as we confirm the date and details of that event. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

And so while we continue to look at the opportunities to refinance early, I think over time, we'll also just naturally bring the cost of debt down lower."

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides. The NiSource team has continued to execute programs and regulatory initiatives that benefit our customers by enhancing system safety, reliability and customer services, while driving solid financial performance. Based on our results through the first 9 months of the year, we continue to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016. 
We are also on pace to complete approximately $1.5 billion in capital investments. Based on these strong results and with confidence in our ability to continue executing on our investment program, we are initiating 2017 net operating earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Additionally, we expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion in planned utility infrastructure investments in 2017. These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for continuing sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified regulated utility investments outlined in 2014, investments that we expect to drive 4% to 6% long-term annual growth in both net operating earnings and dividend. With this robust level of investment and steady earnings and dividend growth projected, NiSource remains committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and strong liquidity. 
Let's now turn to our third quarter performance. Starting with the business highlights, we continue to make progress on the regulatory front with settlements approved in our base rate cases at Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania and Columbia Gas of Maryland. Additionally, a settlement was reached in Columbia Gas of Kentucky's rate case, and interim rates were implemented while we continue through the regulatory process in Virginia. At NIPSCO electric, updated base rates went into effect last month following a final order approving our settlement reached in July, and our long-term electric generation strategy is advancing. We'll discuss each of these significant milestones in a few minutes.
On the financial side, we delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.06 per share versus $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Donald will go into a bit more detail on these results, which can be found on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment and financial information available in the Investors section of niSource.com.

As Joe mentioned, we are on pace to meet our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.10 per share non-GAAP. For the third quarter, on an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $107 million for the quarter, which is a decrease of about $9 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our operating income was about $114 million for the quarter versus about $110 million in the third quarter of 2015. Annually, the biggest driver continues to be the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment. I would note that these investments have a somewhat muted impact each year in the third quarter due to inherent lower seasonal sales in our natural gas business.
On a segment level, our Gas Distribution operation segment delivered operating earnings of about $5 million, a decrease of about $17 million from 2015. This variance was driven primarily by nontracked O&M expenses of about $206 million, which is consistent with a quarterly run rate of about $204 million in the last 3 quarters. This quarter-over-quarter variance of $18 million was largely attributable to employee-related benefit true-up and postseparation staffing as well as higher outside service costs driven by gas compliance and maintenance activity. 
The quarter-over-quarter O&M variance was partially offset by new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio’s infrastructure replacement program.
Our Electric Operations segment reported operating earnings of about $105 million, an increase of about $3 million from 2015. Similar to the gas segment, Electric Operations nontracked O&M of about $115 million was consistent with the last 3 quarters average of about $115 million. However, it was about $14 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter-over-quarter variance in O&M was primarily attributable to increase generate -- generation-related maintenance activities and employee administration costs related to benefit true-ups. This variance was offset by higher revenue from increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments. 
As you can see, solid progress for the year with continued growth projected for the fourth quarter as we continue to execute our capital program and regulatory initiatives.
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of September 30 was about $7.7 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $677 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities. And as a reminder, currently Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody's at Baa2 and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss a few customer, infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights."

This center is expected to serve on average 35 employees per day and provide training for 100 first responders each year.
In August, we broke ground on a similar center in Ohio, and we'll begin construction of a facility in Virginia later this month. In Massachusetts, we expect to break ground on a center next spring. You can learn more about our approach to training and the features of these centers, which are gaining significant industry attention, via a link on the homepage of nisource.com. 
In addition to enhancing system safety and reliability, our utility investments are focused on growing our customer base. This summer, we launched pilot programs in Pennsylvania and Indiana which are designed to add gas customers through conversions from other fuel sources. The programs include adding field employees who are dedicated to existing customers through the conversion process and interfacing with builders and developers, enhanced marketing, building trade ally networks and streamlining internal processes to accommodate customer conversion.  We plan to expand the program to all NiSource states by 2018. 
Now let's turn to some specific highlights for the quarter from our gas operations on Slide 6. In Pennsylvania, on October 27, we received Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval of a settlement agreement in our base rate case. The approved settlement supports the company's continued upgrading and replacement of infrastructure and allows recovery of increases in safety-related operating and maintenance cost. It will increase annual revenue by $35 million and also includes incentives to expand gas services to commercial customers. New rates will go into effect in December.
And in Virginia, we implemented updated interim base rates subject to refund on September 28. The new rates are part of a base rate case which remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other costs associated with the company's ongoing initiatives to improve overall system safety and reliability and to grow the system in response to increasing customer demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million. A commission decision is expected early next year. 
Our base rate case in Kentucky is progressing, with a settlement agreement reached with parties in later October and is being heard by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. 
If approved as filed, the settlement would increase annual revenue by $13.4 million and allow for continued system modernization and pipeline safety investments to improve overall system safety and reliability. A commission decision is expected by the end of the year. 
And in Maryland, the commission approved the settlement agreement in our base rate case. The settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. And most importantly, it supports the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. 
In Indiana, at NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. In August, the company filed its semiannual tracker update, covering an additional $67 million of investments made in the first half of 2016. An order by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Other NiSource companies have filed tracker update requests in support of their gas infrastructure modernization program. This includes Columbia Gas of Massachusetts under its Gas System Enhancement Plan and Columbia Gas of Virginia under its SAVE Act, Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy Plan, program. Combined, these filings cover about $110 million in capital investments focused on safety and reliability. As you can see, much progress on the regulatory, customer and infrastructure fronts, with several things to be resolved before the year’s end.
Now let's turn to our Electric Operations on Slide 7. New rates became effective on October 1 under NIPSCO's electric base rate case settlement. The approved settlement provides a platform for NIPSCO’s continued electric infrastructure investments and service improvements for customers, and it increases the company's annual base rate revenues by about $73 million. NIPSCO is also focused on executing on its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to the electric transmission and distribution system, designed to improve system safety and reliability.
In July, the Indiana Commission approved the settlement related to the program which allows for recovery of approximately $1.25 billion of investments being made through 2022. NIPSCO expects to begin recovering on $46 million of these investments beginning in February 2017.
The company's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Substation, line and tower construction are well under way for both projects.
Finally, NIPSCO will submit its integrated resource plan or IRP to the Indiana Commission later today. The IRP process is conducted by Indiana Electricity providers to outline their plans to meet their customers’ anticipated long-term energy needs. The NIPSCO team has worked constructively with stakeholders to develop a balanced plan focused on providing customers affordable clean energy while maintaining flexibility for future technology and market changes.
The plan remains consistent with the future generation strategy we previewed in August. As outlined in the IRP, NIPSCO today will also file with the IURC for approval to construct required environmental investment at its Michigan City and Schahfer generating facility. 
So before opening the call to questions, I'd like to lift up some key takeaways for the remainder of the year in 2017. NiSource's long-term utility infrastructure modernization programs continue to produce benefits for customers and community while also driving solid financial performance.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for 2016, and we expect 2017 net operating earnings of $1.12 to $1.18 per share. Our robust investment plans include approximately $1.5 billion in planned utility infrastructure investments in 2017. NiSource expects to complete about $1.5 billion in such investments in 2016.
These investment levels keep NiSource on pace for sustained execution on the more than $30 billion of identified long-term regulated utility investments that we outlined in 2014. And we continue to expect to grow both operating earnings and our dividend by 4% to 6% annually while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. 
Finally, while we'll provide more specific details later, I wanted to highlight that we are planning to host an Investor Day sometime in the later part of the first quarter of 2017. This New York event will provide an opportunity for the NiSource team to share a more comprehensive picture of our utility investment strategy. So stay tuned. More to come as we confirm the date and details of that event. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource.

And so while we continue to look at the opportunities to refinance early, I think over time, we'll also just naturally bring the cost of debt down lower."

Let's start on Page 3 of our supplemental slides. With 12 months of execution behind us since the separation of our interstate pipeline business, NiSource is well-positioned as a premier pure-play regulated utility with a solid long-term business plan based on large-scale infrastructure modernization programs. Since well before the separation, we've been building momentum executing our electric and gas investment and regulatory programs while enhancing our focus on customer service across our 7 states. I'm more confident than ever that we've got the right plan and the right team in place to deliver on the commitments we've outlined for customers and shareholders.
Reflecting that confidence on the strength of our first 6 months of performance in 2016 and recent execution highlights, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings for 2016 of $1.05 to $1.10 per share, a narrowing of our $1 to $1.10 per share guidance that we originally announced about 15 months ago. 
And now to our results for the second quarter. The NiSource team delivered non-GAAP net operating earnings of $0.08 per share. With strong execution of our construction program and in partaking advantage of favorable weather, we now expect to make nearly $1.5 billion of utility infrastructure investments in 2016. These well-established programs across our footprint are improving safety, reliability, service and environmental performance for our customers and communities.
Highlighting our continued regulatory progress, in July, we received commission approval on both the NIPSCO electric base rate case and long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. And our regulatory activity at our Columbia companies remains on schedule with rate cases in Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania on track for expected commission orders by the end of the year, with Virginia to follow closely behind in early 2017.
Notably, we reached a settlement in Maryland just last week. We'll talk more about each of these in a few minutes. 
Supplementing the value delivered to our ongoing infrastructure strategy is a strong, sustainable and growing dividend, which we continue to project will increase by 4% to 6% each year. And on May 11, we delivered on that commitment by increasing our annualized dividend by 6.5%. Our credit ratings are stable and improving, and our liquidity position remains solid at $619 million. And just last month, Fitch upgraded its rating of NiSource from BBB- to BBB, and we maintained our investment-grade rating of BBB+ and Baa2 with stable outlooks at Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively.
As you can see, strong performance continued in the second quarter, with additional progress already in place for the third quarter. Let's turn the call to Donald to review our financial results in more detail. You can find those on Page 4 of our supplemental slides and in our segment in financial information available in the investors section of nisource.com. Donald?"

As Joe mentioned, we delivered second quarter non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $26 million or $0.08 per share compared with about $1 million or $0.00 per share in 2015.
On an operating earnings basis, NiSource reported about $134 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $32 million over the same period in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was about $29 million for the quarter versus a loss of about $73 million in the second quarter of 2015. The biggest drivers of our performance continue to be the impact of our long-term regulatory program and infrastructure investments.
Our gas distribution operations delivered operating earnings of about $73 million, an increase of more than $17 million, primarily attributable to new base rates at Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania as well as new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure related -- replacement program. Our electric operations reported operating earnings of about $64 million, an increase of more than $7 million, primarily attributable to increased capital spend on electric transmission projects and environmental investments.
While Joe mentioned it earlier, I wanted to reiterate that we now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share for the year. 
Now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. Our debt level as of June 30 was about $7.3 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 14 years, and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.7%, down from 5.88% at the end of 2015.
At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $619 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facilities.

The report highlights how we're delivering on our commitments to safety, customer satisfaction, system enhancements and being recognized among the best places to work. The report provides stakeholders with a glimpse into our continued sustainability efforts, a key component of our business plan. This report is available at nisource.com. And a significant enhancement for our customers was introduced in May, a redesigned bill across our 7 states. The new bill format features user-friendly updates to make it easier to read and understand. Consistent with our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders, customer feedback was a key input into the design of the new bill. 
So let's turn to some highlights from our gas operations on Slide 6. At NIPSCO gas, the team continues to execute on its 7-year, approximately $800 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety.
Supporting this investment, on June 22, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, or IURC, approved the company's semiannual tracker update. This update covered an incremental $72 million of investments through the end of 2015 and will increase annual revenues by $6.7 million.
On May 27, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to adjust its base rates to recover investments and other cost associated with ongoing initiatives to improve system safety and reliability.
If approved as filed, this case would increase annual revenues by about $25 million. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania's base rate case is progressing on schedule with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The case seeks to adjust base rates in support of our continued upgrades and replacement of infrastructure and to recover increases in safety-related operating and maintenance costs. The case also includes enhanced provisions for customer growth. If approved as filed, the case would result in a $55 million annual revenue increase. I would note that productive settlement discussions are taking place in this case.
Also in Pennsylvania, we opened our first of 4 centralized employee training centers. The $10 million, 22,000 square foot facility includes simulators, a safety town and other hands-on training designed to help develop our next-generation of talent. This is an exciting investment that supports long-term sustainability by helping us attract and retain some of the best talent in the industry. Other facilities are in the planning stages in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts.
Columbia Gas of Virginia's base rate case remains pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The request seeks to adjust base rates to recover investments and other cost associated with ongoing initiatives to improve the overall safety and reliability, and to enable increasing demand for service. If approved as filed, the case would result in an annual revenue increase of $37 million.
At Columbia Gas of Maryland, the company, on July 27, filed a joint settlement agreement in its base rate case with the staff of the Maryland Public Service Commission and the Maryland office of People's Counsel. The proposed settlement includes an annual revenue increase of $3.7 million and provisions to encourage customer growth. The case, filed in April, seeks to adjust base rates to support the continued replacement of aging infrastructure and the adoption of increased pipeline safety upgrades. New rates are expected to be in effect in November 2016. We expect commission decisions in Pennsylvania and Kentucky by the end of the year, and again, in Virginia in early 2017. As you can see, our teams are successfully executing all phases of our plan, and you'll see similar things at our electric business. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7. As I mentioned at the start of the call, the NIPSCO team reached significant milestones with commission approval of settlements in both its electric base rate case and its long-term electric infrastructure modernization program. On July 18, the IURC approved an agreement that NIPSCO reached with key stakeholders in its electric base rate case. The approved settlement agreement provides a platform for continued investments in service improvements. New rates go into effect on October 1, and will increase annual revenues by $72.5 million.
And on July 12, the IURC approved a NIPSCO 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program settlement. With more than $1.2 billion of planned investments, the IURC's decision provides a clear path to continue making the necessary upgrades to our electric infrastructure in northern Indiana, now and into the future.
And last but not least, NIPSCO's 2 major electric transmission projects remain on schedule with anticipated in-service dates in the second half of 2018. Both projects are designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and engineering are well underway for both projects with line construction in its early stages.
And before opening the call to questions, I'd like to touch on our ongoing commitment. NiSource remains on track for sustained execution on our $30 billion of long-term regulated utility investments the company outlined in 2014.
These system modernization plans continue to deliver value for all stakeholders across our 7 states.
Our capital investment plan for 2016 has been updated from approximately $1.4 billion to nearly $1.5 billion driven by our team's high performance execution and supported by favorable weather conditions for construction so far this year.
As we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, we've focused our earnings guidance for the year and now expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10.
While we are not yet providing guidance or investment plans for 2017, this 2016 earnings guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4% to 6%.
I'm particularly proud of our employees. Through their talent and dedication to serving our customers, we're delivering on our commitments, which are focused on industry-leading safety performance and top-tier customer service. Our balanced and constructive strategy is designed to sustain performance and continue delivering on these commitments well into the future. Thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of NiSource. We look forward to sharing continued updates on our progress. Now let's open the call to your questions. Michelle?"

So if anything, just confidence in the support that we have for the investments we've long planned."

As you noted, we are at the very, very early stages of implementation of some of our enhanced growth strategies, recently having begun to implement some of our pilot programs in Indiana and Pennsylvania. That represent enhanced focus on growth opportunities and outreach. So not yet seeing any measurable impact of those enhanced strategies. Probably, more notably, as I said in a number of the rate case updates, our regulatory strategy has been focused in part on enhancing the ability to attract new customers with programs that support the upfront -- relief on the upfront cost for new customers or conversion customers. We've seen support for that across most of the jurisdictions of -- year-to-date, as we stand here, we are -- on a gross basis, so we often talk of attrition on the customer count as well. But on a gross basis, we're running about 10% ahead of where we were at this time last year, driven predominantly by -- and this varies across our territory but by strong housing starts in certain parts of the territory, notably in Virginia. We've seen strong surges in construction and opportunities for growth there. And in conversion -- fuel conversion, again in Massachusetts, where that's been strong. Year-on-year about 10% growth keeping in mind we have attrition that offsets that. We're just beginning to see a slight uptick in our growth rates. So too early to tell if that's going to carry on through the balance of the year, but I'm optimistic."
