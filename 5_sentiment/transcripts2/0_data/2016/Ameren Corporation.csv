Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share, which represents an approximate 7% increase over 2014 results. In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance",2700,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share, which represents an approximate 7% increase over 2014 results. 
In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 and $2.60, which includes an expected temporary negative impact, reduced sales to Noranda Aluminum. And we are pleased to announce updated rate base growth plans of approximately 6.5%, compounded annually from 2015 through 2020, which is expected to drive earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 through 2020, excluding the impact of Noranda on 2016 earnings. 
We will discuss these earnings expectations further in a moment. Moving back to 2015 results, the strong 2015 earnings growth, compared to 2014, reflected increased FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery earnings, resulting from infrastructure investments leading to constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center and disciplined cost management. These positive variances were partially offset by lower retail electric and natural gas sales volumes, driven by very mild fourth quarter 2015 winter temperatures. 
The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower allowed returns on equity and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Marty will discuss these and other 2015 earnings drivers in a few minutes. 
Turning to page 5, I'd like to share my perspectives on our 2015 performance. Overall, I believe we delivered strong results for our shareholders and customers in 2015, despite facing several challenges. These results were driven by successfully executing our strategic plan. Starting with our focus on prudently investing in and operating our rate-regulated utilities, we continue to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks in order to enhance great reliability and allow our customers to better manage their energy usage. 
In fact, we invested $1.9 billion in utility infrastructure last year, with almost 70% or $1.3 billion that is going to projects in our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses. A significant portion of these investments was made in the Illinois Rivers project, where construction is proceeding according to plan with FERC on the 9 segments and 10 substations well underway and some portions already complete. The strategic allocation of capital and effective execution of this project, coupled with disciplined cost management, contributed to a higher consolidated earned return on equity. And this was accomplished while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving down to page, we also achieved constructive December rate orders in both our Illinois electric delivery update and natural gas delivery rate cases. Further, we should not forget that earlier in 2015, we were successful in our advocacy efforts to extend Illinois modernized electric regulatory framework through the end of 2019. That extension have strong bipartisan support because Illinois' regulatory framework is encouraging greater investment and infrastructure, which in turn, is delivering better reliability, a more efficient, modernized grid and significant job creation at reasonable cost to customers. 
Since 2011, even with the substantial infrastructure investments we have made, Illinois residential electric delivery prices have increased at a compound annual rate, which is less than 2.5%. Simply put, the Illinois framework is win-win for customers, the state of Illinois and shareholders. 
Overall, efforts within each regulatory jurisdictions to create and capitalize on investments for the benefit of customers and shareholders are showing positive results. 
In 2015, we improved distribution system reliability and continued our solid base load energy center performance. And our strong operating performance, combined with the fact that our rates remain well below regional and national averages, contributed to improve customer satisfaction. 
The bottom line is that we are working everyday to provide safer and more reliable service our customers, and we achieved this in 2015 despite challenging newer weather conditions, including unprecedented flooding and an ice storm. 
While I'm pleased with the results we delivered in 2015, I'm particularly pretty pleased with our team successful execution of our strategy over the last 3 calendar years delivered a pure lead in total shareholder return of approximately 60%. As a result, and looking ahead, we're going to stay the course and remain focused on executing this strategy. 
Turning now to page 6 and our 2016 earnings outlook. We anticipate 2016 earnings to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The primary drivers of the variance between 2015 actual results and 2016 guidance range are noted on this page and Marty will cover these in more detail a bit later. 
I want to highlight that our 2016 guidance includes an estimated $0.13 per share reduction in net earnings anticipated to result from significantly lower electric sales in Noranda. I want to spend a few moments on this unique and temporary headwind that we face. 
Moving to page 7, here, we summarize key facts about Noranda's current situation and why we fully expects its impact on Ameren Missouri to be temporary. First, you should know that Noranda operates an aluminum smelter in Southeast Missouri, and we are our largest customer. On January 8, 2016, Noranda announced a production have been idle at 2 of the 3 pot lines at a smelter operation, following and electric supply circuit failure. The circuit failure did not occur on assets owned by Ameren Missouri. 
Further, on February 8, 2016, Noranda and its subseries filed voluntary petitions for restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court due to operating issues as well as very challenging global aluminum market conditions. At that time, Noranda stated that it expected to curtail all remaining operations at its smelter this March. Although it would remain the flexibility to restart operations should conditions allow. 
While we are working closely with Noranda and other key stakeholders on legislation to provide Noranda with long-term, globally competitive electric rates, we can't predict at this time whether it will restart its smelter operations. As a result, our 2016 earnings guidance assumes Noranda will not start any of its pot lines this year. We can and will take actions to mitigate the financial impacts of Noranda's outage on Ameren Missouri. 
Those actions may include seeking recovery of lost revenues in the context of electric rate case of filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission for an accounting authority order. At a minimum, at Ameren Missouri's next electric rate case, we expect the Missouri commission would accurately reflect Noranda's ongoing sales volumes, thereby removing the related drag on our prospective earnings. 
Pending conclusion of the Missouri legislative process, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case this year in order to earn a fair return on investments made to serve customers. As a result, we fully expect the earnings impact from Noranda's slower sales to the temporary. 
Turning to page 8, here are key areas of focus for 2016 as we continue to execute our strategy. Our FERC-regulated transmission businesses will advance to regional multivalue and local liability projects included in our capital investment plan. In addition, we will continue to work to obtain objective outcomes in the complaint cases pending [ph] that the FERC would seek to reduce the base allowed ROE from [indiscernible] transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
In late December, the FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order in the initial complaint case recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE. We expect to file a FERC order in that case in the fourth quarter this year. 
Moving to Illinois electric and gas delivery, Ameren Illinois will continue to invest in infrastructure improvements to upgrade systems to enhance reliability and safety, including those under its Modernization Action Plan. This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019, including approximately 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters this year. 
Turning now to Missouri, where modernizing their regulatory framework remains a high priority. We've been actively engaged in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders, including other Missouri investor-owned utilities to build support for legislation that would modernize Missouri's existing regulatory framework. An improved framework will allow us to increase investments to replace and upgrade aging Missouri energy infrastructure to enhance reliability and customer service and to retain and create jobs. 
Earlier this month, Senate Bill 1028 and identical House Bill 24 95 were filed with the intention of accomplishing these objectives. I will touch more on this legislation in a moment. 
Finally, in another regulatory matter, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a new Ameren Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan will begin March 1 this year and continue through February  2019 and follows on the heels of our very successful 3-year energy efficiency plan completed at the end of last year. 
We believe the new plan, which reflected an agreement between Ameren Missouri and other key stakeholders, appropriately balances customer and shareholder interest. We accomplished this by providing for timely recovery of both energy efficiency program costs and revenue losses resulting from these programs.
In addition, the plan provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn performances and revenues, which would be $27 million if 100% of the energy efficiency goals are achieved during the 3-year period. Within these revenues recognized after the plan include. 
Regarding Ameren wide initiatives for 2016, as you know, the U.S. Supreme Court recently stayed the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The state blocks the plan's implementation until this legality is determined by the courts. A 3 judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit is scheduled to your legal challenges to the Clean Power Plan beginning on June 2 of this year. 
We agree with the Supreme Court's decision. It is in the best interest of our customers and the communities we serve because we believe it's important to know whether this world would extend legal challenges before steps are taken to implement. Of course, we can't predict the outcome of these legal challenges. We remain committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. As a result, we will continue to advocate the responsible energy policies related to the EPA's Clean Power Plan while working with key stakeholders to address important issues associated with the Missouri and Illinois state implementation plans should the Clean Power Plan ultimately be upheld. 
Finally, we will continue our ongoing opportunities to relentlessly improve operating performance, including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation with the goal of earning at or close to our allowed ROEs. 
Turning to page 9, I would now like to discus the recently introduced Missouri legislation. Senate Bill 1028 and identical House Bill 2495 would modernize Missouri's regulatory framework to support and encourage investment in aging energy infrastructure for all Missouri investor-owned electric utilities for the benefit of their customers. The proposed legislation calls for time recovery of actual, previously incurred costs of providing service to customer. But would also provide long-term, globally competitive electric rates for energy intensive customers like Noranda. Rather, this legislation would include several customer benefits, including earnings gaps and rates stabilization mechanism as well as provide incentive fees for utilities to achieve certain performance standards. Ultimately, passing of this legislation would be an important step forward to the state of Missouri. This legislation would spur investment in aging infrastructure, support incremental investments in physical and cybersecurity, support environmental upgrades and cleaner generation sources as well as position Missouri's grid for growth in the future at a time when interest rates remain very low. All this will be done by providing more stable and predictable raises for customers and other appropriate safeguards under the strong oversight with the Missouri Public Service Commission. Importantly, this legislation will create and retain jobs throughout the state of Missouri. It is a win-win for all stakeholders. 
In upcoming weeks, we expect that additional language which will be added to the bills as consensus building is advanced and the bills move through the legislative process. As a result, it will be premature to go through the specific details of the legislation at this time. We are pleased that both Senate and House leadership are supporting this legislation, including key leaders of the Senate commerce committee and the House utilities committee. 
Of course, and as you know, the legislative process is complex and lengthy. We continue to work with key stakeholders to advance this legislation in a thoughtful, yet timely fashion. The regulation sessions ends on May 13, 2016. 
Moving on to page 10, our long-term total return outlook. In February of last year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a 6% compound annual rate for the 2014 through 2019 period. Today, we are rolling forward our multi-year plan, and I am very pleased to see that we expect to grow rate base in an even higher approximately 6.5% compound annual rate over the new 2015 through 2020 period. I want to be clear that our new rate base growth outlook incorporates the effects of the recent 5-year extension of bonus tax depreciation. You will recall that late last year, we noted that we were evaluating bringing forward into our new 5-year investment plan certain reliability projects, which totaled between $500 million and $1 billion. 
Our team ultimately brought forward in excess of $1.5 billion of additional Ameren Illinois energy delivery and transmission reliability projects that have now been incorporated into our updated 5-year plan. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, we are allocating significant and growing amounts of capital to our FERC-regulated transmission businesses and Illinois delivery utilities, in line with our strategy. Projects projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by approximately 20% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2020 period. 
In addition, our Ameren Illinois investments are expected to result in projected natural gas and electric delivery compound annual rate base growth of 11% and 6%, respectively, over this period. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. This level of Missouri growth incorporates increased mandatory environmental expenditures associated with coal combustion residuals. 
Our updated 5-year capital expenditure plan illustrates Ameren's strong pipeline of investment opportunities to address aging infrastructure and reliability needs that we have discussed with you previously. 
In projects that we have brought forward enable us to take advantage of the cash flow stimulus benefits, the bonus tax depreciation with the benefit of customers, to more than offset the effects of both depreciation and projected rate base. Utility infrastructure investments and projected rate base growth that I just discussed do not only bring superior value to our customers, but also to our shareholders. We expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate for 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net negative effect on 2016 earnings of $0.13 per share as a result of lower sales in Noranda. And we expect this growth will compare well with our regulated utility peers. 
Further, we continue to expect compound annual earnings rate growth for the 2013 through 2018 period within the range of 7% to 10%. 
Looking ahead, we will also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. The Board of Directors decision to increase the dividend by 3.7% last October for the second consecutive year reflected its confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings and rate base growth plan. 
We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based in consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board and I'm convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us on today's call. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to page 12 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share compared to earnings of $2.40 per share for the prior year. We were pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that were just above th",2324,"Good morning, everybody. Turning now to page 12 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share compared to earnings of $2.40 per share for the prior year. We were pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that were just above the midpoint of our initial 2015 guidance we provided early last year despite some significant headwinds in the fourth quarter, including extremely mild temperatures and the extension of bonus tax depreciation. As you can see, there were no difference between GAAP and core results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Moving then to page 13, here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.16 per share increase in 2015 results. Key factors included increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our Illinois and ATXI businesses, which increased earnings by $0.20 per share compared to 2014. 
In addition, the earnings comparison benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling maintenance outage of the Callaway Energy Center, which cost $0.09 in 2014. These fuel outages are scheduled to occur every 18 months. Further, earlier last year, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved recovery of certain Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage cost and this had a positive effect on the earnings comparison. Earnings also benefited from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower-cost debt. 
Finally, as Warner mentioned, we continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including managing costs in a disciplined manner. 
Reflecting this, 2015 other operations and maintenance expenses declined compared to the prior year for our Missouri utility. Factors having an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons included lower retail electric and natural gas sales, driven by mild weather. Weather effects decreased full year 2015 earnings by an estimated $0.06 per share compared to 2014. 
The unfavorable earnings impact of very mild fourth quarter 2015 temperatures is estimated to have been $0.08 versus normal, which more than offset an estimated $0.05 per share favorable impact of weather experienced over the first 9 months of 2015. Heating degree days were down about 30% versus normal fourth quarter levels. We estimate that weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers were flat year-over-year, while such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased about 1%. 
The decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan compensated for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from energy efficiency programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by about one quarter of 1%. 
For 2015, kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois and Missouri's industrial customers decreased approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, primarily reflecting lower sales to large, low-margin Illinois customers in agriculture and steelmaking as well as lower sales in Missouri to Noranda. 
Moving back to the discussion of 2015 results, the year-over-year earnings comparison was unfavorably affected by lower capitalized Ameren Missouri financing cost of $0.06 per share, due to a larger balance of infrastructure projects in process and ultimately, placed in service during 2015. 
The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower recognized allowed ROEs, which reduced the contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois by a total of $0.05 per share. 
Since 2014, our transmission earnings have been reduced by our reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. In addition, 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporated an 8.64% allowed ROE compared to 9.14% in 2014. This decline was due to a decrease in the annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.34% to 2.84%. The 2015 earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by increased depreciation and amortization expenses of $0.05 per share and finally, by the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost. 
Turning to page 14 of our presentation, next, I would like to discuss details of our 2016 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.60, including an estimated $0.13 reduction related to significantly lower expected sales volumes to Noranda compared to 2015. This estimated earnings impact is net of expected revenues from off-system sales that Ameren Missouri makes as a result of reduced sales to Noranda. Revenues from these off-system sales are allowed to be retained under a provision in the fuel adjustment clause. 
This estimate incorporates such off-system sales in and around the clock indie hub power price, net of estimated basis differential, reflecting the location of our energy centers. Further, we assume that the 2 of Noranda's 3 smelter pot lines that were out -- idled in early January remain out of service. That the third pot line is idled in March as Noranda has indicated that all 3 of these production lines remain idled for the balance of the year. 
Finally, as of February 8 of this year, the date Noranda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Noranda had prepaid an amount to Ameren Missouri that exceeded its utility service usage. Ameren Missouri expects to be paid in full for utility services provided after February 8, 2016. 
With this overview, I will now walk through key 2016 earnings drivers and assumptions for each of our businesses.
Like 2015 results, expected 2016 earnings reflect increases in FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base, which are noted on this page. Our projected 2016 electric transmission earnings continued to include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO days-allowed ROE but also incorporate the 50-basis-point adder FERC has authorized because of our MISO membership. Further, expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula-based ROE of 9% using a forecast of 3.2% for the 2016 average 30-year treasury bond yield. 
For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, earnings will reflect new rates that incorporate the higher rate base levels and increase cost included in the 2016 future test year utilized to determine those rates as well as the higher return on equity authorized in the December rate order. 
Shifting to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery earnings will reflect the absence in 2015 of $0.04 per share related to the ICC order approving the recovery of power usage cost that I mentioned earlier. 
Before we move on, I do want to highlight that we recognize that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formula ratemaking and pending MISO complaint case. 
Therefore, on this page, we have provided estimates of 2016 earnings per share sensitivities associated with hypothetical changes and allowed ROEs. Turning now to page 15 and 2016 key drivers and assumptions related to Ameren Missouri earnings. The year-over-year earnings comparison is expected to be unfavorably affected by the already discussed estimated net earnings decline related to lower sales to Noranda. Further, as we noted on our earnings call in November, we expect Ameren Missouri's highly successful 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency program to reduce sales levels in 2016, negatively impacting earnings compared to last year. 
A portion of this impact will be offset by a performance incentive, subject to commission approval. I want to note that Ameren Missouri's new plant, which Warner mentioned, and which becomes effective March 1, will not mitigate the unfavorable effects on 2016 earnings, resulting from the prior energy efficiency plan. There are certain key differences between the Missouri energy efficiency program that ended in 2015 and the new program that begins next month. 
The 2013 through 2015 program compensated Ameren Missouri in each of those years for the immediate and longer-term financial impacts of energy efficiency programs initiated in each of those years, which is leading to 2016 financial headwinds. 
The 2016 through 2019 program is again designed to fully compensate Ameren Missouri for the financial impacts of the energy efficiency programs. However, excluding the potential for performance incentive payments in 2019, in any given year, the impacts are expected to be earnings neutral. The earnings comparison is also expected to be unfavorably affected by Ameren Missouri regulatory lag reflecting depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses that are higher than the levels collected in rates. 
Finally, a Callaway nuclear refueling maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016 is expected to reduce earnings by $0.09 per share. 
Shifting now to factors that are expected to favorably affect Ameren Missouri's earnings comparison. We estimate that other operations and maintenance expenses, not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, will decline. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management efforts. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions, but this goal continues to be challenging to -- challenging [indiscernible] assuming normalized, annual level of Calloway refueling outage expenses that exclude the net earnings impact of reduced sales to Noranda, we expect Ameren Missouri to earn 10, 50 [ph] basis points of its 9.53% allowed ROE. 
Before I leave the discussion of 2016 expectations for our Illinois a Missouri utilities, I would like to discuss our sales outlook. As noted on pages 14 and 15, a return to normal temperatures in 2016 would benefit Ameren's earnings by a combined estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2015. We expect combined Illinois and Missouri weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year, partially affecting the previously mentioned effects of our Missouri energy efficiency programs that ended in 2015, the new 2016 energy efficiency programs as well as energy efficiency programs in Illinois. 
Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be flat to up slightly compared to last year, excluding the anticipated decline in sales to Noranda. 
Moving now to parent and other cost. During the fourth quarter of last year, we issued long-term debt at the Ameren parent company to repay short-term borrowings. While this new long-term debt was issued at a low cost, it will have an unfavorable effect on the 2016 earnings comparison. Further, on an Ameren consolidated basis, we forecast our 2016 effective income tax rate will be about 38%, comparable to the 2015 core effective tax rate. And finally, this earnings guidance reflects no change in average basic common shares outstanding from the prior year level. 
Moving then to page 16. For 2016, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $790 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of approximately $2.2 billion of planned 2016 capital expenditures, with about 2/3 in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of cash on hand in short and long-term borrowings. 
Turning to Page 17 of the presentation, here, we provide an overview of our $11.1 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2016 through 2020 period. First, let me provide further details on the type of projects included in our strong 5-year growth plan and in particular, focus to those jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. 
The increased Illinois electric delivery investments will address aging infrastructure and support system capacity additions and reliability improvements. These include substation breaker and transformer replacements, underground residential distribution replacements, line rebuilds, and reconductor projects as well as capacity additions and line hardening. 
Planned investment increases in Illinois natural gas delivery targets safety and reliability improvements and consistent gas transmission coupled steel system and gas storage field compressor replacements as well as regulator station rebuilds and upgrades and other system rebuilds where conditions warrant. And the added Ameren Illinois local transmission investments will enhance reliability and includes age and condition-based replacement of structures, shield wire, conductors, transformers, breakers, switches and other equipment. 
Of course, in Missouri, we will continue to make prudent investments to provide safe and adequate service. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of income tax deferrals and tax assets over the 5 years ending in 2020. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures in the recent 5-year extension of bonus tax depreciating, which added about $930 million to this expectation. The tax assets totaled approximately $630 million at year-end 2015, with approximately $430 million of these at the parent company, which are not currently earning a return. And we expect these tax assets to be realized into 2021. 
Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity through this planning period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Now turning to page 18, I will summarize. We delivered strong 7% core earnings per share growth in 2015, and we are successfully executing our strategy. We also expect earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate for 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. This earnings growth is driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period, based on a mix that needed transmission, distribution, generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions for the benefit of our customers. 
When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.7%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors.

Obviously, the key there, the big driver is rate-based growth. And as we announced today, we got 6.5% compound annual rate-based growth planned for the period of 2015 to 2020, which obviously is smack in the middle of that earnings per share growth range as well. And that rate base growth is the foundation. And we'd say that --  I'd say that, that growth rate of 5% to 8% incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions. As you know, that over time, in our planning, we look at consensus estimates for growth in the 30-year treasury rate, which today, I think, economists are expecting it to rise about 200 basis points between now and 2020. But when we look at that growth rate range, it accommodates a number of alternatives, both that increase in Treasury rates over time as well as even a low interest rate environment like the one we're in persisting over this period of time. So it incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions, ROEs, regulatory decisions, changes in economic conditions, et cetera. In terms of sales growth, our -- embedded in our forecast over this time, it's about flattish sales growth through this period. But for the energy efficiency programs, we would expect to see modest growth but as a result of the programs that we got in place, we do expect it to be pretty flattish over this period of time.

And that ultimately, it's a temporary impact because as we file a rate case, and we incorporate the reduction in sales to Noranda, the net impact will go away in terms of the overall revenue requirements and how our revenues will be formulated in the context for a rate case. What an accounting authority order would potentially allow you to do, you would be able to defer the impact of the loss revenues between now and when rates are reset for potential recovery of those costs. And we could either do that as an accounting authority order or also, as we pointed out in the call, you could make that request as part of a rate case. So there's a couple of alternatives there. I think one key is that it's not -- there's really no time loaded on that meeting. If you were to file an AAO, it wouldn't just be for perspective impacts. You could also request and as part of that to recover the lost revenues from the date the incident first happened forward in time. So there's not really a clock ticking on that. So we'll  consider those options. As I said before, certainly, very unfortunate what's happened with Noranda here in January with the outrage. They still have one pot line running.

Got it. And one other thing. When you're thinking about the potential -- and Warner already mentioned there are lots of opportunities for investment. When you think about the potential, is it kind of on the margin or incremental? Or is it significant and structural? I mean, when I say significant and structural, I think what you've done in Illinois since the 2011 [indiscernible] past has been a structural change in the investment opportunity in a single state, given the change in regulation. Do you view Missouri as being a potential another Illinois, or just having an opportunity for a marginal uptake in investment?"

So over this period of time, we're looking to spend, in any given year, I'd say anywhere between that 2.155 up to about 235 O [ph] by 2 billion 3 50 over this period of time, so -- and obviously, again, trying to achieve as best as we can, steady rate base growth through time.

Their rate is lower during the period of October through May at around $31 per megawatt hour. And then from June to September, it's around $46 per megawatt hour. So that margin differential and the impact on us is something that we would be mindful of, too, as we look out to the conclusion of a rate case and when new rates would go into effect in the 2016 time frame.

Some of the things we identified, obviously, on the call, just ongoing depreciation, transmission cost. You recall that formerly, we had transmission cost in the FAC but they came out in the last rate case. So as those costs have increased, that's creating lag in the property taxes. And so all of those things are creating headwinds as we roll into 2016. As I mentioned, we've worked very hard, and we have plans in place to offset a good part of that with reductions in year-over-year operations and maintenance cost. Obviously, we don't give all of those details on the pluses and minuses on the call but we did want to provide you some framework reference that net of all of those things and again, if you exclude the Noranda impact but you do it, go ahead and include a normalized level of Callaway refueling cost, we would expect to earn between 50 basis points of that allowed.

In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance",2710,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share, which represents an approximate 7% increase over 2014 results. 
In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 and $2.60, which includes an expected temporary negative impact, reduced sales to Noranda Aluminum. And we are pleased to announce updated rate base growth plans of approximately 6.5%, compounded annually from 2015 through 2020, which is expected to drive earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 through 2020, excluding the impact of Noranda on 2016 earnings. 
We will discuss these earnings expectations further in a moment. Moving back to 2015 results, the strong 2015 earnings growth, compared to 2014, reflected increased FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery earnings, resulting from infrastructure investments made under constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center and disciplined cost management. These positive variances were partially offset by lower retail electric and natural gas sales volumes, driven by very mild fourth quarter 2015 winter temperatures. 
The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower allowed returns on equity and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Marty will discuss these and other 2015 earnings drivers in a few minutes. 
Turning to Page 5, I'd like to share my perspectives on our 2015 performance. Overall, I believe we delivered strong results for our shareholders and customers in 2015, despite facing several challenges. These results were driven by successfully executing our strategic plan. Starting with our focus on prudently investing in and operating our rate-regulated utilities, we continued to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks in order to enhance great reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage. 
In fact, we invested $1.9 billion in utility infrastructure last year, with almost 70% or $1.3 billion that is going to projects in our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses. A significant portion of these investments was made in the Illinois Rivers project, where construction is proceeding according to plan with work on the 9 line segments and 10 substations well underway, and some portions already complete. 
The strategic allocation of capital and effective execution of this project, coupled with disciplined cost management, contributed to a higher consolidated earned return on equity. And this was accomplished while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving down the page, we also achieved constructive December rate orders in both our Illinois electric delivery update and natural gas delivery rate cases. Further, we should not forget that earlier in 2015, we were successful in our advocacy efforts to extend Illinois modernized electric regulatory framework through the end of 2019. That extension have strong bipartisan support because Illinois' regulatory framework is encouraging greater investment and infrastructure, which in turn, is delivering better reliability, a more efficient, modernized grid and significant job creation at reasonable cost to customers. 
Since 2011, even with the substantial infrastructure investments we have made, Ameren Illinois residential electric delivery prices have increased at a compound annual rate, which is less than 2.5%. Simply put, the Illinois framework is a win-win for customers, the state of Illinois and shareholders. 
Overall, efforts within each regulatory jurisdictions to create and capitalize on investments for the benefit of customers and shareholders are showing positive results.  In 2015, we improved distribution system reliability and continued our solid base load energy center performance. And our strong operating performance, combined with the fact that our rates remain well below regional and national averages, contributed to improve customer satisfaction. The bottom line is that we are working every day to provide safer and more reliable service to our customers, and we achieved this in 2015 despite challenging year-end weather conditions, including unprecedented flooding and an ice storm. 
While I'm pleased with the results we delivered in 2015, I am particularly pretty pleased that our team's successful execution of our strategy over the last 3 calendar years has delivered a pure leading total shareholder return of approximately 60%. As a result, and looking ahead, we are going to stay the course and remain focused on executing this strategy. 
Turning now to Page 6 and our 2016 earnings outlook. We anticipate 2016 earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The primary drivers of the variance between 2015 actual results and our 2016 guidance range are noted on this page, and Marty will cover these in more detail a bit later. I want to highlight that our 2016 guidance includes an estimated $0.13 per share reduction in net earnings anticipated to result from significantly lower electric sales in Noranda. I want to spend a few moments on this unique and temporary headwind that we face. 
Moving to Page 7, here, we summarize key facts about Noranda's current situation and why we fully expects its impact on Ameren Missouri to be temporary. First, you should know that Noranda operates an aluminum smelter in Southeast Missouri, and they are our largest customer. On January 8, 2016, Noranda announced that production have been idled at 2 of the 3 pot lines in its smelter operation following an electric supply circuit failure. The circuit failure did not occur on assets owned by Ameren Missouri. Further, on February 8, 2016, Noranda and its subseries filed voluntary petitions for restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code due to operating issues as well as very challenging global aluminum market conditions. At that time, Noranda stated that it expected to curtail all remaining operations at its smelter this March, although it would remain the flexibility to restart operations should conditions allow. 
While we are working closely with Noranda and other key stakeholders on legislation to provide Noranda with long-term, globally competitive electric rates, we can't predict at this time whether it will restart its smelter operations. As a result, our 2016 earnings guidance assumes Noranda will not restart any of its pot lines this year. We can and will take actions to mitigate the financial impacts of Noranda's outage on Ameren Missouri. Those actions may include seeking recovery of lost revenues in the context of electric rate case or filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission for an Accounting Authority Order. At a minimum, in Ameren Missouri's next electric rate case, we expect the Missouri commission would accurately reflect Noranda's ongoing sales volumes, thereby removing the related drag on our prospective earnings. Pending conclusion of the Missouri legislative process, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case this year in order to earn a fair return on investments made to serve customers. As a result, we fully expect the earnings impact from Noranda's lower sales be temporary. 
Turning to Page 8, here we note key areas of focus for 2016 as we continue to execute our strategy. Our FERC-regulated transmission businesses will advance to regional multi-value and local reliability projects included in our capital investment plan. In addition, we will continue to work to obtain constructive outcomes in the complaint cases pending at the FERC exceed to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. In late December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order in the initial complaint case recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE. We expect a final FERC order in that case in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Moving to Illinois electric and natural gas delivery, Ameren Illinois will continue to invest in infrastructure improvements to upgrade systems to enhance reliability and safety, including those under its Modernization Action Plan. This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019, including approximately 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters this year. 
Turning now to Missouri, where modernizing their regulatory framework remains a high priority. We have been actively engaged in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders, including other Missouri investor-owned utilities to build support for legislation that would modernize Missouri's existing regulatory framework. An improved framework will allow us to increase investments to replace and upgrade aging Missouri energy infrastructure to enhance reliability and customer service and to retain and create jobs. Earlier this month, Senate Bill 1028 and identical House Bill 2495 were filed with the intention of accomplishing these objectives. I will touch more on this legislation in a moment. 
Finally, in another regulatory matter, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a new Ameren Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan will begin March 1 this year and continue through February 2019, and follows on the heels of our very successful 3-year energy efficiency plan completed at the end of last year. We believe the new plan, which reflected an agreement between Ameren Missouri and other key stakeholders, appropriately balances customer and shareholder interest. We accomplished this by providing for timely recovery of both energy efficiency program costs and revenue losses resulting from these programs. In addition, the plan provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn performance-incentive revenues, which would be $27 million if 100% of the energy efficiency goals are achieved during the 3-year period, with any such revenues recognized after the plan concluded. 
Regarding Ameren-wide initiatives for 2016, as you know, the U.S. Supreme Court recently stayed the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The state blocks the plan's implementation until its legality is determined by the courts. A 3-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is scheduled to hear legal challenges to the Clean Power Plan beginning on June 2 of this year. We agree with the Supreme Court's decision. It is in the best interest of our customers and the communities we serve because we believe it's important to know whether this rule will extend legal challenges before steps are taken to implement it. Of course, we can't predict the outcome of these legal challenges. We remain committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. As a result, we will continue to advocate the responsible energy policies related to the EPA's Clean Power Plan while working with key stakeholders to address important issues associated with the Missouri and Illinois state implementation plans should the Clean Power Plan ultimately be upheld. 
Finally, we will continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation with the goal of earning at or close to our allowed ROEs. 
Turning to Page 9, I would now like to discus the recently introduced Missouri legislation. Senate Bill 1028 and identical House Bill 2495 would modernize Missouri's regulatory framework to support and encourage investment in aging energy infrastructure for all Missouri investor-owned electric utilities for the benefit of their customers. The proposed legislation calls for timely recovery of actual, prudently incurred costs of providing service to customer, but would also provide long-term, globally competitive electric rates for energy intensive customers like Noranda. Further, this legislation would include several customer benefits, including earnings caps and rate stabilization mechanism as well as provide incentives for utilities to achieve certain performance standard. Ultimately, passage of this legislation would be an important step forward for the state of Missouri. This legislation would spur investment in aging infrastructure, support incremental investments in physical and cybersecurity, support environmental upgrades and cleaner generation sources as well as position Missouri's grid for growth in the future at a time when interest rates remain very low. All this would be done by providing more stable and predictable rates for customers and other appropriate safeguards under the strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. Importantly, this legislation will create and retain jobs throughout the state of Missouri. It is a win-win for all stakeholders. 
In upcoming weeks, we expect that additional language which will be added to the bills as consensus building is advanced and the bills move through the legislative process. As a result, it would be premature to go through the specific details of the legislation at this time. We are pleased that both Senate and House leadership are supporting this legislation, including key leaders of the Senate Commerce committee and the House utilities committee. Of course, and as you know, the legislative process is complex and lengthy. We continue to work with key stakeholders to advance this legislation in a thoughtful, yet timely fashion. The legislation session ends on May 13, 2016. 
Moving on to Page 10, our long-term total return outlook. In February of last year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a 6% compound annual rate for the 2014 through 2019 period. Today, we are rolling forward our multi-year plan, and I am very pleased to see that we expect to grow rate base at an even higher, approximately 6.5% compound annual rate over the new 2015 through 2020 period. I want to be clear that our new rate base growth outlook incorporates the effects of the recent 5-year extension of bonus tax depreciation. You will recall that late last year, we noted that we were evaluating bringing forward into our new 5-year investment plan certain reliability projects, which totaled between $500 million and $1 billion. Our team ultimately brought forward an excess of $1.5 billion of additional Ameren Illinois energy delivery and transmission reliability projects that have now been incorporated into our updated 5-year plan. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, we are allocating significant and growing amounts of capital to our FERC-regulated transmission businesses and Illinois delivery utilities, in line with our strategy. Our list of transmission project is projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by approximately 20% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2020 period. In addition, our Ameren Illinois investments are expected to result from projected natural gas an electric delivery compound annual rate base growth of 11% and 6%, respectively, over this period. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. This level of Missouri growth incorporates increased mandatory environmental expenditures associated with coal combustion residuals. 
Our updated 5-year capital expenditure plan illustrates Ameren's strong pipeline of investment opportunities to address aging infrastructure and reliability needs that we have discussed with you previously. The projects that we have brought forward enable us to take advantage of the cash flow stimulus benefits of bonus tax depreciation for the benefit of customers and to more than offset the effects of bonus depreciation and projected rate base. The utility infrastructure investments and projected rate base growth I just discussed would not only bring superior value to our customers, but also to our shareholders. 
We expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate for 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net negative effect on 2016 earnings of $0.13 per share as a result of lower sales in Noranda. And we expect this growth will compare well with our regulated utility peers. Further, we continue to expect compound annual earnings growth for the 2013 through 2018 period within the range of 7% to 10%. 
Looking ahead, we will also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. The Board of Directors decision to increase the dividend by 3.7% last October for the second consecutive year reflected its confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings and rate base growth plan. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board, and I'm firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us on today's call.  I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

We were pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that",2330,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everybody. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share compared to earnings of $2.40 per share for the prior year. We were pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that were just above the mid-point of our initial 2015 guidance we provided early last year despite some significant headwinds in the fourth quarter, including extremely mild temperatures and the extension of bonus tax depreciation. As you can see, there were no difference between GAAP and core results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Moving then to Page 13, here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.16 per share increase in 2015 results. Key factors included increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our Illinois and ATXI businesses, which increased earnings by $0.20 per share compared to 2014. 
In addition, the earnings comparison benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center, which cost $0.09 in 2014. These refueling outages are scheduled to occur every 18 months. Further, earlier last year, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved recovery of certain Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage cost, and this had a positive effect on the earnings comparison. Earnings also benefited from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower-cost debt. Finally, as Warner mentioned, we continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including managing costs in a disciplined manner. 
Reflecting this, 2015 other operations and maintenance expenses declined compared to the prior year for our Missouri utility. Factors having an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons included lower retail electric and natural gas sales, driven by mild weather. Weather effects decreased full year 2015 earnings by an estimated $0.06 per share compared to 2014. The unfavorable earnings impact of very mild fourth quarter 2015 temperatures is estimated to have been $0.08 versus normal, which more than offset an estimated $0.05 per share favorable impact of weather experienced over the first 9 months of 2015. Heating degree days were down about 30% versus normal fourth quarter levels. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers were flat year-over-year, while such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased about 1%. 
The decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan compensated for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from energy efficiency programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by about 0.25%. For 2015, kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois' and Missouri's industrial customers decreased approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, primarily reflecting lower sales to large, low-margin Illinois customers in agriculture and steelmaking as well as lower sales in Missouri to Noranda. 
Moving back to the discussion of 2015 results, the year-over-year earnings comparison was unfavorably affected by lower capitalized Ameren Missouri financing cost of $0.06 per share, due to a larger balance of infrastructure projects in process and ultimately, placed in service during 2015. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower recognized allowed ROEs, which reduced the contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois by a total of $0.05 per share. 
Since 2014, our transmission earnings have been reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. In addition, 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporated an 8.64% allowed ROE compared to 9.14% in 2014. This decline was due to a decrease in the annual average 30-year treasury rate from 3.34% to 2.84%. The 2015 earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by increased depreciation and amortization expenses of $0.05 per share and finally, by the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption cost. 
Turning to Page 14 of our presentation. Next, I would like to discuss details of our 2016 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.60, including an estimated $0.13 reduction related to significantly lower expected sales volumes to Noranda compared to 2015. This estimated earnings impact is net of expected revenues from off-system sales that Ameren Missouri makes as a result of reduced sales to Noranda. Revenues from these off-system sales are allowed to be retained under a provision in the fuel adjustment clause. This estimate incorporates such off-system sales in and around the clock indie hub power price, net of an estimated basis differential, reflecting the location of our energy centers. Further, we assume that the 2 of Noranda's 3 smelter pot lines that were out -- idled in early January remain out of service, that the third pot line is idled in March as Noranda has indicated, and that all 3 of these production lines remain idled for the balance of the year. 
Finally, as of February 8 of this year, the date Noranda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Noranda had prepaid an amount to Ameren Missouri that exceeded its utility service usage. Ameren Missouri expects to be paid in full for utility services provided after February 8, 2016.  
With this overview, I will now walk through key 2016 earnings drivers and assumptions for each of our businesses.
Like 2015 results, expected 2016 earnings reflect increases in FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base, which are noted on this page. Our projected 2016 electric transmission earnings continued to include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO base allowed ROE but also incorporate the 50 basis point adder FERC has authorized because of our MISO membership. Further, expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula-based ROE of 9% using a forecast of 3.2% for the 2016 average 30-year treasury bond yield. For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, earnings will reflect new rates that incorporate the higher rate base levels and increased cost included in the 2016 future test year utilized to determine those rates as well as the higher return on equity authorized in the December rate order. 
Shifting to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery earnings will reflect the absence in 2015 of $0.04 per share related to the ICC order approving the recovery of power usage cost that I mentioned earlier. 
Before we move on, I do want to highlight that we recognize that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formula ratemaking and pending MISO complaint case. Therefore, on this page, we have provided estimates of 2016 earnings per share sensitivities associated with hypothetical changes in allowed ROEs. 
Turning now to Page 15 and 2016 key drivers and assumptions related to Ameren Missouri earnings. The year-over-year earnings comparison is expected to be unfavorably affected by the already discussed estimated net earnings decline related to lower sales to Noranda. Further, as we noted on our earnings call in November, we expect Ameren Missouri's highly successful 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency program to reduce sales levels in 2016, negatively impacting earnings compared to last year. A portion of this impact will be offset by a performance incentive, subject to commission approval. I want to note that Ameren Missouri's new plan, which Warner mentioned, and which becomes effective March 1, will not mitigate the unfavorable effects on 2016 earnings, resulting from the prior energy efficiency plan. There are certain key differences between the Missouri energy efficiency program that ended in 2015 and the new program that begins next month. 
The 2013 through 2015 program compensated Ameren Missouri in each of those years for the immediate and longer-term financial impacts of energy efficiency programs initiated in each of those years, which is leading to 2016 financial headwinds. The 2016 through 2019 program is again designed to fully compensate Ameren Missouri for the financial impacts of the energy efficiency programs. However, excluding the potential for performance incentive payment in 2019, in any given year, the impacts are expected to be earnings neutral. The earnings comparison is also expected to be unfavorably affected by Ameren Missouri regulatory lag reflecting depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses that are higher than the levels collected in rates. Finally, a Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016 is expected to reduce earnings by $0.09 per share. 
Shifting now to factors that are expected to favorably affect Ameren Missouri's earnings comparison. We estimate that other operations and maintenance expenses, not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, will decline. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management efforts. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions, but this goal continues to be challenging to -- challenging
[Audio Gap]
Assuming normalized annual level of Callaway refueling outage expenses that exclude the net earnings impact of reduced sales to Noranda, we expect Ameren Missouri to earn within 50 basis points of its 9.53% allowed ROE.
Before I leave the discussion of 2016 expectations for our Illinois and Missouri utilities, I would like to discuss our sales outlook. As noted on Pages 14 and 15, a return to normal temperatures in 2016 would benefit Ameren's earnings by a combined estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2015. We expect combined Illinois and Missouri weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year, partially reflecting the previously mentioned effects of our Missouri energy efficiency programs that ended in 2015, the new 2016 energy efficiency programs as well as energy efficiency programs in Illinois. 
Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be flat to up slightly compared to last year, excluding the anticipated decline in sales to Noranda. 
Moving now to parent and other costs. During the fourth quarter of last year, we issued long-term debt at the Ameren parent company to repay short-term borrowings. While this new long-term debt was issued at a low cost, it will have an unfavorable effect on the 2016 earnings comparison. Further, on an Ameren consolidated basis, we forecast our 2016 effective income tax rate will be about 38%, comparable to the 2015 core effective tax rate. And finally, this earnings guidance reflects no change in average basic common shares outstanding from the prior year level. 
Moving then to Page 16. For 2016, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $790 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of approximately $2.2 billion of planned 2016 capital expenditures, with about 2/3 in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of cash on hand and short and long-term borrowings. 
Turning to Page 17 of the presentation, here, we provide an overview of our $11.1 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2016 through 2020 period. First, let me provide further details on the type of projects included in our strong 5-year growth plan, paying particular focus to those jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. The increased Illinois electric delivery investments will address aging infrastructure and support system capacity additions and reliability improvements. These include substation breaker and transformer replacements, underground residential distribution replacements, line rebuilds, and reconductor projects as well as capacity additions and line hardening. 
Planned investment increases in Illinois natural gas delivery target safety and reliability improvements and consist of gas transmission, coupled steel system and gas storage field compressor replacements as well as regulator station rebuilds and upgrades, and other system rebuilds where conditions warrant. And to added Ameren Illinois local transmission investments will enhance reliability and includes aged and condition-based replacement of structures, shield wire, conductors, transformers, breakers, switches and other equipment. 
Of course, in Missouri, we will continue to make prudent investments to provide safe and adequate service. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of income tax deferrals and tax assets over the 5 years ending in 2020. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures in the recent 5-year extension of bonus tax depreciation, which added about $930 million to this expectation. The tax assets totaled approximately $630 million at year-end 2015, with approximately $430 million of these at the parent company, which are not currently earning a return, and we expect these tax assets to be realized into 2021. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity through this planning period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics, and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Now turning to Page 18, I will summarize. We delivered strong 7% core earnings per share growth in 2015, and we are successfully executing our strategy. We also expect earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate for 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. This earnings growth is driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution, generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdiction for the benefit of our customers. 
When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.7%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Obviously, the key there, the big driver is rate base growth. And as we announced today, we've got 6.5% compound annual rate-based growth planned for the period 2015 to 2020, which obviously is a smack in the middle of that earnings per share growth range as well. And that rate base growth is the foundation. And we'd say that --  I'd say that, that growth rate of 5% to 8% incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions. As you know, that over time, in our planning, we look at consensus estimates for growth in the 30-year treasury rate, which today, I think, economists are expecting it to rise about 200 basis points between now and 2020. But when we look at that growth rate range, it accommodates a number of alternatives, both that increase in treasury rates over time as well as even a low-interest rate environment like the one we're in persisting over this period of time. So it incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions, ROEs, regulatory decisions, changes in economic conditions, et cetera. In terms of sales growth, our -- embedded in our forecast over this time is about flattish sales growth through this period. But for the energy efficiency programs, we would expect to see modest growth. But as a result of the programs that we've got in place, we do expect it to be pretty flattish over this period of time.

And to your point, to the extent that we do have a change in the Missouri regulatory framework, I think we have to step back and assess whether, to the extent that we did have additional capital expenditures, would they be incremental to this growth rate or would we modify the capital expenditure plans we have and still deliver, I'd say, within this 5% to 8% earnings growth range. So look, if that does take place, if there is a change in the framework, we'll step back and we'll update as appropriate."

In terms of the longer term, as I said, it's a 5% to 8% earnings growth target but the foundation, Paul, is the 6.5% rate base growth. And that 6.5% rate base growth, as I said, a smack dab in the middle of that range, and that really anchors that growth. And as I said then, there's a range of treasury rates around it, certainly, not meaning to imply that it was -- we were dependent upon a 200 basis point rise in the treasury to hit the mid-point of that guidance. The upper end of that range, the lower end of that range, incorporates higher treasury rates or perhaps current or lower treasury rates.

Yes, in the call, I think what we're clarified was that there are a couple of different things. One has to do with the temporary nature of this impact. And that ultimately, that it's a temporary impact because as we file a rate case and we incorporate the reduction in sales to Noranda, the net impact would go away in terms of the overall revenue requirements and how our revenues will be formulated in the context for rate case. What an Accounting Authority Order would potentially allow you to do would be able to defer the impact of these loss revenues between now and when rates are reset for a potential recovery of those costs. And we could either do that as an Accounting Authority Order or also, as we pointed out in the call, you could make that request as part of a rate case. So there's a couple of alternatives there. I think one key is that it's not that -- there's really no time limit on that meeting. If you were to file an AAO, it wouldn't just be for prospective impacts. You could also request, and as part of that, to recover the lost revenues from the date the incident first happened forward in time. So there's not really a clock ticking on that. So we'll consider those options. As I said before, certainly, very unfortunate what's happened with Noranda here in January with the outrage. They still have one pot line running. They've announced that they do expect to shut that down. But I think we'll let that play out and see ultimately what does happen and then consider these regulatory options that I just laid out."

So when we look at it, we look at the differential between the rates that Noranda would have been paying and the price that we can get for those kilowatt hours in the wholesale markets. When we look at that and around-the-clock price today at indie hub [ph] is probably around $27 per megawatt hour, but there's also a negative basis differential to our plans. And frankly, over the past couple of years, that's been running 15% to 18% kind of a basis differential. So those are the factors that we'd taken into consideration in the calculation of that expected $0.13 drag on 2016 earnings."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we announced 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share, which represents an approximate 7% increase over 2014 results. In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance",2708,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Today, we announced 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share, which represents an approximate 7% increase over 2014 results. In addition, we established a 2016 earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60, which includes an expected temporary negative impact of reduced sales to Noranda Aluminum. And we are pleased to announce updated rate base growth [ph] plans of approximately 6.5% compounded annually from 2015 through 2020, which is expected to drive earnings per share growth of 5% to 8% compounded annually from 2016 through 2020, excluding the impact of Noranda on 2016 earnings. 
We will discuss these earnings expectations further in a moment. Moving back to 2015 results, the strong 2015 earnings growth, compared to 2014, reflected increased FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery earnings, resulting from infrastructure investments made under constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center and disciplined cost management. These positive variances were partially offset by lower retail electric and natural gas sales volumes, driven by very mild fourth quarter 2015 winter temperatures. 
The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower allowed returns on equity and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Marty will discuss these and other 2015 earnings drivers in a few minutes. 
Turning to Page 5. I'd like to share my perspectives on our 2015 performance. Overall, I believe we delivered strong results for our shareholders and customers in 2015 despite facing several challenges. These results were driven by successfully executing our strategic plan. Starting with our focus on prudently investing in and operating our rate-regulated utilities, we continued to allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses that are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks in order to enhance great reliability and allow customers to better manage their energy usage. 
In fact, we invested $1.9 billion in utility infrastructure last year with almost 70% or $1.3 billion of this going to projects in our FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery businesses. A significant portion of these investments was made in the Illinois Rivers project, where construction's proceeding according to plan with work on the 9 line segments and 10 substations well underway and some portions already complete. 
The strategic allocation of capital and effective execution of these projects coupled with disciplined cost management contributed to a higher consolidated earned return on equity. And this was accomplished while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. 
Moving down the page, we also achieved constructive December rate orders in both our Illinois electric delivery update and natural gas delivery rate cases. Further, we should not forget that earlier in 2015, we were successful in our advocacy efforts to extend Illinois' modernized electric regulatory framework through the end of 2019. That extension had strong bipartisan support because Illinois' regulatory framework is encouraging greater investment in infrastructure, which in turn is delivering better reliability; a more efficient, modernized grid and significant job creation at reasonable cost to customers. 
Since 2011, even with the substantial infrastructure investments we have made, Ameren Illinois' residential electric delivery prices have increased at a compound annual rate, which is less than 2.5%. Simply put, the Illinois framework is a win-win for customers, the state of Illinois and shareholders. 
Overall, efforts within each of our regulatory jurisdictions to create and capitalize on investments for the benefit of customers and shareholders are showing positive results. In 2015, we improved distribution system reliability and continued our solid base load energy center performance. And our strong operating performance, combined with the fact that our rates remain well below regional and national averages, contributed to improve customer satisfaction. The bottom line is that we're working every day to provide safer and more reliable service to our customers, and we achieved this in 2015 despite challenging year-end weather conditions, including unprecedented flooding and an ice storm. 
While I'm pleased with the results we delivered in 2015, I am particularly pleased that our team's successful execution of our strategy over the last 3 calendar years has delivered a peer-leading total shareholder return of approximately 60%. As a result, and looking ahead, we are going to stay the course and remain focused on executing this strategy. 
Turning now to Page 6 and our 2016 earnings outlook. We anticipate 2016 earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The primary drivers of the variance between 2015 actual results and our 2016 guidance range are noted on this page, and Marty will cover these in more detail a bit later. I want to highlight that our 2016 guidance includes an estimated $0.13 per share reduction in net earnings anticipated to result from significantly lower electric sales to Noranda. I want to spend a few moments on this unique and temporary headwind that we face. 
Moving to Page 7. Here, we summarize key facts about Noranda's current situation and why we fully expect its impact on Ameren Missouri to be temporary. First, you should know that Noranda operates an aluminum smelter in Southeast Missouri, and they are our largest customer. On January 8, 2016, Noranda announced that production had been idled at 2 of the 3 pot lines at its smelter operation following an electric supply circuit failure. The circuit failure did not occur on assets owned by Ameren Missouri. Further, on February 8, 2016, Noranda and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code due to operating issues as well as very challenging global aluminum market conditions. At that time, Noranda stated that it expected to curtail all remaining operations at its smelter this March, although, it would remain the flexibility to restart operations should conditions allow. 
While we're working closely with Noranda and other key stakeholders on legislation to provide Noranda with long-term, globally competitive electric rates, we can't predict at this time whether it will restart its smelter operations. As a result, our 2016 earnings guidance assumes Noranda will not restart any of its pot lines this year. We can and will take actions to mitigate the financial impacts of Noranda's outage on Ameren Missouri. Those actions may include seeking recovery of lost revenues in the context on electric rate case or filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission for an Accounting Authority Order. At a minimum, in Ameren Missouri's next electric rate case, we expect the Missouri commission would accurately reflect Noranda's ongoing sales volumes, thereby removing the related drag on our prospective earnings. Pending conclusion of the Missouri legislative process, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case this year in order to earn a fair return on investments made to serve customers. As a result, we fully expect the earnings impact from Noranda's lower sales be temporary. 
Turning to Page 8. Here we note key areas of focus for 2016 as we continue to execute our strategy. Our FERC-regulated transmission businesses will advance to regional multi-value and local reliability projects included in our capital investment plan. In addition, we will continue to work to obtain constructive outcomes in the complaint cases pending that the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed ROE from MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. In late December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order in the initial complaint case recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE. We expect a final FERC order in that case in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Moving to Illinois electric and natural gas delivery, Ameren Illinois will continue to invest in infrastructure improvements to upgrade systems to enhance reliability and safety, including those under its Modernization Action Plan. This plan includes the installation of approximately 780,000 advanced electric meters and the upgrading of approximately 470,000 gas meters by the end of 2019, including approximately 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters this year. 
Turning now to Missouri, where modernizing their regulatory framework remains a high priority. We have been actively engaged in discussions with customers, legislators, state officials and other stakeholders, including other Missouri investor-owned utilities to build support for legislation that would modernize Missouri's existing regulatory framework. An improved framework will allow us to increase investment to replace and upgrade aging Missouri energy infrastructure to enhance reliability and customer service and to retain and create jobs. Earlier this month, Senate Bill 1028 and identical House Bill 2495 were filed with the intention of accomplishing these objectives. I will touch more on this legislation in a moment. 
Finally, in another regulatory matter, last week, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a new Ameren Missouri energy efficiency plan. This plan will begin March 1 this year and continue through February 2019, and follows on the heels of our very successful 3-year energy efficiency plan completed at the end of last year. We believe the new plan, which reflected an agreement between Ameren Missouri and other key stakeholders, appropriately balances customer and shareholder interest. We accomplished this by providing for timely recovery of both energy efficiency program costs and revenue losses resulting from these programs. In addition, the plan provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn performance-incentive revenues, which would be $27 million if 100% of the energy efficiency goals are achieved during the 3-year period with any such revenues recognized after the plan concluded. 
Regarding Ameren-wide initiatives for 2016, as you know, the U.S. Supreme Court recently stayed the EPA's Clean Power Plan. This stay blocks the plan's implementation until its legality is determined by the courts. A 3-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is scheduled to hear legal challenges to the Clean Power Plan beginning on June 2 of this year. 
We agree with the Supreme Court's decision. It is in the best interest of our customers and the communities we serve because we believe it is important to know whether this rule will withstand legal challenges before steps are taken to implement it. Of course, we can't predict the outcome of these legal challenges. We remain committed to transitioning to a cleaner, more fuel diverse generation portfolio in a responsible fashion. As a result, we will continue to advocate for responsible energy policies related to the EPA's Clean Power Plan while working with key stakeholders to address important issues associated with the Missouri and Illinois state implementation plans should the Clean Power Plan ultimately be upheld. 
Finally, we'll continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation with the goal of earning at or close to our allowed ROEs. 
Turning to Page 9. I would now like to discus the recently introduced Missouri legislation. Senate Bill 1028 and identical House Bill 2495 would modernize Missouri's regulatory framework to support and encourage investment in aging energy infrastructure for all Missouri investor-owned electric utilities for the benefit of their customers. The proposed legislation calls for timely recovery of actual, prudently incurred costs for providing service to customers. It would also provide long-term globally competitive electric rates for energy-intensive customers like Noranda. Further, this legislation would include several customer benefits, including earnings caps and rate stabilization mechanism as well as provide incentives for utilities to achieve certain performance standards. 
Ultimately, passage of this legislation would be an important step forward for the state of Missouri. This legislation would spur investment in aging infrastructure, support incremental investments in physical and cybersecurity, support environmental upgrades and cleaner generation sources, as well as position Missouri's grid for growth in the future at a time when interest rates remain very low. All this would be done while providing more stable and predictable rates for customers and other appropriate safeguards under the strong oversight by the Missouri Public Service Commission. Importantly, this legislation will create and retain jobs throughout the state of Missouri. It is a win-win for all stakeholders. 
In upcoming weeks, we expect that additional language will be added to the bills as consensus building is advanced and the bills move through the legislative process. As a result, it would be premature to go through the specific details of the legislation at this time. We are pleased that both Senate and House leadership are supporting this legislation, including key leaders of the Senate Commerce committee and the House utilities committee. Of course, and as you know, the legislative process is complex and lengthy. We continue to work with key stakeholders to advance this legislation in a thoughtful yet timely fashion. The legislation session ends on May 13, 2016. 
Moving on to Page 10 and our long-term total return outlook. In February of last year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a 6% compound annual rate for the 2014 through 2019 period. Today, we are rolling forward our multiyear plan, and I am very pleased to say that we expect to grow rate base at an even higher, approximately 6.5% compound annual rate over the new 2015 through 2020 period. I want to be clear that our new rate base growth outlook incorporates the effects of the recent 5-year extension of bonus tax depreciation. You will recall that late last year, we noted that we were evaluating bringing forward into our new 5-year investment plan certain reliability projects which totaled between $500 million and $1 billion. Our team ultimately brought forward an excess of $1.5 billion of additional Ameren Illinois energy delivery and transmission reliability projects that have now been incorporated into our updated 5-year plan. 
As you can see on the right side of this page, we are allocating significant and growing amounts of capital to our FERC-regulated transmission businesses and Illinois delivery utilities in line with our strategy. Our list of transmission projects is projected to increase FERC-regulated rate base by approximately 20% compounded annually over the 2016 through 2020 period. In addition, our Ameren Illinois investments are expected to result from projected natural gas and electric delivery compound annual rate base growth of 11% and 6%, respectively, over this period. And finally, our Missouri rate base is expected to grow at a slower 2% compound annual rate. This level of Missouri growth incorporates increased mandatory environmental expenditures associated with coal combustion residuals. 
Our updated 5-year capital expenditure plan illustrates Ameren's strong pipeline of investment opportunities to address aging infrastructure and reliability needs that we have discussed with you previously. The projects we have brought forward enable us to take advantage of the cash flow stimulus benefits of bonus tax depreciation for the benefit of customers and to more than offset the effects of bonus depreciation and projected rate base. The utility infrastructure investments and projected rate base growth I just discussed would not only bring superior value to our customers but also to our shareholders. 
We expect earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net negative effect on 2016 earnings of $0.13 per share as a result of lower sales to Noranda. And we expect this growth will compare well with our regulated utility peers. Further, we continue to expect compound annual earnings growth for the 2013 through 2018 period within the range of 7% to 10%. 
Looking ahead, we will also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. The Board of Directors decision to increase the dividend by 3.7% last October for the second consecutive year reflected its confidence in the outlook for our regulated businesses and our ability to achieve our long-term earnings and rate base growth plan. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows, and economic and other business conditions. 
To summarize, we are successfully executing our strategy across the board, and I'm firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us on today's call.  I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

We were pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that",2330,"Thank you, Warner. Good morning, everybody. Turning now to Page 12 of our presentation. Today, we reported 2015 core earnings of $2.56 per share compared to earnings of $2.40 per share for the prior year. We were pleased to achieve core 2015 earnings that were just above the midpoint of our initial 2015 guidance we provided early last year despite some significant headwinds in the fourth quarter, including extremely mild temperatures and the extension of bonus tax depreciation. As you can see, there were no difference between GAAP and core results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Moving then to Page 13, here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.16 per share increase in 2015 results. Key factors included increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our Illinois and ATXI businesses, which increased earnings by $0.20 per share compared to 2014. 
In addition, the earnings comparison benefited from the absence in 2015 of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway energy center, which cost $0.09 in 2014. These refueling outages are scheduled to occur every 18 months. Further, earlier last year, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved recovery of certain Ameren Illinois cumulative power usage costs, and this had a positive effect on the earnings comparison. Earnings also benefited from a reduction in parent company interest charges, reflecting the May 2014 maturity of $425 million of 8.875% senior notes that were replaced with lower-cost debt. Finally, as Warner mentioned, we continue our ongoing efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including managing cost in a disciplined manner. 
Reflecting this, 2015 other operations and maintenance expenses declined compared to the prior year for our Missouri utility. Factors having an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons included lower retail electric and natural gas sales driven by mild weather. Weather effects decreased full year 2015 earnings by an estimated $0.06 per share compared to 2014. The unfavorable earnings impact of very mild fourth quarter 2015 temperatures is estimated to have been $0.08 versus normal, which more than offset an estimated $0.05 per share favorable impact of weather experienced over the first 9 months of 2015. Heating degree days were down about 30% versus normal fourth quarter levels. We estimate that weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers were flat year-over-year, while such sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers decreased about 1%. 
The decrease in Missouri sales was driven by the residential sector. It is important to note that Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan compensated for the negative earnings effects of reduced electric sales volumes resulting from energy efficiency programs. Excluding the effects of these programs, we estimate that sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers would have increased by about 0.25%. For 2015, kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois' and Missouri's industrial customers decreased approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, primarily reflecting lower sales to large, low-margin Illinois customers in agriculture and steelmaking as well as lower sales in Missouri to Noranda. 
Moving back to the discussion of 2015 results, the year-over-year earnings comparison was unfavorably affected by lower capitalized Ameren Missouri financing costs of $0.06 per share due to a larger balance of infrastructure projects in process and ultimately placed in service during 2014. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by lower recognized allowed ROEs, which reduced the contributions from electric transmission and delivery investments at ATXI and Ameren Illinois by a total of $0.05 per share. 
Since 2014, our transmission earnings have been reduced by a reserve to reflect the potential for a lower allowed ROE as a result of the pending complaint cases at the FERC. In addition, 2015 Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporated an 8.64% allowed ROE compared to 9.14% in 2014. This decline was due to a decrease in the annual average 30-year Treasury rate from 3.34% to 2.84%. The 2015 earnings comparison was also unfavorably affected by increased depreciation and amortization expenses of $0.05 per share and, finally, by the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory decision authorizing Ameren Illinois to recover previously disallowed debt redemption costs. 
Turning to Page 14 of our presentation. Next, I would like to discuss details of our 2016 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.60, including an estimated $0.13 reduction related to significantly lower expected sales volumes to Noranda compared to 2015. This estimated earnings impact is net of expected revenues from off-system sales that Ameren Missouri makes as a result of reduced sales to Noranda. Revenues from these off-system sales are allowed to be retained under a provision in the fuel adjustment clause. This estimate incorporates such off-system sales in an around-the-clock indie hub power price net of an estimated basis differential reflecting the location of our energy centers. Further, we assume that the 2 of Noranda's 3 smelter pot lines that were -- idled in early January remain out of service, that the third pot line is idled in March as Noranda has indicated, and that all 3 of these production lines remain idled for the balance of the year. 
Finally, as of February 8 of this year, the date Noranda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Noranda had prepaid an amount to Ameren Missouri that exceeded its utility service usage. Ameren Missouri expects to be paid in full for utility services provided after February 8, 2016.  
With this overview, I will now walk through key 2016 earnings drivers and assumptions for each of our businesses. Like 2015 results, expected 2016 earnings reflect increases in FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric delivery rate base, which are noted on this page. Our projected 2016 electric transmission earnings continued to include a reserve for a potential reduction in the current MISO base allowed ROE but also incorporate the 50 basis point adder FERC has authorized because of our MISO membership. Further, expected Illinois electric delivery earnings incorporate a formula-based ROE of 9% using a forecast of 3.2% for the 2016 average 30-year Treasury bond yield. For Ameren Illinois gas delivery service, earnings will reflect new rates that incorporate the higher rate base levels and increased cost included in the 2016 future test year utilized to determine those rates as well as the higher return on equity authorized in the December rate order. 
Shifting to a comparatively unfavorable item, Ameren Illinois electric delivery earnings will reflect the absence in 2016 of $0.04 per share related to the ICC order approving the recovery of power usage costs that I mentioned earlier. 
Before we move on, I do want to highlight that we recognize that investors are interested in understanding the sensitivity of our outlook to changes in our allowed ROEs given our formula ratemaking and pending MISO complaint case. Therefore, on this page, we have provided estimates of 2016 earnings per share sensitivities associated with hypothetical changes in allowed ROEs. 
Turning now to Page 15 and 2016 key drivers and assumptions related to Ameren Missouri earnings. The year-over-year earnings comparison is expected to be unfavorably affected by the already discussed estimated net earnings decline related to lower sales to Noranda. Further, as we noted on our earnings call in November, we expect Ameren Missouri's highly successful 2013 to 2015 energy efficiency program to reduce sales levels in 2016, negatively impacting earnings compared to last year. A portion of this impact will be offset by a performance incentive subject to commission approval. I want to note that Ameren Missouri's new plan, which Warner mentioned and which becomes effective March 1, will not mitigate the unfavorable effects on 2016 earnings, resulting from the prior energy efficiency plan. There are certain key differences between the Missouri energy efficiency program that ended in 2015 and the new program that begins next month. 
The 2013 through 2015 program compensated Ameren Missouri in each of those years for the immediate and longer-term financial impacts of energy efficiency programs initiated in each of those years, which is leading to 2016 financial headwinds. The 2016 through 2019 program is again designed to fully compensate Ameren Missouri for the financial impacts of the energy efficiency programs. However, excluding the potential for a performance incentive payment in 2019, in any given year, the impacts are expected to be earnings neutral. The earnings comparison is also expected to be unfavorably affected by Ameren Missouri regulatory lag reflecting depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses that are higher than the levels collected in rates. Finally, a Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the spring of 2016 is expected to reduce earnings by $0.09 per share. 
Shifting now to factors that are expected to favorably affect Ameren Missouri's earnings comparison. We estimate that other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms will decline. This expectation is the result of our lean continuous improvement and disciplined cost management efforts. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions, but this goal continues to be challenging to -- challenging 
[Audio Gap] 
assuming normalized annual level of Callaway refueling outage expenses that exclude the net earnings impact of reduced sales to Noranda, we expect Ameren Missouri to earn within [ph] 50 basis points of its 9.53% allowed ROE.
Before I leave the discussion of 2016 expectations for our Illinois and Missouri utilities, I would like to discuss our sales outlook. As noted on Pages 14 and 15, a return to normal temperatures in 2016 would benefit Ameren's earnings by a combined estimated $0.03 per share compared to 2015. We expect combined Illinois and Missouri weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers to be roughly flat compared to last year, partially reflecting the previously mentioned effects of our Missouri energy efficiency programs that ended in 2015, the new 2016 energy efficiency programs as well as energy efficiency programs in Illinois. 
Turning to industrial customers, combined Illinois and Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to this group are expected to be flat to up slightly compared to last year, excluding the anticipated decline in sales to Noranda. 
Moving now to parent and other costs. During the fourth quarter of last year, we issued long-term debt at the Ameren parent company to repay short-term borrowings. While this new long-term debt was issued at a low cost, it will have an unfavorable effect on the 2016 earnings comparison. Further, on an Ameren consolidated basis, we forecast our 2016 effective income tax rate will be about 38%, comparable to the 2015 core effective tax rate. And finally, this earnings guidance reflects no change in average basic common shares outstanding from the prior year level. 
Moving then to Page 16. For 2016, we anticipate negative free cash flow of approximately $790 million. On the right side of this page, we provide a breakdown of our approximately $2.2 billion of planned 2016 capital expenditures with about 2/3 in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks. We expect to fund this year's negative free cash flow and debt maturities with a mix of cash on hand and short- and long-term borrowings. 
Turning to Page 17 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $11.1 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2016 through 2020 period. First, let me provide further details on the type of projects included in our strong 5-year growth plan, paying particular focus to those jurisdictions with modern constructive regulatory frameworks. The increased Illinois electric delivery investments will address aging infrastructure and support system capacity additions and reliability improvements. These include substation breaker and transformer replacements, underground residential distribution replacements, line rebuilds and reconductor projects, as well as capacity additions and line hardening. 
Planned investment increases in Illinois natural gas delivery target safety and reliability improvements and consist of gas transmission, coupled steel system and gas storage field compressor replacements as well as regulator station rebuilds and upgrades and other system rebuilds where conditions warrant. And to added Ameren Illinois local transmission investments will enhance reliability and include age and condition-based replacement of structures, shield wire, conductors, transformers, breakers, switches and other equipment. 
Of course, in Missouri, we will continue to make prudent investments to provide safe and adequate service. The expected funding sources for these infrastructure investments are listed on this page. In particular, we expect to benefit from approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of income tax deferrals and tax assets over the 5 years ending in 2020. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by our planned capital expenditures in the recent 5-year extension of bonus tax depreciation, which added about $930 million to this expectation. The tax assets totaled approximately $630 million at year-end 2015, with approximately $430 million of these at the parent company, which are not currently earning a return, and we expect these tax assets to be realized into 2021. Given our expected funding sources, we do not expect to issue additional equity through this planning period. We remain committed to funding our capital expenditures in a manner that maintains solid credit metrics, and this is reflected in our capitalization target of around 50% equity. 
Now turning to Page 18. I will summarize. We delivered strong 7% core earnings per share growth in 2015, and we are successfully executing our strategy. We also expect earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. This earnings growth is driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution, generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdiction for the benefit of our customers. 
When you combine our superior earnings growth outlook with Ameren's dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.7%, we believe our common stock represents a very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And as we announced today, we've got 6.5% compound annual rate base growth planned for the period 2015 to 2020, which obviously is smack in the middle of that earnings per share growth range as well. And that rate base growth is the foundation. And we'd say that --  I'd say that, that growth rate of 5% to 8% incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of Treasury rate assumptions. As you know, that over time, in our planning, we look at consensus estimates for growth in the 30-year Treasury rate, which today, I think, economists are expecting it to rise about 200 basis points between now and 2020. But when we look at that growth rate range, it accommodates a number of alternatives, both that increase in Treasury rates over time as well as even a low interest rate environment like the one we're in persisting over this period of time. So it incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions, ROEs, regulatory decisions, changes in economic conditions, et cetera. In terms of sales growth, our -- embedded in our forecast over this time is about flattish sales growth through this period. But for the energy efficiency programs, we would expect to see modest growth. But as a result of the programs that we've got in place, we do expect it to be pretty flattish over this period of time.

Yes, in the call, I think what we're clarified was that there are a couple different things. One has to do with the temporary nature of this impact. And that ultimately, that it's a temporary impact because, as we file a rate case and we incorporate the reduction in sales to Noranda, the net impact would go away in terms of the overall revenue requirements and how our revenues will be formulated in the context for rate case. What an Accounting Authority Order would potentially allow you to do would be able to defer the impact of these lost revenues between now and when rates are reset for a potential recovery of those costs. And we could either do that as an Accounting Authority Order or also, as we pointed out in the call, you could make that request as part of a rate case. So there's a couple of alternatives there. I think one key is that it's not that -- there's really no time limit on that meeting. If you were to file an AAO, it wouldn't just be for prospective impacts. You could also request as part of that, to recover the lost revenues from the date the incident first happened forward in time. So there's not really a clock ticking on that. So we'll consider those options. As I said before, certainly, very unfortunate what's happened with Noranda here in January with the outage. They still have one pot line running. They've announced that they do expect to shut that down. But I think we'll let that play out and see ultimately what does happen and then consider these regulatory options that I just laid out."

To the extent it does occur, it may not occur in 2016. But again, to the extent you requested this as part of a rate case, would be more likely that to the extent that those -- the collection of those revenues was granted by the commission, that, that earnings impact would be reflected in 2017."

I think that the objective there is to file the outline to give stakeholders the ability to provide input into certain approaches that may be utilized in the bill. And so that's really where things stand today. I think the outline is pretty clear in some of the areas that will be covered, but the specifics are still being worked out. And so I think, as you saw, we talked about, we're clearly going to be focused on issues around addressing regulatory lag, especially those associated with investment. That's outlined in the bill. Certainly, important consumer benefits, whether it be in the forms of earnings caps, rate caps or even performance standards, similar to types of things we've seen successfully employed in Illinois. And I think importantly, what's embedded in all of that is strong oversight will continue by Missouri Public Service Commission. So it would be premature to go into details. I think those kind of specifics that are reflected in the bill, as it stands today, I would expect to see in the bill when it's filed in its entirety.

So over this period of time, we're looking to spend at any given year, I'd say anywhere between that $2.155 billion up to about $2.350 billion, about $2,350,000,000 over this period of time. And obviously, again, trying to achieve, as best we can, steady rate base growth through time. Obviously, in Missouri, where you've got periodic rate cases, it can be a little bit lumpier.

You recall that, formerly, we had transmission cost in the FAC, but they came out in the last rate case. So as those costs have increased, that's creating lag in the property taxes. And so all of those things are creating headwinds as we roll into 2016. As I mentioned, we've worked very hard, and we have plans in place to offset a good part of that with reductions in year-over-year operations and maintenance cost. Obviously, we don't give all of those details on the pluses and minuses on the call but did want to provide you some frame of reference that, net of all of those things and again, if you exclude the Noranda impact but you do it, go ahead and include a normalized level of Callaway refueling cost that we would expect to earn 50 basis points of that allowed.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in last year's first quarter. The earnings decline reflected lower electric and natural gas sales volumes, which were primarily due to milder winter temperatures. This milder temperatures lowered earnings by an estimated $0.10 per share compared to 2015. The year-over-year earnings comparison was also reduced as a result of lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. In January 2016, Noranda announced that production had been idle at 2 of its 3 smelter pipelines as a result of an operational failure. And in mid-March, Noranda idled its remaining smelter pipeline. The impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by a decrease in the effective income tax rate, which was primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased earnings from FERC regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery service, resulting from infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. Overall, our first quarter results were solid and we remain on track to deliver within our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
Turning now to page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continued to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. This include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we invested more than $300 million of our first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our first quarter 2016 investments and included approximately $170 million of capital spent on FERC regulated projects. The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this projects 9 line segments is now complete with construction of 3 other segments in 2 of 3 river crossings expected to be completed later this year. Further, 2 of the project's 10 substations are already in service with construction well underway on the remaining ones. For ATXI Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we're currently acquiring right-of-way and plan to begin lane construction later this year. In addition, the project's new substation is under construction and should be completed by the end of the year. 
Finally, I am pleased to note that the Missouri Public Service Commission approved the certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain project late last month. Moving forward, we plan to obtain, from the 5 counties that Mark Twain will cross and to begin right-of-way acquisition soon. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO approved multi value projects. When completed, these projects will deliver significant customer benefits including improved reliability and access to cleaner generation including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. 
Turning to page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $145 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and advanced metering goals. Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades. Since the program began in 2012, installation of storm resilient utility poles, advanced meters, outage detection technology and stronger power lines has resulted in 17% improvement in reliability. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 18% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule. In 2016, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy at least 140,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters at customer's locations in central and southern Illinois. Also, from the beginning of 2012 through 2015, Ameren Illinois added more than 400 employees and more than 1,100 contractor personnel in support of electric system projects under this Modernization Action Plan. These benefits are being driven by the forward thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois. 
Turning now to Missouri were modernizing the regulatory framework has been a key area of focus. As we speak today, House Bill 2689, 21st Century Grid Modernization and Security Act remains on the Missouri senate calendar and is available for further debate. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support including that from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, reserved farm bureau and many other key stakeholders. In addition, this process has resulted in significant and constructive dialogue with policymakers regarding the extent which regulatory lag discourages investment in grid monetization. Unfortunately, the bill is subject to a filibuster by a small group of state senators during debate last week and was not advanced at that time. Time is short for passers of this legislation as this year's general assembly session ends Friday. As a result, I do not believe the comprehensive performance-based ratemaking legislation will be enacted this session. However, despite the short window, we continue to work with key stakeholders to find other constructive pass forward this session. In addition, we will remain focused on enhancing energy policies to address regulatory lag and support investment in Asian infrastructure to both the regulatory and legislative processes. As a result, and at this time, I do expect that we would support another legislative initiative next year. I am convinced that those efforts are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri as we seek to modernize the grid to meet our customer's future energy needs and expectations, as well as create jobs. As long as Missouri stand still is being left behind by other states who've adopted forward thinking energy policies. In light of the fact that we do not expect comprehensive regulatory reform this session, coupled with the ongoing financial impacts of Noranda's outage, as well as increased investments and operating costs, we are moving forward with plans to file for an electric rate increase in early July. 
Moving from regulatory and legislative matters to a quick comment on Missouri operational matters. Our scheduled 2016 nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway energy center was successfully executed and the plant is now back online. We also continue our efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. 
Moving on to page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to roll rate base in an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to bit of the customers and shareholders. Our peer leading rate base growth reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate in a constructive and modern regulatory frameworks. In addition, we stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect in 2016 earnings of lower sales in Noranda. Our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. We also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize it's important to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated utility peers. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we are relentlessly executing our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year-ago period. Key drivers",1541,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year-ago period. Key drivers of the earnings variance are listed on this page. Lower electric and natural gas sales volumes reduced earnings with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.10 per share decline. This temperature related earnings decline was almost entirely driven by lower electric sales volumes since Illinois gas sales are subject to a volume balancing adjustment effective at the beginning of this year. This volume balancing adjustment ensures that changes in natural gas sales including those from weather do not result in an over or under collection of revenues from residential and small nonresidential customers. First quarter 2016 temperatures were not only milder than those experienced in the year-ago period, they were also milder than normal with heating degree days about 20% less than the year ago period and about 10% less than normal. The remainder of the sales volume related earnings decline was almost entirely due to the idling of Noranda's smelter pipelines. Further, the carryover effect from Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Moving to the next key driver of the first quarter earnings variance, last year's Ameren Illinois results benefited from recovery of certain cumulative power usage costs. The absence of this benefit had a $0.04 per share unfavorable effect on the earnings comparison. Shifting now to factors that have a favorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. A decrease in the effective income tax rate lifted earnings by $0.08 per share. This reduced tax rate was primarily due to recognition of 2016 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. These benefits were recognized in earnings pursuant to accounting guidance issued in March of 2016. I would note that the level of such tax benefits to be recognized in future years will be a function of the fair value of share-based incentive awards when they vest and could cause our effective income tax rate to fluctuate above or below the approximately 38% effective tax rate normally expected. For 2016, we now project the full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. In addition, increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.05 per share compared to the year-ago period. I want to note that our ATXI and Ameren Illinois transmission earnings continue to be reduced by reserve reflecting the potential for a lower MISO-based allowed ROE, given pending complaint cases at the FERC. In addition, the earnings of our Illinois electric delivery business incorporated an 8.7% allowed ROE under formulaic rate making compared to 8.6% for the year-ago period. The Illinois electric delivery ROE reflected in the first quarter 2016 results assumes an annual average 30 year treasury yield of 2.9% for the full year. 
Moving to the last item on the page. Earnings for the first quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas delivery service rates effective at the beginning of this year, adding $0.04 per share. Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for the first quarter. Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt hours sales to Illinois' industrial customers decreased approximately 8%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers including those in mining, agriculture, auto and steel making. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri's industrial customers were flat. 
Turning to page 10 of our presentation. Now, I would like to discuss our guidance for this year. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share despite several notable items that were not incorporated into our initial guidance provided back in February. These include 1 favorable item that was offset by 3 unfavorable items resulting in no change to our guidance range. The favorable item was the decrease in the first quarter effective income tax rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation which boosted earnings by $0.08 per share. The 3 unfavorable items were, milder first quarter temperatures which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.05 per share compared to normal temperatures, an increase in the 2016 estimated earnings impact from lower sales to Noranda of $0.02 per share, as well as a 30 basis point lower assumed ROE for Illinois electric delivery service, which reduced expected 2016 EPS by almost $0.02 per share. The last item reflected the lower estimated average 30 year treasury rate for 2016 of 2.9% which I mentioned a moment ago compared to our beginning of the year estimate of 3.2%. Regarding Noranda, our 2016 guidance includes an updated estimate of approximately $0.15 per share for the impact of lower electric sales to this customer compared to the prior estimate of $0.13 per share. As we discussed in February, this estimate is net of expected revenues from off system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under a provision of our fuel adjustment clause. This estimate has been updated for the regulatory agreed-upon method for calculating such off system sales revenues and changes in foreign power prices. We continue to assume Noranda's production lines will remain idle for the rest of this year. 
I will not go through the balance of the year earnings consideration listed on this page since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed each item on our February earnings call. Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROE's in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, this goal will continue to be more challenging to achieve in Missouri, pending improvement in the regulatory framework, however, as Warner mentioned, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case in early July to recover costs related to additional infrastructure investments and rising expenses including those related to net fuel, depreciation, transmission service and property taxes. In addition, rates need to be adjusted to reflect the loss of sales to Noranda. As discussed in February, we expect the earnings impact of lower sales to Noranda to be temporary. 
Moving now to page 11. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois  commerce commission and the federal energy regulatory commission. Turning first to Illinois. Last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of servings and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing seeks a $14 million decrease in annual electric rates. This net amount includes a $96 million increase reflecting 2015 actual costs, related carrying charges and expected 2016 infrastructure investments, which is more than offset by a $110 million decrease due to recovery by year-end 2016 of previously under recovered 2014 costs and related carrying charges. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base. The formula determined allowed ROE which is the annual average of 30 year U.S. Treasury bond yields for that year, plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners including Ameren Illinois and ATXI are pending at the FERC. In the first case, the scheduled calls for a final order from the FERC in the fourth -- excuse me, in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the second case, the scheduled calls for an initial order from an administrative law judge by the end of June this year with a final order from the FERC expected next year. 
Finally, turning to page 12. I will summarize. We have affirmed our earnings guidance for 2016 and we continue to execute our strategy. Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. When you compile -- combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which now provides investors with an above peer group average yield of approximately 3.5%, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors. That concludes our prepared remarks. we now invite your questions."

But importantly, when we talk about that 5% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth, we were basing that off of an adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63. Obviously, if you took our guidance for this year, the midpoint's $2.50, but we added to that the impact we estimated at that time of the Noranda outage, which was $0.13 at that time to get to an adjusted midpoint of $2.63 and then, base the earnings guidance off of that. And the reason we did that is that we do believe the impact of Noranda's outage on our earnings to be temporary and as we mentioned on the call, we do expect to file a Missouri rate case in early July of this year. We expect that, that rate case will reflect the reduced usage by Noranda and as our rates are adjusted next year, then the temporary impact of this earnings decline from the outage would be erased. So that's how we expect it to go and long term, in terms of our earnings growth guidance, Noranda may be there, Noranda may not be there. We're not speculating on that but we do believe that through the rate case process, the impact of the outage will be negated."

And as mentioned on the call, what it really be a function of is what the fair value of long-term share-based compensation as of the time of vest versus what's been reflected in book expense over the 3 years as it relates to our plans over the three-year vesting period. And that can create a little bit of volatility in effective rate in this particular period, as you see, the value of what vested was greater than what had been recognized in expense over the past 3 years and therefore, the tax benefit was greater than the effective tax rate reflected over the past few years. So we ended up with a benefit this year. But as noted on the talking points, it could be a benefit or it could be a detriment, but I think in the absence of any further information, I think I'd expect that 38% effective tax rate. As it relates to this year, that item had a discrete impact on the first quarter, so lower the first quarter effective tax rate. At the end of the year, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the tax rate -- effective tax rate to be around 35% which would imply over the remainder of this year -- in the remaining 3 quarters that effective tax rate is somewhere between 37% and 38%."

And so Illinois will continue to have specific metrics that they have to hit as part of the grid modernization act and they'll continue to pursue that. As part of the legislative effort in Missouri, there are specific performance metrics that are put out there as well for reliability and that was in the legislation. I think importantly, what really we were focused on and continue to be focused on in Missouri is to address the aging infrastructure. So what are the kind of things we would think about doing well? We would certainly, be doing many of the things which you're seeing over in Illinois, investing in smart meters. Missouri needs to do that and it's an opportunity not just for our customers ultimately to bail the used to more advanced meters. It's investing on smarter grid, whether it be on the power lines, whether it be in automating much of the grid compared to where it is today. Substations, all these things are very important and things that we're doing in Illinois that we would be focused on doing in Missouri. Also as part of the legislative effort, we'll be looking at the generation portfolio. Clearly, aging infrastructure, Ameren can do improvements in a more timely fashion with quick generating power plants, as well as invest in renewable energy which was a significant aspect of this bill. So you put all of those things together, these are things that we would be focused on in Missouri should we get legislation passed that would support that, investment and those are the kinds of things were going to talk about what policymakers -- both the remaining part of this session as well as frankly moving into next year, both during the rate case as well as preparing for the next legislative session."

We have had that lag from transmissions since the last rate case and we've been working hard to do what we can to find cost reductions in other areas. I mentioned in the guidance earlier this year that year-over-year as we move from '15 to '16 that we expect overall our operations and maintenance expenses to be down in Missouri and when you normalized for the Callaway refueling and remove the effect of Noranda, expect to earn within 50 basis points of the allowed this year.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in last year's first quarter. The earnings decline reflected lower electric and natural gas sales volumes, which were primarily due to milder winter temperatures. These milder temperatures lowered earnings by an estimated $0.10 per share compared to 2015. 
The year-over-year earnings comparison was also reduced as a result of lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. In early January 2016, Noranda announced that production had been idle at 2 of its 3 smelter pipelines as a result of an operational failure. And in mid-March, Noranda idled its remaining smelter pot line. 
The impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by a decrease in the effective income tax rate, which was primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased earnings from FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery service, resulting from infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. 
Overall, our first quarter results were solid, and we remain on track to deliver within our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. 
I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. 
These include our continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we invested more than $300 million of our first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our first quarter 2016 investments and included approximately $170 million of capital spent on FERC-regulated projects. 
The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this project's 9-line segments is now complete, with construction of 3 other segments in 2 of 3 river crossings expected to be completed later this year. Further, 2 of the project's 10 substations are already in service, with construction well underway on the remaining ones. For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are currently acquiring right of way and plan to begin line construction later this year. In addition, the project's new substation is under construction and should be completed by the end of the year. 
Finally, I am pleased to note that the Missouri Public Service Commission approved the certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain project late last month. Moving forward, we plan to obtain assents from the 5 counties that Mark Twain will cross and to begin right-of-way acquisition soon. 
All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO-approved multi-value projects. When completed, these projects will deliver significant customer benefits, including improved reliability and access to cleaner generation, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $145 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These investments are made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and advanced metering goals. 
Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades. Since the program began in 2012, installation of storm-resilient utility poles, advanced meters, outage detection technology and stronger power lines has resulted in 17% improvement in reliability. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 18% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule. In 2016, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy at least 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters at customer locations in central and southern Illinois. 
Also, from the beginning of 2012 through 2015, Ameren Illinois added more than 400 employees and more than 1,100 contractor personnel in support of electric system projects under this Modernization Action Plan. These benefits are being driven by the forward-thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois. 
Turning now to Missouri, where modernizing the regulatory framework has been a key area of focus. As we speak today, House Bill 2689, 21st Century Grid Modernization and Security Act, remains on the Missouri senate calendar and is available for further debate. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including that from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the Missouri farm bureau and many other key stakeholders. In addition, this process has resulted in significant and constructive dialogue with policymakers regarding the extent which regulatory lag discourages investment in grid monetization. 
Unfortunately, the bill is subject to a filibuster by a small group of state senators during debate last week and was not advanced at that time. Time is short for passers of this legislation as this year's general assembly session ends Friday. As a result, I do not believe a comprehensive performance-based ratemaking legislation will be enacted this session. 
However, despite the short window, we continue to work with key stakeholders to find other constructive paths forward this session. In addition, we will remain focused on enhancing energy policies to address regulatory lag and support investment in aging infrastructure through both the regulatory and legislative processes. As a result, and at this time, I do expect that we would support another legislative initiative next year. 
I am convinced that those efforts are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri as we seek to modernize the grid to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations as well as create jobs. As long as Missouri stands still, it is being left behind by other states who have adopted forward-thinking energy policies. In light of the fact that we do not expect comprehensive regulatory reform this session, coupled with the ongoing financial impacts of Noranda's outage, as well as increased investments and operating costs, we are moving forward with plans to file for an electric rate increase in early July. 
Moving from regulatory and legislative matters to a quick comment on Missouri operational matters. Our scheduled 2016 nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center was successfully executed, and the plant is now back online. We also continue our efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. 
Moving on to Page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our peer-leading rate base growth reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks. In addition, we stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. Our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. 
We also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated utility peers. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we are relentlessly executing our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year-ago period. Key driver",1519,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year-ago period. Key drivers of the earnings variance are listed on this page. 
Lower electric and natural gas sales volumes reduced earnings, with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.10 per share decline. This temperature-related earnings decline was almost entirely driven by lower electric sales volumes since Illinois gas sales are subject to a volume-balancing adjustment effective at the beginning of this year. This volume-balancing adjustment ensures that changes in natural gas sales, including those from weather, do not result in an over- or under-collection of revenues from residential and small nonresidential customers. 
First quarter 2016 temperatures were not only milder than those experienced in the year-ago period, they were also milder than normal, with heating degree days about 20% less than the year-ago period and about 10% less than normal. 
The remainder of the sales volume-related earnings decline was almost entirely due to the idling of Noranda's smelter pot lines. Further, the carryover effect from Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Moving to the next key driver of the first quarter earnings variance. Last year's Ameren Illinois results benefited from recovery of certain cumulative power usage costs. The absence of this benefit had a $0.04 per share unfavorable effect on the earnings comparison. 
Shifting now to factors that had a favorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. A decrease in the effective income tax rate lifted earnings by $0.08 per share. This reduced tax rate was primarily due to recognition of 2016 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. These benefits were recognized in earnings pursuant to accounting guidance issued in March of 2016. 
I would note that the level of such tax benefit to be recognized in future years will be a function of the fair value of share-based incentive awards when they vest and could cause our effective income tax rate to fluctuate above or below the approximately 38% effective tax rate normally expected. For 2016, we now project the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
In addition, increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.05 per share compared to the year-ago period. I want to note that our ATXI and Ameren Illinois transmission earnings continue to be reduced by reserve, reflecting the potential for a lower MISO-based allowed ROE, given pending complaint cases at the FERC. In addition, the earnings of our Illinois electric delivery business incorporated an 8.7% allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking compared to 8.6% for the year-ago period. The Illinois electric delivery ROE reflected in first quarter 2016 results assumes an annual average 30-year treasury yield of 2.9% for the full year. 
Moving to the last item on the page. Earnings for the first quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas delivery service rates effective at the beginning of this year, adding $0.04 per share. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for the first quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois' industrial customers decreased approximately 8%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in mining, agriculture, auto and steelmaking. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri's industrial customers were flat. 
Turning to Page 10 of our presentation. Now I would like to discuss our guidance for this year. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share despite several notable items that were not incorporated into our initial guidance provided back in February. These include 1 favorable item that was offset by 3 unfavorable items, resulting in no change to our guidance range. 
The favorable item was the decrease in the first quarter effective income tax rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which boosted earnings by $0.08 per share. The 3 unfavorable items were: milder first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.05 per share compared to normal temperatures; an increase on the 2016 estimated earnings impact from lower sales to Noranda of $0.02 per share; as well as a 30 basis point lower assumed ROE for Illinois electric delivery service, which reduced expected 2016 EPS by almost $0.02 per share. The last item reflected the lower estimated average 30-year treasury rate for 2016 of 2.9%, which I mentioned a moment ago, compared to our beginning-of-the-year estimate of 3.2%. 
Regarding Noranda, our 2016 guidance includes an updated estimate of approximately $0.15 per share for the impact of lower electric sales to this customer compared to the prior estimate of $0.13 per share. As we discussed in February, this estimate is net of expected revenues from off-system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under the provision of our fuel adjustment clause. This estimate has been updated for the regulatorily agreed-upon method for calculating such off-system sales revenues and changes in forward power prices. We continue to assume Noranda's production lines will remain idle for the rest of this year. I will not go through the balance of the year earnings considerations listed on this page since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed each item on our February earnings call. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, this goal will continue to be more challenging to achieve in Missouri, pending improvement in the regulatory framework. However, as Warner mentioned, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case in early July to recover costs related to additional infrastructure investments and rising expenses, including those related to net fuel, depreciation, transmission service and property taxes. In addition, rates need to be adjusted to reflect the loss of sales to Noranda. As discussed in February, we expect the earnings impact of lower sales to Noranda to be temporary. 
Moving now to Page 11. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois  Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Turning first to Illinois. Last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over- or under-recovery of such costs. 
Our filing seeks a $14 million decrease in annual electric rates. This net amount includes a $96 million increase reflecting 2015 actual costs, related carrying charges and expected 2016 infrastructure investments, which is more than offset by a $110 million decrease due to recovery by year-end 2016 of previously under-recovered 2014 costs and related carrying charges. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead, with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula-determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points and the ICC-authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. In the first case, the schedule calls for a final order from the FERC in the forced -- excuse me, in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the second case, the schedule calls for an initial order from an administrative law judge by the end of June this year with a final order from the FERC expected next year. 
Finally, turning to Page 12. I will summarize. We have affirmed our earnings guidance for 2016, and we continue to execute our strategy. Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. When you compile -- combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which now provides investors with an above-peer-group average yield of approximately 3.5%, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

And the foundational element of that, of course, is the 6.5% rate base growth that we have, which we showed, from 2015 to 2020. But importantly, when we talked about that 5% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth, we were basing that off of an adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63. Obviously, if you took our guidance for this year, the midpoint is $2.50, but we added to that the impact we estimated at that time of the Noranda outage, which was $0.13 at that time, to get to an adjusted midpoint of $2.63 and then based the earnings guidance off of that. And the reason we did that is that we do believe the impact of Noranda's outage on our earnings to be temporary, and as we mentioned on the call, we do expect to file a Missouri rate case in early July of this year. We expect that, that rate case will reflect the reduced usage by Noranda, and as our rates are adjusted next year, then the temporary impact of this earnings decline from the outage would be erased. So that's how we expect it to go. And so long term, in terms of our earnings growth guidance, Noranda may be there, Noranda may not be there. We're not speculating on that, but we do believe that, through the rate case process, the impact of the outage will be mitigated."

And I think going forward, continuing to think about that 38% effective tax rate is probably the right way to think about it, but to be aware that there could be some variation up or down from year-to-year based upon this new accounting guidance. And as mentioned on the call, what it would really be a function of is what the fair value is of long-term share-based compensation as of the time of vest versus what's been reflected in book expense over the 3 years -- as it relates to our plans, over the 3-year vesting period. And that can create a little bit of volatility in the effective rate. In this particular period, as you see, the value of what vested was greater than what had been recognized in expense over the past 3 years, and therefore, the tax benefit was greater than the effective tax rate reflected over the past few years. So we ended up with a benefit this year. But as noted on the talking points, it could be a benefit or it could be a detriment. But I think in the absence of any further information, I think I'd expect that 38% effective tax rate. As it relates to this year, that item had a discrete impact on the first quarter, so it lowered the first quarter effective tax rate. At the end of the year, as we mentioned on the -- in the prepared remarks, we expect the tax rate -- effective tax rate to be around 35%, which would imply, over the remainder of this year -- in the remaining 3 quarters, that effective tax rate is somewhere between 37% and 38%."

Paul (sic) [Julien], this is Warner. I think a couple of things. Number one, by and large, Illinois has clearly made progress in improving reliability as well as responding to outage duration as a result of the grid modernization project. By and large, what you're seeing between the 2 jurisdictions is that they're moving closer in terms of what their overall reliability and ultimate responsiveness to outages are. And so Illinois will continue to have specific metrics that they have to hit as part of the grid modernization act, and they'll continue to pursue that. As part of the legislative effort in Missouri, there are specific performance metrics that are put out there as well for reliability, and that was in the legislation. I think, importantly, what really we were focused on and continue to be focused on in Missouri is to address the aging infrastructure. So what are the kind of things that we would think about doing? Well, we would certainly be doing many of the things that you're seeing over in Illinois, investing in smart meters. Missouri needs to do that, and it's an opportunity not just for our customers ultimately to avail -- to use the more advanced meters. It's investing on a smarter grid. Whether it be on the power lines, whether it be in automating much of the grid compared to where it is today, substations, all these things are very important and things that we're doing in Illinois that we would be focused on doing in Missouri. We would also -- as part of the legislative effort, we'd be looking at the generation portfolio. Clearly, we have aging infrastructure there, and we could do improvements in a more timely fashion, we think, in our generating power plants as well as invest in renewable energy, which was a significant aspect of this bill. So when you put all those things together, these are things that we would be focused on in Missouri should we get legislation passed that would support that investment, and those are the kind of things we're going to continue to talk about with policymakers, both the remaining part of this session as well as, frankly, moving into next year, both during the rate case as well as preparing for the next legislative session."

We have had that lag from transmissions since the last rate case, and we've been working hard to do what we can to find cost reductions in other areas.

The earnings decline reflected lower electric an",1404,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in last year's first quarter. The earnings decline reflected lower electric and natural gas sales volumes, which were primarily due to milder winter temperatures. These milder temperatures lowered earnings by an estimated $0.10 per share compared to 2015. 
The year-over-year earnings comparison was also reduced as a result of lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. In early January 2016, Noranda announced that production had been idled at 2 of its 3 smelter pipelines as a result of an operational failure. And in mid-March, Noranda idled its remaining smelter pot line. 
The impact of these unfavorable items was partially offset by a decrease in the effective income tax rate, which was primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased earnings from FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas delivery service, resulting from infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. 
Overall, our first quarter results were solid, and we remain on track to deliver within our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
Turning now to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continue to strongly believe it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. 
I would like to highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. 
These include our continued strategic allocations of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we invested more than $300 million of our first quarter capital expenditures in jurisdictions with the support of regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our first quarter 2016 investments and included approximately $170 million of capital spent on FERC-regulated projects. 
The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this project's 9-line segments is now complete, with construction of 3 other segments in 2 of 3 river crossings expected to be completed later this year. Further, 2 of the project's 10 substations are already in service, with construction well underway on the remaining ones. For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are currently acquiring right of way and plan to begin line construction later this year. In addition, the project's new substation is under construction and should be completed by the end of the year. 
Finally, I am pleased to note that the Missouri Public Service Commission approved the certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain project late last month. Moving forward, we plan to obtain consents from the 5 counties that Mark Twain will cross and to begin right-of-way acquisition soon. 
All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain are MISO-approved multi-value projects. When completed, these projects will deliver significant customer benefits, including improved reliability and access to cleaner generation, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation. Let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $145 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first quarter of this year. These investments are made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and advanced metering goals. 
Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades. Since the program began in 2012, installation of storm-resilient utility poles, advanced meters, outage detection technology and stronger power lines has resulted in 17% improvement in reliability. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 18% faster on average than in previous years. Further, installations of advanced electric meters are ahead of schedule. In 2016, Ameren Illinois plans to deploy at least 148,000 electric and 103,000 gas meters at customer locations in central and southern Illinois. 
Also, from the beginning of 2012 through 2015, Ameren Illinois added more than 400 employees and more than 1,100 contractor personnel in support of electric system projects under this Modernization Action Plan. These benefits are being driven by the forward-thinking and constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in Illinois. 
Turning now to Missouri, where modernizing the regulatory framework has been a key area of focus. As we speak today, House Bill 2689, 21st Century Grid Modernization and Security Act, remains on the Missouri senate calendar and is available for further debate. Informed by extensive outreach, collaboration and input from key stakeholders, this legislation has received unprecedented statewide support, including that from major chambers of commerce, individual businesses, labor, suppliers, the Missouri farm bureau and many other key stakeholders. In addition, this process has resulted in significant and constructive dialogue with policymakers regarding the extent to which regulatory lag discourages investment in grid modernization. 
Unfortunately, the bill is subject to a filibuster by a small group of state senators during debate last week and was not advanced at that time. Time is short for passage of this legislation as this year's general assembly session ends Friday. As a result, I do not believe a comprehensive performance-based ratemaking legislation will be enacted this session. 
However, despite the short window, we continue to work with key stakeholders to find other constructive paths forward this session. In addition, we will remain focused on enhancing energy policies to address regulatory lag and support investment in aging infrastructure through both the regulatory and legislative processes. As a result, and at this time, I do expect that we would support another legislative initiative next year. 
I am convinced that those efforts are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri as we seek to modernize the grid to meet our customers' future energy needs and expectations as well as create jobs. As long as Missouri stands still, it is being left behind by other states who have adopted forward-thinking energy policies. In light of the fact that we do not expect comprehensive regulatory reform this session, coupled with the ongoing financial impacts of Noranda's outage, as well as increased investments and operating costs, we are moving forward with plans to file for an electric rate increase in early July. 
Moving from regulatory and legislative matters to a quick comment on Missouri operational matters. Our scheduled 2016 nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center was successfully executed, and the plant is now back online. We also continue our efforts to relentlessly improve operating performance, including our focus on safety, disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. 
Moving on to Page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our peer-leading rate base growth reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks. In addition, we stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. Our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. 
We also remain focused on our dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated utility peers. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. To summarize, we are relentlessly executing our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that continuing to do so will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year-ago period. Key driver",1523,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. As Warner already noted, we reported earnings of $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $0.45 per share for the year-ago period. Key drivers of the earnings variance are listed on this page. 
Lower electric and natural gas sales volumes reduced earnings, with milder winter temperatures accounting for an estimated $0.10 per share decline. This temperature-related earnings decline was almost entirely driven by lower electric sales volumes since Illinois gas sales are subject to a volume-balancing adjustment effective at the beginning of this year. This volume-balancing adjustment ensures that changes in natural gas sales, including those from weather, do not result in an over- or under-collection of revenues from residential and small nonresidential customers. 
First quarter 2016 temperatures were not only milder than those experienced in the year-ago period, they were also milder than normal, with heating degree days about 20% less than the year-ago period and about 10% less than normal. 
The remainder of the sales volume-related earnings decline was almost entirely due to the idling of Noranda's smelter pot lines. Further, the carryover effect from Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Moving to the next key driver of the first quarter earnings variance. Last year's Ameren Illinois results benefited from recovery of certain cumulative power usage costs. The absence of this benefit had a $0.04 per share unfavorable effect on the earnings comparison. 
Shifting now to factors that had a favorable effect on the first quarter earnings comparison. A decrease in the effective income tax rate lifted earnings by $0.08 per share. This reduced tax rate was primarily due to recognition of 2016 tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. These benefits were recognized in earnings pursuant to accounting guidance issued in March of 2016. 
I would note that the level of such tax benefit to be recognized in future years will be a function of the fair value of share-based incentive awards when they vest and could cause our effective income tax rate to fluctuate above or below the approximately 38% effective tax rate normally expected. For 2016, we now project the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
In addition, increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.05 per share compared to the year-ago period. I want to note that our ATXI and Ameren Illinois transmission earnings continue to be reduced by a reserve, reflecting the potential for a lower MISO-based allowed ROE, given pending complaint cases at the FERC. In addition, the earnings of our Illinois electric delivery business incorporated an 8.7% allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking compared to 8.6% for the year-ago period. The Illinois electric delivery ROE reflected in first quarter 2016 results assumes an annual average 30-year treasury yield of 2.9% for the full year. 
Moving to the last item on the page. Earnings for the first quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas delivery service rates effective at the beginning of this year, adding $0.04 per share. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends for the first quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois' industrial customers decreased approximately 8%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in mining, agriculture, auto and steelmaking. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri's industrial customers were flat. 
Turning to Page 10 of our presentation. Now I would like to discuss our guidance for this year. As Warner stated, we continue to expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share despite several notable items that were not incorporated into our initial guidance provided back in February. These include 1 favorable item that was offset by 3 unfavorable items, resulting in no change to our guidance range. 
The favorable item was the decrease in the first quarter effective income tax rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which boosted earnings by $0.08 per share. The 3 unfavorable items were: milder first quarter temperatures, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.05 per share compared to normal temperatures; an increase in the 2016 estimated earnings impact from lower sales to Noranda of $0.02 per share; as well as a 30 basis point lower assumed ROE for Illinois electric delivery service, which reduced expected 2016 EPS by almost $0.02 per share. The last item reflected the lower estimated average 30-year treasury rate for 2016 of 2.9%, which I mentioned a moment ago, compared to our beginning of the year estimate of 3.2%. 
Regarding Noranda, our 2016 guidance includes an updated estimate of approximately $0.15 per share for the impact of lower electric sales to this customer compared to the prior estimate of $0.13 per share. As we discussed in February, this estimate is net of expected revenues from off-system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under a provision of our fuel adjustment clause. This estimate has been updated for the regulatorily agreed-upon method for calculating such off-system sales revenues and changes in forward power prices. We continue to assume Noranda's production lines will remain idle for the rest of this year. I will not go through the balance of the year earnings considerations listed on this page since they are largely self-explanatory and we discussed each item on our February earnings call. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, this goal will continue to be more challenging to achieve in Missouri, pending improvement in the regulatory framework. However, as Warner mentioned, we expect to file a Missouri electric rate case in early July to recover costs related to additional infrastructure investments and rising expenses, including those related to net fuel, depreciation, transmission service and property taxes. In addition, rates need to be adjusted to reflect the loss of sales to Noranda. As discussed in February, we expect the earnings impact of lower sales to Noranda to be temporary. 
Moving now to Page 11. I would like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois  Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Turning first to Illinois. Last month, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric delivery rate update filing. Under Illinois' formula ratemaking, our utility is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over- or under-recovery of such costs. 
Our filing seeks a $14 million decrease in annual electric rates. This net amount includes a $96 million increase reflecting 2015 actual costs, related carrying charges and expected 2016 infrastructure investments, which is more than offset by a $110 million decrease due to recovery by year-end 2016 of previously under-recovered 2014 costs and related carrying charges. The ICC will review the matter in the months ahead, with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective early next year. I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric delivery earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base, the formula-determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points and the ICC-authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Finally, previously mentioned complaint cases seeking to reduce base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, are pending at the FERC. In the first case, the schedule calls for a final order from the FERC in the forced -- excuse me, in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the second case, the schedule calls for an initial order from an administrative law judge by the end of June this year with a final order from the FERC expected next year. 
Finally, turning to Page 12. I will summarize. We have affirmed our earnings guidance for 2016, and we continue to execute our strategy. Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. When you compile -- combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which now provides investors with an above-peer-group average yield of approximately 3.5%, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.

You may recall when we gave the long-term guidance outlook back in February, we -- number one, said we expected 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth from 2016 through 2020. And the foundational element of that, of course, is the 6.5% rate base growth that we have, which we showed from 2015 to 2020. But importantly, when we talked about that 5% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth, we were basing that off of an adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63. Obviously, if you took our guidance for this year, the midpoint is $2.50, but we added to that the impact we estimated at that time of the Noranda outage, which was $0.13 at that time, to get to an adjusted midpoint of $2.63 and then based the earnings guidance off of that. And the reason we did that is that we do believe the impact of Noranda's outage on our earnings to be temporary, and as we mentioned on the call, we do expect to file a Missouri rate case in early July of this year. We expect that, that rate case will reflect the reduced usage by Noranda, and as our rates are adjusted next year, then the temporary impact of this earnings decline from the outage would be erased. So that's how we expect it to go. And so long term, in terms of our earnings growth guidance, Noranda may be there, Noranda may not be there. We're not speculating on that, but we do believe that through the rate case process, the impact of the outage will be mitigated"

And I think going forward, continuing to think about that 38% effective tax rate is probably the right way to think about it, but to be aware that there could be some variation up or down from year-to-year based upon this new accounting guidance. And as mentioned on the call, what it would really be a function of is what the fair value is of long-term share-based compensation is at the time it vests versus what's been reflected in book expense over the 3 years -- as it relates to our plans, over the 3-year vesting period. And that can create a little bit of volatility in the effective rate. In this particular period, as you see, the value of what vested was greater than what had been recognized in expense over the past 3 years, and therefore, the tax benefit was greater than the effective tax rate reflected over the past few years. So we ended up with a benefit this year. But as noted on the talking points, it could be a benefit or it could be a detriment. But I think in the absence of any further information, I think I'd expect that 38% effective tax rate. As it relates to this year, that item had a discrete impact on the first quarter, so it lowered the first quarter effective tax rate. At the end of the year, as we mentioned on the -- in the prepared remarks, we expect the tax rate -- effective tax rate to be around 35%, which would imply, over the remainder of this year -- in the remaining 3 quarters, that effective tax rate is somewhere between 37% and 38%."

Paul (sic) [Julien], this is Warner. I think a couple of things. Number one, by and large, Illinois has clearly made progress in improving reliability as well as responding to outage duration as a result of the grid modernization project. By and large, what you're seeing between the 2 jurisdictions is that they're moving closer in terms of what their overall reliability and ultimate responsiveness to outages are. And so Illinois will continue to have specific metrics that they have to hit as part of the grid modernization act, and they'll continue to pursue that. As part of the legislative effort in Missouri, there are specific performance metrics that are put out there as well for reliability, and that was in the legislation. I think, importantly, what really we were focused on and continue to be focused on in Missouri is to address the aging infrastructure. So what are the kind of things that we would think about doing? Well, we would certainly be doing many of the things that you're seeing over in Illinois, investing in smart meters. Missouri needs to do that, and it's an opportunity not just for our customers ultimately to be able to use the more advanced meters. It's investing on a smarter grid. Whether it be on the power lines, whether it be in automating much of the grid compared to where it is today, substations, all these things are very important and things that we're doing in Illinois that we would be focused on doing in Missouri. We would also -- as part of the legislative effort, we'd be looking at the generation portfolio. Clearly, we have aging infrastructure there, and we could do improvements in a more timely fashion, we think, in our generating power plants as well as invest in renewable energy, which was a significant aspect of this bill. So when you put all those things together, these are things that we would be focused on in Missouri should we get legislation passed that would support that investment, and those are the kind of things we're going to continue to talk about with policymakers, both the remaining part of this session as well as, frankly, moving into next year, both during the rate case as well as preparing for the next legislative session."

I'd remind you, Ashar, that overall, we continue to work very hard to earn as close to our allowed return as we can. We have had that lag from transmissions since the last rate case, and we've been working hard to do what we can to find cost reductions in other areas. I mentioned in the guidance earlier this year that year-over-year, as we move from '15 to '16, that we expect overall our operations and maintenance expenses to be down in Missouri and when you normalize for the Callaway refueling and remove the effect of Noranda, expect to earn within 50 basis points of the allowed this year. So in isolation, absolutely yes, that transmission -- the increases in transmission costs are creating lag for us."

This earnings increase reflected hig",1539,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Today, we announced second quarter 2016 core earnings of $0.61 per share compared to core earnings of $0.58 per share in last year's second quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales of Noranda Aluminum, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC regulated transmission and Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks to better serve our customers. 
These favorable items were partially offset by expenses for the 2016 scheduled Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage as well as lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. 
Earlier this year, Noranda idle production had a smelter and the plant remains shut down. Overall, our second quarter results were solid as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy, and I am pleased to report that we have raised our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.45 to $2.625 per share, up from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 reflecting year-to-date results. 
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continued strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. 
I would like to take a moment and highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. 
To begin, our accomplishments include continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks to provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in a graphic on the right side of the slide. 
As you can see, year-to-date, we invested almost $650 million of capital in jurisdictions with fee support of regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 investments and included approximately $330 million of capital spent on FERC regulated transmission projects. The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois River transmission project. Construction of the first of this project's 9 lin segment is complete. The construction of 3 other segments and 2 of 3 River crossings well underway. 
Further, 2 projects, 10 substations are already in service with remaining 8 under construction. 
For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are acquiring the balance of the needed right-of-way and we plan to begin line construction later this year. 
As for the Mark Twain project, we are in the process of obtaining a sense from the 5 counties this transmission line will cross and have began right-of-way acquisition. All 3 of these transmission projects: Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved multi-value projects. When completed, they will deliver significant customer benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from Western and Northern parts of the MISO region. 
We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois  transmission that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $320 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 6 months. These include investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investments, liability and smart meter goals. 
Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages due to our smart grid investments. 
In addition, natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are improving the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system. 
Turning out the Missouri. First, on May 10, we safely completed the 21st nuclear refueling and maintenance outage for our Callaway Energy Center ahead of schedule. 
In addition, Ameren Missouri continues to aggressively manage those costs that are under its control. Our success in this area has helped maintain electric rates that are at the lowest of any investor owned utility in Missouri and are well below the Midwest and national averages. 
While we are taking actions to keep our electric rates among the lowest in the country, we also need to take action to begin recovery of energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates. 
As a result, in early July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission, or PSC, for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue. 
This request includes recovery of and return on the new infrastructure investments I just mentioned, including those from nuclear safety, environmental controls, transmission line improvements and reliability. 
In addition, the filing includes recovery of fixed costs related to the loss of sales to Noranda as well as increased MISO transmission charges. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this proceeding in late April of next year. Marty will discuss this rate filing further in a moment. 
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, comprehensive performance-based rate making legislation was not enacted by Missouri General Assembly before the session ended in mid-May as a result of a [indiscernible] buster by a small group of state senators. 
Since then, 2 separate efforts have been initiative by the state to address the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri energy infrastructure. 
One of these efforts is an undertaking under Missouri PSC and the other is the work of a Senate interim committee. 
Stated purpose of the Missouri PSC's effort is to consider policies to improve the way in which the commission regulates Missouri's investor-owned electric utilities. And the stated objective of the Senate interim committee is to evaluate ways utility regulatory process in Missouri might be modernized in order to ensure sustained investment in utility infrastructure, while at the same time promoting interest of fairness among all constituencies, including customers and shareholders. We are pleased, and we're certainly appreciate that the Missouri PSC and the Senate Interim Committee are taking the time and effort to study this important issue.  I am convinced that improvements to Missouri's regulatory framework are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire State of Missouri as we seek to implement a smarter grid, transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio as well as create jobs. 
We have filed comments with the Missouri PSC, and they will be actively engaged in both proceedings this summer and fall. 
In addition, we continue to engage with other key stakeholders involved in the process to constructive path forward to support investment in Missouri's aging infrastructure. 
As I wrap up my business update, I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have maintained a relentless focus on executing our strategy, which is enabling us to deliver safe, reliable and affordable service our customers and the communities we serve. Their actions have included working under challenging and hot operating conditions in the field and in the energy centers, responding to our customers' needs in timely manner and faced with periodic summer storms, using innovation to meet our customers rising expectations as well as making our operations even more efficient and most importantly, doing all of these things with safety in the top of their mind. 
Of course, we're not done. Looking ahead, we will be relentless in our efforts to improve our operating and financial performance, including maintaining our strong focus on safety as well as exercising discipline cost management and strategic capital allocation, and we will continue to focus on meeting and exceeding our customers energy needs and expectations and ultimately, delivering superior long-term value to you, our shareholders. 
Speaking of delivering superior value to our shareholders, I'll now move to Page 7 in our long-term total return outlook. 
In February, we outlined our plan to go rate base in an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our above peer average rate based growth plan reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern predator frameworks.  Now rate based growth is foundational to our strong energy per share growth expectations. 
We stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. 
We also remain focused on delivering a solid dividend as we recognize its importance to our shareholders.  Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated utility periods. 
Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend results in superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we continue to successfully execute our strategy and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, the",1476,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. 
As you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for this year's second quarter. 
Moving than to Page 10. Here we highlight factors that drove that $0.03 per share increase in second quarter 2016 results compared to prior year quarter results. In 2016, we experienced higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales to Noranda, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. These temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.07 per share versus 2015 and $0.06 per share versus normal conditions. 
Moving to the next key driver of the second quarter earnings variance. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois business lifted earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the year ago period and net of changes in returns on equity. Our Illinois electric distribution business results Incorporated and 8.45% allowed ROE under formulate ratemaking compared to 8.75% for the year ago period based on assumed average of 30-year treasury rate of 2.65% for the full year. 
Moving to the next 2 items on the page. Earnings for the second quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas distribution service rates effective this year as well as the decline in other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers, regulatory trackers or formulary rates, each adding $0.02 per share compared to the prior year period. 
Shifting now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the second quarter earnings comparison. The scheduled 2016 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage reduced second quarter 2016 earnings by $0.07 per share compared to 2015 when there was no refueling outage.  The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of next year. 
The previously mentioned idling of Noranda smelter pipelines reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. And finally, the quarter-over-quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan negatively affected the earnings comparison by $0.04 per share. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date. Overall, we experienced sales trends similar to those discussed on our first quarter call. Weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers in the combined basis were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. 
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 5%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. 
Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down 0.5%. 
Turning to Page 11 of our presentation. Now I would like to move from this discussion of sales to our guidance for the full year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This increased guidance reflects solid year-to-date results, including a first quarter tax gain associated with new accounting rule and an estimated $0.01 per share first half whether benefit compared to normal us warmer-than-normal second quarter temperatures more than offset milder-than-normal first quarter temperatures. 
Regarding Noranda, we continue to expect the unfavorable impact of lower electric sales to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2016. This estimate is net of expected revenues from all system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under our provision of our fuel adjustment cost. We continue to expect Noranda's smelter to remain idle for the rest of this year and that this will reduce earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in the third quarter and approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year periods. 
I will not go through the other earnings considerations listed on this page because they are largely self-explanatory, and we discussed them on our February earnings call. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at/or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, we are falling short of this goal in Missouri in 2016 due in large part to the Noranda sales losses. 
Moving to Page 12. Here, we begin to outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate case, which Warner mentioned earlier. 
Earlier this week, parties to this proceeding jointly proposed the scheduled to the Missouri Public Service Commission in key dates of the proposed schedule I listed on this page. We expect the public service commission to decide the case by late April of next year with new rates expected to be effective in late May. 
Further on Page 13, you can see that 3/4 of our $206 million request is driven by our need to recover and are in a return on an important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales, largely driven by the idling of Noranda smelter and recovery increased MISO transmission charges. To address the regulatory lag associated with these increasing transmission expenses, we've requested the implementation of a new MISO transmission tracker. 
In addition, the rate filing includes $8 million for amortized recovery of an estimated $81 million of fixed costs not recovered as a result of lower sales to Noranda. 
I would also like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Turning to Page 14. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate filing with ICC. Under formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois makes such filings to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost to service and to true-up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement consisting of an increased reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investments that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end of this year. 
Late last month, Ameren Illinois and the ICC staff entered into a stipulation agreement that resolved all issues currently existing between them and supported and annual revenue requirement that is consistent with Ameren Illinois filing. The positions for other interveners in the case are noted on this page and an ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. 
I'll remind you each years Illinois electric distribution earnings are function of that years ending rate base, the formula determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields for that year, plus 580 basis points and the ICC authorized equity ratio and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Turning to Page 15. Here, we outlined the previously mentioned complaint cases pending at the FERC that seeks to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
In the first case last December, FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE and the FERC is expected to issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the second case in late June, the FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 9.7% base allowed ROE with a final FERC decision expected in the second quarter of next year. 
As a result of these pending cases and consistent with the ALJ ruling in each case, we have accrued equity reserve for potential refunds of $58 million as of June 30, 2016. 
Finally turning to Page 16. I will summarize. Year-to-date in 2016, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and we have delivered solid second quarter and year-to-date results. Our solid year-to-date results allowed us to increase our fully earnings guidance range for 2016. 
Further on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. 
When you combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which provides investors with a yield of approximately 3.3% and which is above average compared to fully regulated utility peers, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

So wh",445,"Yes, sure, Julien, this is Marty. Obviously, a number of questions there. I think that as it relates to energy efficiency, you got to keep in mind that some of what we've quantified is, year-over-year comparative impacts from last year to this year. So when we think about that, you got to remember that the constructed energy efficiency plan in Missouri from 2013 through 2015 was different than the one we've got now. And last year, we were being compensated for some of the efforts associated with energy efficiency and being compensated now only for the current year effects in 2015, but some of the carryover effects to 2016. And so that's creating a bit of a year-over-year comparison, and that's why we've noted some of those effects this year. In terms of the sales trends, what we're seeing with mentioned this on the call, year-to-date, on a consolidated basis, residential and commercial sales, were roughly flat. Frankly, they're up a little bit in Missouri and down a little bit in Illinois. Than industrial sales overall are down about 4% with Missouri down about 0.5% and Illinois down more significantly. When you actually exclude the impacts of energy efficiency in Missouri, we would actually see overall sales instead of being flat, overall sales we'd see up about 1.5%. On the residential, we think they'd be up about 1.3%; commercial, may be up 2%; and industrial, while they are down on a reported basis, may be up 0.5% excluding energy efficiency. So we do see those programs as having an effect, both programs we've put in place last year, having a carryover effect to this year but also the current year programs that we've now put into place. So they are having an impact, but overall, sales are about where we thought. We thought they'd be about flattish because of the effects of energy efficiency, and that's about where they are. I think economically, unemployments running pretty good. In Missouri frankly, I think you probably saw nationally, the employment for about 4.9% now for the past couple of months. What we're seeing in Missouri is actually run a little bit below that closer to 4%, while unfortunately on the Illinois side, what we're seeing some of the industrial sales declines seeing unemployment a little bit higher over there, at about 6%. But overall, I think the economies are remaining stable. We're seeing a little bit of growth I'd say in Missouri, especially when you strip out energy efficiency. And now in Illinois, while the industrial sales are down, we're still seeing some growth in terms of residential and commercial demand, which we see as a positive."

I think as you think about the 5% to 8% growth over time as we've said repeatedly, that's really anchored by the 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. And so that is really is the foundation. And then when you think about whether we would be above that or below that from an earnings per share growth perspective, certainly, changes in treasury rates or earned ROEs, sales growth level, spending levels, regulatory decisions, all of those things can push you up or down within that range. And look, it's a 5-year outlook going out to 2020. So a number of things can happen over that time, and that's why we have sort of $0.40 range when you look out to 2020. As it relates to the current impact of the 30-year treasuries as we mentioned on the call, we have booked to a lower treasury yield, and we expected at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, we had expected treasury yields to be around 3.2. What we booked to as of the end of June is an average rate for the year of about 2.65 and of course, the current 30-day treasuries are set at 2.25. So that has caused us to change our outlook for this year. We baked that into our guidance range for this year. I'd remind you that 50 basis point move in ROEs in the Ameren Illinois deliver business, about $0.025. So that gives you a sensitivity, but we've baked that into our current year guidance. We feel very good about the guidance we were able to raise it $0.05, as you know, this year, which is a positive net of the impacts of those changes in 30-year treasuries. And as it relates to our long-term guidance, we, obviously, update our overall thoughts about how we're going to manage the business going forward on an annual basis. But right now, feel very good about that 6.5% rate base growth and that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth that we projected."

Good question and I think if you look back beginning of the year guidance and then walk through our first quarter and now, our second quarter disclosures, you can piece some of these things together and some of those. I think as it relates to starting with our guidance at the beginning of the year and taking about how it moved, we had an $0.08-or-so pick up from the adoption of the new accounting standards in the first quarter, which was a positive. At that same time, we also had a couple of additional cent of decline due to this Noranda outage. We started the year thinking it was going to be about $0.13 impact and now, we're at about $0.15 impact. We also had, as you mentioned, we've now had a little bit of lowered expectation in terms of the treasury rates and again, like you said, that has impacted us by $0.02 or $0.03 there as well. So those are some of the impacts that we had. Now in the first quarter, we also had negative weather, it was about $0.05 negative in the first quarter. As mentioned on the call, we had positive weather here in the second quarter, which more than offset more about $0.01 positive now for weather year-to-date. So when you look at that where we are at the end of 6 months, you get that tax gain that we experienced in the first quarter. You got about $0.01 a positive quarter. We've had some offsets due to the decline in the treasuries and then this temporary impact of the Noranda outage that we're experiencing this year. So those are some of the things that were pluses and minuses versus our original expectations and why we were positioned then with backdrop of very solid operations and very solid execution of our strategy and our plan for this year that we're able to raise the guidance by $0.05."

I'll take a shot at it, and I'll let Michael add some more details on that. Number one, I think I would start with this. There's a positive development that we're talking about the need to address Missouri's aging infrastructure and seeking solutions, especially outside of the legislative session. So I see that these proceedings that are being conducted both by the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Senate [indiscernible] Committee an opportunity for stakeholders really to come together to not only share ideas, to share differences and to try to find a constructive path forward. And so while maybe some of the filings included things that the intervenors or others do not want to see that's informative. Secondly, I know that Ameren, Ameren Missouri and then certainly the utility group, they felt specific suggestions and there was a host of suggestions to try and address this issue. So I fully expected the commission to carefully look at these things, to engage with stakeholders as well as to send an interim committee to try and advance Missouri forward. Because as we've been consistent. We strongly believe that this is not only an opportunity but one of these things that is really impaired Missouri to move forward without constructive policies. And so we're encouraged by this. We look forward to engage with the key stakeholders. Michael, you've been working with some of the more specific key stakeholders. Anything you like o add in terms of the overall process and where things go from here?"

I think that the commission is being very constructive in its process, we'll have a couple more rounds of testimonies as we move through it. As Warner said, the interim Senate committee is going to hold some hearings in the very near future. They're really looking to get some outside perspectives. And I think, to me, the one thing that's really positive in all of this is there's a recognition of the issue. Now there's not a tremendous consensus on what the solution is yet, but there's a recognition of the issue, that's for the whole thing starts. Once we have the identified, we can figure out how to do about it and come through the debate and dialogue come up with the resolution. So I think it's a positive first step, hard to predict where it's going to go but most I think the commission order process as well as interim Senate committee are driving towards an early December date with ample time to work something through the legislative process."

Today, we announced second quarter 2016 core earnings of $0.61 per share compared to core earnings of $0.58 per share in last year's second quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales of Noranda Aluminum, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks to better serve our customers. 
These favorable items were partially offset by expenses for the 2016 scheduled Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage as well as lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. 
Earlier this year, Noranda idled production at a smelter, and the plant remains shut down. Overall, our second quarter results were solid as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy, and I am pleased to report that we have raised our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting year-to-date results. 
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continue to strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. 
I would like to take a moment and highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. To begin, our accomplishments include continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks to provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. 
As you can see, year-to-date, we invested almost $650 million of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 investments and included approximately $330 million of capital spent on FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this project's 9 line segments is complete, with construction of 3 other segments and 2 of 3 river crossings well under way. Further, 2 of the project's 10 substations are already in service with remaining 8 under construction. 
For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are acquiring the balance of the needed right-of-way, and we plan to begin line construction later this year. 
As for the Mark Twain project, we are in the process of obtaining assents from the 5 counties this transmission line will cross and have begun right-of-way acquisition. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved multi-value projects. When completed, they will deliver significant customer benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. 
We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois  transmission that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $320 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 6 months. These include investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and smart meter goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages due to our smart grid investments. 
In addition, natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are improving the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system. 
Turning now to Missouri. First, on May 10, we safely completed the 21st nuclear refueling and maintenance outage for our Callaway Energy Center ahead of schedule. 
In addition, Ameren Missouri continues to aggressively manage those costs that are under its control. Our success in this area has helped maintain electric rates that are the lowest of any investor-owned utility in Missouri and are well below the Midwest and national averages. 
While we are taking actions to keep our electric rates among the lowest in the country, we also need to take action to begin recovery of energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates. As a result, in early July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission, or PSC, for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue. This request includes recovery of, and return on, the new infrastructure investments I just mentioned, including those from nuclear safety, environmental controls, transmission line improvements and reliability. 
In addition, the filing includes recovery of fixed costs related to the loss of sales to Noranda as well as increased MISO transmission charges. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this proceeding in late April of next year. Marty will discuss this rate filing further in a moment. 
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, comprehensive, performance-based ratemaking legislation was not enacted by the Missouri General Assembly before its session ended in mid-May as a result of a filibuster by a small group of state senators. Since then, 2 separate efforts have been initiated by the state to address the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri energy infrastructure. 
One of these efforts is an undertaking under Missouri PSC and the other is the work of a Senate Interim Committee. 
The stated purpose of the Missouri PSC's effort is to consider policies to improve the way in which the commission regulates Missouri's investor-owned electric utilities; and the stated objective of the Senate Interim Committee is to evaluate ways utility regulatory process in Missouri might be modernized in order to ensure sustained investment in utility infrastructure while, at the same time, promoting interest of fairness among all constituencies, including customers and shareholders. We are pleased, and we are -- certainly appreciate that the Missouri PSC and the Senate Interim Committee are taking the time and effort to study this important issue. I am convinced that improvements to Missouri's regulatory framework are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri as we seek to implement a smarter grid, transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio as well as create jobs. 
We have filed comments with the Missouri PSC, and we will be actively engaged in both proceedings this summer and fall. 
In addition, we continue to engage with other key stakeholders involved in the process to explore constructive paths forward to support investment in Missouri's aging infrastructure. 
As I wrap up my business update, I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have maintained their relentless focus on executing our strategy, which is enabling us to deliver safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers and the communities we serve. Their actions have included working under challenging and hot operating conditions in the field and in our energy centers, responding to our customers' needs in a timely manner when faced with periodic summer storms, using innovation to meet our customers' rising expectations as well as making our operations even more efficient, and most importantly, doing all of these things with safety being at the top of their mind. 
Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we will be relentless in our efforts to improve our operating and financial performance, including maintaining our strong focus on safety as well as exercising disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. And we will continue to focus on meeting and exceeding our customers' energy needs and expectations and ultimately delivering superior long-term value to you, our shareholders. 
Speaking of delivering superior value to our shareholders, I will now move to Page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our above-peer-average rate based growth plan reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks, and our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. 
We stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. 
We also remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated-utility peers. 
Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, results in superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there",1477,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for this year's second quarter. 
Moving then to Page 10. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.03 per share increase in second quarter 2016 results compared to prior year quarter results. In 2016, we experienced higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales to Noranda, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. These temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.07 per share versus 2015 and $0.06 per share versus normal conditions. 
Moving to the next key driver of the second quarter earnings variance. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the year-ago period and net of changes in returns on equity. Our Illinois electric distribution business results incorporated an 8.45% allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking compared to 8.75% for the year-ago period based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.65% for the full year. 
Moving to the next 2 items on the page. Earnings for the second quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas distribution service rates effective this year as well as the decline in other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers, regulatory trackers or formula rates, each adding $0.02 per share compared to the prior year period. 
Shifting now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the second quarter earnings comparison. The scheduled 2016 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage reduced second quarter 2016 earnings by $0.07 per share compared to 2015 when there was no refueling outage.  The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of next year. 
The previously mentioned idling of Noranda smelter pipelines reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. And finally, the quarter-over-quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan negatively affected the earnings comparison by $0.04 per share. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date. Overall, we experienced sales trends similar to those discussed on our first quarter call. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. 
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 5%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down 0.5%. 
Turning to Page 11 of our presentation. Now I would like to move from this discussion of sales to our guidance for the full year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This increased guidance reflects solid year-to-date results, including a first quarter tax gain associated with the new accounting rule and an estimated $0.01 per share first half weather benefit compared to normal, as warmer-than-normal second quarter temperatures more than offset milder-than-normal first quarter temperatures. 
Regarding Noranda, we continue to expect the unfavorable impact of lower electric sales to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2016. This estimate is net of expected revenues from all system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under our provision of our fuel adjustment clause. We continue to expect Noranda's smelter to remain idle for the rest of this year and that this will reduce earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in the third quarter and approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year periods. 
I will not go through the other earnings considerations listed on this page because they are largely self-explanatory, and we discussed them on our February earnings call. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, we are falling short of this goal in Missouri in 2016, due in large part to the Noranda sales losses. 
Moving to Page 12. Here, we begin to outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate case, which Warner mentioned earlier. 
Earlier this week, parties to this proceeding jointly proposed a schedule to the Missouri Public Service Commission, and key dates of the proposed schedule are listed on this page. We expect the Public Service Commission to decide the case by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May. 
Further, on Page 13, you can see that 3/4 of our $206 million request is driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers; adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales, largely driven by the idling of Noranda smelter; and recovery of increased MISO transmission charges. To address the regulatory lag associated with these increasing transmission expenses, we have requested the implementation of a new MISO transmission tracker. 
In addition, the rate filing includes $8 million for amortized recovery of an estimated $81 million of fixed costs not recovered as a result of lower sales to Noranda. 
I would also like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Turning to Page 14. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate filing with the ICC. Under formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois makes such filings to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost to service and to true-up any prior-period over- or under-recovery of such costs. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investments that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end of this year. 
Late last month, Ameren Illinois and the ICC staff entered into a stipulation agreement that resolved all issues currently existing between them and supported an annual revenue requirement that is consistent with Ameren Illinois' filing. The positions for other interveners in the case are noted on this page, and an ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base; the formula-determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points; and the ICC-authorized equity ratio, and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Turning to Page 15. Here, we outline the previously mentioned complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
In the first case, last December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE and the FERC is expected to issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. In the second case, in late June, the FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 9.7% base allowed ROE, with a final FERC decision expected in the second quarter of next year. 
As a result of these pending cases and consistent with the ALJ ruling in each case, we have accrued [ph] a reserve for potential refunds of $58 million as of June 30, 2016. 
Finally, turning to Page 16, I will summarize. Year-to-date in 2016, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and we have delivered solid second quarter and year-to-date results. Our solid year-to-date results allowed us to increase our full year earnings guidance range for 2016. 
Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. 
When you combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which provides investors with a yield of approximately 3.3% and which is above average compared to fully regulated utility peers, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

I think, as it relates to energy efficiency, you got to keep in mind that some of what we've quantified is year-over-year comparative impacts from last year to this year. So when we think about that, you got to remember that the construct of the energy efficiency plan in Missouri from 2013 through 2015 was different than the one we've got now. And last year, we were being compensated for some of the efforts associated with energy efficiency and being compensated not only for the current year effects in 2015 but some of the carryover effects to 2016. And so that's creating a bit of a year-over-year comparison, and that's why we've noted some of those effects this year. In terms of the sales trends, what we're seeing, we mentioned this on the call, year-to-date, on a consolidated basis, residential and commercial sales were roughly flat. Frankly, they're up a little bit in Missouri and down a little bit in Illinois. Then industrial sales overall are down about 4%, with Missouri down about 0.5% and Illinois down more significantly. When you actually exclude the impacts of energy efficiency in Missouri, we would actually see overall sales -- instead of being flat, overall sales we'd see up about 1.5%. On the residential, we think they'd be up about 1.3%; commercial, may be up 2%; and industrial, while they're down on a reported basis, may be up 0.5% excluding energy efficiency. So we do see those programs as having an effect, both the programs we've put in place last year having a carryover effect to this year, but also the current year programs that we've now put into place. So they are having an impact, but overall, sales are about where we thought. We said they -- we thought they'd be about flattish because of the effects of energy efficiency, and that's about where they are. I think, economically, unemployment's running pretty good in Missouri, frankly. I think you probably saw, nationally, the unemployment was at about 4.9% now for the past couple of months. What we're seeing in Missouri is it's actually run a little bit below that, closer to 4%, while unfortunately, on the Illinois side, where we're seeing some of the industrial sales declines seeing unemployment a little bit higher over there at about 6%. But overall, I think the economies are remaining stable. We're seeing a little bit of growth, I'd say, in Missouri, especially when you strip out energy efficiency. And in Illinois, while the industrial sales are down, we're still seeing some growth in terms of residential and commercial demand, which we see as a positive."

I think that as you to think about the 5% to 8% growth over time as we've said repeatedly, that's really anchored by the 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. And so that really is the foundation. And then when you think about whether we would be above that or below that from an earnings per share growth perspective, certainly, changes in treasury rates or earned ROEs, sales growth levels, spending levels, regulatory decisions, all of those things can push you up or down within that range. And look, it's a 5-year outlook going out to 2020, so a number of things can happen over that time, and that's why we have sort of a $0.40 range when you look out to 2020. As it relates to the current impact of the 30-year treasuries as we mentioned on the call, we have booked to a lower treasury yield than we expected at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, we had expected treasury yields to be around 3.2%. What we've booked to as of the end of June is an average rate for the year of about 2.65%. And of course, the current 30-day treasuries are sitting at 2.25%  So that has caused us to change our outlook for this year. We've baked that into our guidance range for this year. I'd remind you that a 50 basis point move in ROEs in the Ameren Illinois delivery business is about $0.025. So that gives you a sensitivity, but we've baked that into our current year guidance. We feel very good about the guidance. We were able to raise it $0.05, as you know, this year, which is a positive. It's net of the impacts of those changes in 30-year treasuries. And as it relates to our long-term guidance, we obviously update our overall thoughts about how we're going to manage the business going forward on an annual basis. But right now, we feel very good about that 6.5% rate base growth and that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth that we've projected."

Good question. And I think if you look back at our ""beginning of the year"" guidance and then walk through our first quarter or now our second quarter disclosures, you can piece some of these things together, and you've got some of those. I think as it relates to -- starting with our guidance at the beginning of the year and thinking about how it moved, we had an $0.08-or-so pickup from the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter, which was a positive. At that same time, we also had a couple of additional cents of decline due to this Noranda outage. We started the year thinking it was going to be about a $0.13 impact and now we're at about $0.15 impact. We also had -- as you mentioned, we've now had a little bit of a lowered expectation in terms of the treasury rates and again, that -- like you said, that has impacted us by $0.02 or $0.03 there as well. So those are some of the impacts that we had. Now in the first quarter, we also had negative weather. It was about $0.05 negative in the first quarter. As mentioned on the call, we had positive weather here in the second quarter, which more than offset more about $0.01 positive now for weather year-to-date. So when you look at that -- if you look at that, where we are at the end of 6 months, you get that tax gain that we experienced in the first quarter. You got about $0.01 of positive weather, and we've had some offsets due to the decline in the treasuries and then this temporary impact of the Noranda outage that we're experiencing this year. So those are some of the things that were pluses and minuses versus our original expectations and why we were positioned then with a backdrop of very solid operations and very solid execution of our strategy and our plan for this year that we're able to raise the guidance by $0.05."

They're really looking to get some outside perspectives. And I think, to me, the one thing that's really positive in all of this is there's a recognition of the issue. Now there's not tremendous consensus on what the solution is yet, but there's a recognition of the issue, and that's where this whole thing starts. Once we have the problem identified, we can figure out how to go about and come through, through debate and dialogue, come up with the right solution.

This earnings increase reflected hig",1545,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Today, we announced second quarter 2016 core earnings of $0.61 per share compared to core earnings of $0.58 per share in last year's second quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales of Noranda Aluminum, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks to better serve our customers. 
These favorable items were partially offset by expenses for the 2016 scheduled Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage as well as lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. 
Earlier this year, Noranda idled production at a smelter, and the plant remains shut down. Overall, our second quarter results were solid as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy, and I am pleased to report that we have raised our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting year-to-date results. 
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continue to strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. 
I would like to take a moment and highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. To begin, our accomplishments include continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks to provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. 
As you can see, year-to-date, we invested almost $650 million of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 investments and included approximately $330 million of capital spent on FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this project's 9 line segments is complete, with construction of 3 other segments and 2 of 3 river crossings well under way. Further, 2 of the project's 10 substations are already in service with remaining 8 under construction. 
For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are acquiring the balance of the needed right-of-way, and we plan to begin line construction later this year. 
As for the Mark Twain project, we are in the process of obtaining assents from the 5 counties this transmission line will cross and have begun right-of-way acquisition. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved multi-value projects. When completed, they will deliver significant customer benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. 
We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $320 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 6 months. These include investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and smart meter goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages due to our smart grid investments. 
In addition, natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are improving the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system. 
Turning now to Missouri. First, on May 10, we safely completed the 21st nuclear refueling and maintenance outage for our Callaway Energy Center ahead of schedule. 
In addition, Ameren Missouri continues to aggressively manage those costs that are under its control. Our success in this area has helped maintain electric rates that are the lowest of any investor-owned utility in Missouri and are well below the Midwest and national averages. 
While we are taking actions to keep our electric rates among the lowest in the country, we also need to take action to begin recovery of energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates. As a result, in early July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission, or PSC, for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue. This request includes recovery of, and return on, the new infrastructure investments I just mentioned, including those from nuclear safety, environmental controls, transmission line improvements and reliability. 
In addition, the filing includes recovery of fixed costs related to the loss of sales to Noranda as well as increased MISO transmission charges. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this proceeding in late April of next year. Marty will discuss this rate filing further in a moment. 
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, comprehensive, performance-based ratemaking legislation was not enacted by the Missouri General Assembly before its session ended in mid-May as a result of a filibuster by a small group of state senators. Since then, 2 separate efforts have been initiated by the state to address the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri energy infrastructure. 
One of these efforts is an undertaking under Missouri PSC and the other is the work of a Senate Interim Committee. 
The stated purpose of the Missouri PSC's effort is to consider policies to improve the way in which the commission regulates Missouri's investor-owned electric utilities; and the stated objective of the Senate Interim Committee is to evaluate ways utility regulatory process in Missouri might be modernized in order to ensure sustained investment in utility infrastructure while, at the same time, promoting interest of fairness among all constituencies, including customers and shareholders. We are pleased, and we are -- certainly appreciate that the Missouri PSC and the Senate Interim Committee are taking the time and effort to study this important issue. I am convinced that improvements to Missouri's regulatory framework are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri as we seek to implement a smarter grid, transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio as well as create jobs. 
We have filed comments with the Missouri PSC, and we will be actively engaged in both proceedings this summer and fall. 
In addition, we continue to engage with other key stakeholders involved in the process to explore constructive paths forward to support investment in Missouri's aging infrastructure. 
As I wrap up my business update, I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have maintained their relentless focus on executing our strategy, which is enabling us to deliver safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers and the communities we serve. Their actions have included working under challenging and hot operating conditions in the field and in our energy centers, responding to our customers' needs in a timely manner when faced with periodic summer storms, using innovation to meet our customers' rising expectations as well as making our operations even more efficient, and most importantly, doing all of these things with safety being at the top of their mind. 
Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we will be relentless in our efforts to improve our operating and financial performance, including maintaining our strong focus on safety as well as exercising disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. And we will continue to focus on meeting and exceeding our customers' energy needs and expectations and ultimately delivering superior long-term value to you, our shareholders. 
Speaking of delivering superior value to our shareholders, I will now move to Page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our above-peer-average rate based growth plan reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks, and our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. 
We stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. 
We also remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated-utility peers. 
Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, results in superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there",1477,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for this year's second quarter. 
Moving then to Page 10. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.03 per share increase in second quarter 2016 results compared to prior year quarter results. In 2016, we experienced higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales to Noranda, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. These temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.07 per share versus 2015 and $0.06 per share versus normal conditions. 
Moving to the next key driver of the second quarter earnings variance. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the year-ago period and net of changes in returns on equity. Our Illinois electric distribution business results incorporated an 8.45% allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking compared to 8.75% for the year-ago period based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.65% for the full year. 
Moving to the next 2 items on the page. Earnings for the second quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas distribution service rates effective this year as well as the decline in other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers, regulatory trackers or formula rates, each adding $0.02 per share compared to the prior year period. 
Shifting now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the second quarter earnings comparison. The scheduled 2016 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage reduced second quarter 2016 earnings by $0.07 per share compared to 2015 when there was no refueling outage.  The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of next year. 
The previously mentioned idling of Noranda smelter potlines reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. And finally, the quarter-over-quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan negatively affected the earnings comparison by $0.04 per share. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date. Overall, we experienced sales trends similar to those discussed on our first quarter call. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. 
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 5%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down 0.5%. 
Turning to Page 11 of our presentation. Now I would like to move from this discussion of sales to our guidance for the full year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This increased guidance reflects solid year-to-date results, including a first quarter tax gain associated with the new accounting rule and an estimated $0.01 per share first half weather benefit compared to normal, as warmer-than-normal second quarter temperatures more than offset milder-than-normal first quarter temperatures. 
Regarding Noranda, we continue to expect the unfavorable impact of lower electric sales to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2016. This estimate is net of expected revenues from all system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under our provision of our fuel adjustment clause. We continue to expect Noranda's smelter to remain idle for the rest of this year and that this will reduce earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in the third quarter and approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year periods. 
I will not go through the other earnings considerations listed on this page because they are largely self-explanatory, and we discussed them on our February earnings call. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, we are falling short of this goal in Missouri in 2016, due in large part to the Noranda sales losses. 
Moving to Page 12. Here, we begin to outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate case, which Warner mentioned earlier. 
Earlier this week, parties to this proceeding jointly proposed a schedule to the Missouri Public Service Commission, and key dates of the proposed schedule are listed on this page. We expect the Public Service Commission to decide the case by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May. 
Further, on Page 13, you can see that 3/4 of our $206 million request is driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers; adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales, largely driven by the idling of Noranda smelter; and recovery of increased MISO transmission charges. To address the regulatory lag associated with these increasing transmission expenses, we have requested the implementation of a new MISO transmission tracker. 
In addition, the rate filing includes $8 million for amortized recovery of an estimated $81 million of fixed costs not recovered as a result of lower sales to Noranda. 
I would also like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Turning to Page 14. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate filing with the ICC. Under formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois makes such filings to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost to service and to true-up any prior-period over- or under-recovery of such costs. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investments that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end of this year. 
Late last month, Ameren Illinois and the ICC staff entered into a stipulation agreement that resolved all issues currently existing between them and supported an annual revenue requirement that is consistent with Ameren Illinois' filing. The positions for other interveners in the case are noted on this page, and an ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base; the formula-determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points; and the ICC-authorized equity ratio, and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Turning to Page 15. Here, we outline the previously mentioned complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
In the first case, last December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE and the FERC is expected to issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. In the second case, in late June, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 9.7% base allowed ROE, with a final FERC decision expected in the second quarter of next year. 
As a result of these pending cases and consistent with the ALJ ruling in each case, we have accrued [ph] a reserve for potential refunds of $58 million as of June 30, 2016. 
Finally, turning to Page 16, I will summarize. Year-to-date in 2016, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and we have delivered solid second quarter and year-to-date results. Our solid year-to-date results allowed us to increase our full year earnings guidance range for 2016. 
Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. 
When you combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which provides investors with a yield of approximately 3.3% and which is above average compared to fully regulated utility peers, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.

So whe",453,"Yes, sure, Julien. This is Marty. And obviously, a number of questions there. I think, as it relates to energy efficiency, you got to keep in mind that some of what we've quantified is year-over-year comparative impacts from last year to this year. So when we think about that, you got to remember that the construct of the energy efficiency plan in Missouri from 2013 through 2015 was different than the one we've got now. And last year, we were being compensated for some of the efforts associated with energy efficiency and being compensated not only for the current year effects in 2015 but some of the carryover effects to 2016. And so that's creating a bit of a year-over-year comparison, and that's why we've noted some of those effects this year. In terms of the sales trends, what we're seeing, we mentioned this on the call, year-to-date, on a consolidated basis, residential and commercial sales were roughly flat. Frankly, they're up a little bit in Missouri and down a little bit in Illinois. Then industrial sales overall are down about 4%, with Missouri down about 0.5% and Illinois down more significantly. When you actually exclude the impacts of energy efficiency in Missouri, we would actually see overall sales -- instead of being flat, overall sales we'd see up about 1.5%. On the residential, we think they'd be up about 1.3%; commercial, may be up 2% in industrial, while they're down on a reported basis, may be up 0.5% excluding energy efficiency. So we do see those programs as having an effect, both the programs we've put in place last year having a carryover effect to this year, but also the current year programs that we've now put into place. So they are having an impact, but overall, sales are about where we thought. We said they -- we thought they'd be about flattish because of the effects of energy efficiency, and that's about where they are. I think, economically, unemployment's running pretty good in Missouri, frankly. I think you probably saw, nationally, the unemployment was at about 4.9% now for the past couple of months. What we're seeing in Missouri is it's actually run a little bit below that, closer to 4%, while unfortunately, on the Illinois side, where we're seeing some of the industrial sales declines seeing unemployment a little bit higher over there at about 6%. But overall, I think the economies are remaining stable. We're seeing a little bit of growth, I'd say, in Missouri, especially when you strip out energy efficiency. And in Illinois, while the industrial sales are down, we're still seeing some growth in terms of residential and commercial demand, which we see as a positive."

I think that as you to think about the 5% to 8% growth over time as we've said repeatedly, that's really anchored by the 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. And so that really is the foundation. And then when you think about whether we would be above that or below that from an earnings per share growth perspective, certainly, changes in treasury rates or earned ROEs, sales growth levels, spending levels, regulatory decisions, all of those things can push you up or down within that range. And look, it's a 5-year outlook going out to 2020, so a number of things can happen over that time, and that's why we have sort of a $0.40 range when you look out to 2020. As it relates to the current impact of the 30-year treasuries as we mentioned on the call, we have booked to a lower treasury yield than we expected at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, we had expected treasury yields to be around 3.2%. What we've booked to as of the end of June is an average rate for the year of about 2.65%. And of course, the current 30-day treasuries are sitting at 2.25%. So that has caused us to change our outlook for this year. We've baked that into our guidance range for this year. I'd remind you that a 50 basis point move in ROEs in the Ameren Illinois delivery business is about $0.025. So that gives you a sensitivity, but we've baked that into our current year guidance. We feel very good about the guidance. We were able to raise it $0.05, as you know, this year, which is a positive. It's net of the impacts of those changes in 30-year treasuries. And as it relates to our long-term guidance, we obviously update our overall thoughts about how we're going to manage the business going forward on an annual basis. But right now, we feel very good about that 6.5% rate base growth and that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth that we've projected."

Good question. And I think if you look back at our ""beginning of the year"" guidance and then walk through our first quarter or now our second quarter disclosures, you can piece some of these things together, and you've got some of those. I think as it relates to -- starting with our guidance at the beginning of the year and thinking about how it moved, we had an $0.08-or-so pickup from the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter, which was a positive. At that same time, we also had a couple of additional cents of decline due to this Noranda outage. We started the year thinking it was going to be about a $0.13 impact and now we're at about $0.15 impact. We also had -- as you mentioned, we've now had a little bit of a lowered expectation in terms of the treasury rates and again, that -- like you said, that has impacted us by $0.02 or $0.03 there as well. So those are some of the impacts that we had. Now in the first quarter, we also had negative weather. It was about $0.05 negative in the first quarter. As mentioned on the call, we had positive weather here in the second quarter, which more than offset more about $0.01 positive now for weather year-to-date. So when you look at that -- if you look at that, where we are at the end of 6 months, you get that tax gain that we experienced in the first quarter. You got about $0.01 of positive weather, and we've had some offsets due to the decline in the treasuries and then this temporary impact of the Noranda outage that we're experiencing this year. So those are some of the things that were pluses and minuses versus our original expectations and why we were positioned then with a backdrop of very solid operations and very solid execution of our strategy and our plan for this year that we're able to raise the guidance by $0.05."

So I fully expect the commission to carefully look at these things, to engage with stakeholders as well as the Senate Interim Committee to try and advance Missouri forward.

Today, we announced second quarter 2016 core earnings of $0.61 per share compared to core earnings of $0.58 per share in last year's second quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales of Noranda Aluminum, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. 
The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission and Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern constructive regulatory frameworks to better serve our customers. 
These favorable items were partially offset by expenses for the 2016 scheduled Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage as well as lower electric sales to Noranda Aluminum, historically Ameren Missouri's largest customer. 
Earlier this year, Noranda idled production at a smelter, and the plant remains shut down. Overall, our second quarter results were solid as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy, and I am pleased to report that we have raised our 2016 guidance to a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting year-to-date results. 
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We remain focused on executing this strategy and continue to strongly believe that we'll deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. 
I would like to take a moment and highlight some of our year-to-date efforts and accomplishments towards this end. To begin, our accomplishments include continued strategic allocation of significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks to provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of the slide. 
As you can see, year-to-date, we invested almost $650 million of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 investments and included approximately $330 million of capital spent on FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these is ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. Construction of the first of this project's 9 line segments is complete, with construction of 3 other segments and 2 of 3 river crossings well under way. Further, 2 of the project's 10 substations are already in service with remaining 8 under construction. 
For ATXI's Spoon River project in Northwestern Illinois, we are acquiring the balance of the needed right-of-way, and we plan to begin line construction later this year. 
As for the Mark Twain project, we are in the process of obtaining assents from the 5 counties this transmission line will cross and have begun right-of-way acquisition. All 3 of these transmission projects, Illinois Rivers, Spoon River and Mark Twain, are MISO-approved multi-value projects. When completed, they will deliver significant customer benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the western and northern parts of the MISO region. 
We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid. 
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan at Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $320 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 6 months. These include investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by Illinois' Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This work remains on track to meet or exceed its investment, reliability and smart meter goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages due to our smart grid investments. 
In addition, natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are improving the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system. 
Turning now to Missouri. First, on May 10, we safely completed the 21st nuclear refueling and maintenance outage for our Callaway Energy Center ahead of schedule. 
In addition, Ameren Missouri continues to aggressively manage those costs that are under its control. Our success in this area has helped maintain electric rates that are the lowest of any investor-owned utility in Missouri and are well below the Midwest and national averages. 
While we are taking actions to keep our electric rates among the lowest in the country, we also need to take action to begin recovery of energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates. As a result, in early July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission, or PSC, for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue. This request includes recovery of, and return on, the new infrastructure investments I just mentioned, including those from nuclear safety, environmental controls, transmission line improvements and reliability. 
In addition, the filing includes recovery of fixed costs related to the loss of sales to Noranda as well as increased MISO transmission charges. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this proceeding in late April of next year. Marty will discuss this rate filing further in a moment. 
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. As you know, comprehensive, performance-based ratemaking legislation was not enacted by the Missouri General Assembly before its session ended in mid-May as a result of a filibuster by a small group of state senators. Since then, 2 separate efforts have been initiated by the state to address the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri energy infrastructure. 
One of these efforts is an undertaking under Missouri PSC and the other is the work of a Senate Interim Committee. 
The stated purpose of the Missouri PSC's effort is to consider policies to improve the way in which the commission regulates Missouri's investor-owned electric utilities; and the stated objective of the Senate Interim Committee is to evaluate ways utility regulatory process in Missouri might be modernized in order to ensure sustained investment in utility infrastructure while, at the same time, promoting interest of fairness among all constituencies, including customers and shareholders. We are pleased, and we are -- certainly appreciate that the Missouri PSC and the Senate Interim Committee are taking the time and effort to study this important issue. I am convinced that improvements to Missouri's regulatory framework are in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri as we seek to implement a smarter grid, transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio as well as create jobs. 
We have filed comments with the Missouri PSC, and we will be actively engaged in both proceedings this summer and fall. 
In addition, we continue to engage with other key stakeholders involved in the process to explore constructive paths forward to support investment in Missouri's aging infrastructure. 
As I wrap up my business update, I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all of our coworkers who have maintained their relentless focus on executing our strategy, which is enabling us to deliver safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers and the communities we serve. Their actions have included working under challenging and hot operating conditions in the field and in our energy centers, responding to our customers' needs in a timely manner when faced with periodic summer storms, using innovation to meet our customers' rising expectations as well as making our operations even more efficient, and most importantly, doing all of these things with safety being at the top of their mind. 
Of course, we are not done. Looking ahead, we will be relentless in our efforts to improve our operating and financial performance, including maintaining our strong focus on safety as well as exercising disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. And we will continue to focus on meeting and exceeding our customers' energy needs and expectations and ultimately delivering superior long-term value to you, our shareholders. 
Speaking of delivering superior value to our shareholders, I will now move to Page 7 and our long-term total return outlook. In February, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at an approximate 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 to 2020 period, driven by a strong pipeline of investments to benefit customers and shareholders. Our above-peer-average rate based growth plan reflects strategic allocation of capital to those jurisdictions that operate under constructive and modern regulatory frameworks, and our rate base growth is foundational to our strong earnings per share growth expectations. 
We stated in February that we expected earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, excluding the estimated temporary negative effect on 2016 earnings of lower sales to Noranda. 
We also remain focused on delivering a solid dividend because we recognize its importance to our shareholders. Today, our dividend yield remains above the average of our regulated-utility peers. 
Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and economic and other business conditions. Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, results in superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty. Marty?"

Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there",1477,"Thank you, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 9 of our presentation. Today, we reported second quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, which matched last year's second quarter GAAP earnings. As you can see on this page, there was no difference between GAAP and core results for this year's second quarter. 
Moving then to Page 10. Here, we highlight factors that drove the $0.03 per share increase in second quarter 2016 results compared to prior year quarter results. In 2016, we experienced higher retail electric sales volumes, excluding sales to Noranda, driven by warmer early summer temperatures. These temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.07 per share versus 2015 and $0.06 per share versus normal conditions. 
Moving to the next key driver of the second quarter earnings variance. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the year-ago period and net of changes in returns on equity. Our Illinois electric distribution business results incorporated an 8.45% allowed ROE under formulaic ratemaking compared to 8.75% for the year-ago period based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.65% for the full year. 
Moving to the next 2 items on the page. Earnings for the second quarter also benefited from higher Illinois natural gas distribution service rates effective this year as well as the decline in other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to writers, regulatory trackers or formula rates, each adding $0.02 per share compared to the prior year period. 
Shifting now to factors that had an unfavorable effect on the second quarter earnings comparison. The scheduled 2016 Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage reduced second quarter 2016 earnings by $0.07 per share compared to 2015 when there was no refueling outage.  The next Callaway refueling is scheduled for the fall of next year. 
The previously mentioned idling of Noranda smelter potlines reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. And finally, the quarter-over-quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan negatively affected the earnings comparison by $0.04 per share. 
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date. Overall, we experienced sales trends similar to those discussed on our first quarter call. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers on a combined basis were essentially flat as the 2016 leap day sales benefit was offset by energy efficiency impacts. 
Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 5%, primarily reflecting lower sales to several large low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steelmaking, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. Excluding lower sales to Noranda, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down 0.5%. 
Turning to Page 11 of our presentation. Now I would like to move from this discussion of sales to our guidance for the full year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This increased guidance reflects solid year-to-date results, including a first quarter tax gain associated with the new accounting rule and an estimated $0.01 per share first half weather benefit compared to normal, as warmer-than-normal second quarter temperatures more than offset milder-than-normal first quarter temperatures. 
Regarding Noranda, we continue to expect the unfavorable impact of lower electric sales to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2016. This estimate is net of expected revenues from all system sales that Ameren Missouri is making as a result of reduced sales to Noranda and that are retained under our provision of our fuel adjustment clause. We continue to expect Noranda's smelter to remain idle for the rest of this year and that this will reduce earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in the third quarter and approximately $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year periods. 
I will not go through the other earnings considerations listed on this page because they are largely self-explanatory, and we discussed them on our February earnings call. 
Overall, our goal remains to earn at or close to our allowed ROEs in all of our jurisdictions. Of course, we are falling short of this goal in Missouri in 2016, due in large part to the Noranda sales losses. 
Moving to Page 12. Here, we begin to outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate case, which Warner mentioned earlier. 
Earlier this week, parties to this proceeding jointly proposed a schedule to the Missouri Public Service Commission, and key dates of the proposed schedule are listed on this page. We expect the Public Service Commission to decide the case by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May. 
Further, on Page 13, you can see that 3/4 of our $206 million request is driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers; adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales, largely driven by the idling of Noranda smelter; and recovery of increased MISO transmission charges. To address the regulatory lag associated with these increasing transmission expenses, we have requested the implementation of a new MISO transmission tracker. 
In addition, the rate filing includes $8 million for amortized recovery of an estimated $81 million of fixed costs not recovered as a result of lower sales to Noranda. 
I would also like to update you on select regulatory matters pending at the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Turning to Page 14. In April, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate filing with the ICC. Under formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois makes such filings to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost to service and to true-up any prior-period over- or under-recovery of such costs. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investments that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end of this year. 
Late last month, Ameren Illinois and the ICC staff entered into a stipulation agreement that resolved all issues currently existing between them and supported an annual revenue requirement that is consistent with Ameren Illinois' filing. The positions for other interveners in the case are noted on this page, and an ICC decision is expected in December of this year, with new rates effective early next year. 
I'll remind you that each year's Illinois electric distribution earnings are a function of that year's ending rate base; the formula-determined allowed ROE, which is the annual average of 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields for that year plus 580 basis points; and the ICC-authorized equity ratio, and are not directly determined by that year's rate update filing. 
Turning to Page 15. Here, we outline the previously mentioned complaint cases pending at the FERC that seek to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
In the first case, last December, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 10.32% base allowed ROE and the FERC is expected to issue a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. In the second case, in late June, a FERC administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending a 9.7% base allowed ROE, with a final FERC decision expected in the second quarter of next year. 
As a result of these pending cases and consistent with the ALJ ruling in each case, we have accrued [ph] a reserve for potential refunds of $58 million as of June 30, 2016. 
Finally, turning to Page 16, I will summarize. Year-to-date in 2016, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, and we have delivered solid second quarter and year-to-date results. Our solid year-to-date results allowed us to increase our full year earnings guidance range for 2016. 
Further, on our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the estimated temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda this year. We said this earnings growth was driven by approximately 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions being made for the benefit of customers. 
When you combine our strong earnings growth with Ameren's dividend, which provides investors with a yield of approximately 3.3% and which is above average compared to fully regulated utility peers, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

So whe",453,"Yes, sure, Julien. This is Marty. And obviously, a number of questions there. I think, as it relates to energy efficiency, you got to keep in mind that some of what we've quantified is year-over-year comparative impacts from last year to this year. So when we think about that, you got to remember that the construct of the energy efficiency plan in Missouri from 2013 through 2015 was different than the one we've got now. And last year, we were being compensated for some of the efforts associated with energy efficiency and being compensated not only for the current year effects in 2015 but some of the carryover effects to 2016. And so that's creating a bit of a year-over-year comparison, and that's why we've noted some of those effects this year. In terms of the sales trends, what we're seeing, we mentioned this on the call, year-to-date, on a consolidated basis, residential and commercial sales were roughly flat. Frankly, they're up a little bit in Missouri and down a little bit in Illinois. Then industrial sales overall are down about 4%, with Missouri down about 0.5% and Illinois down more significantly. When you actually exclude the impacts of energy efficiency in Missouri, we would actually see overall sales -- instead of being flat, overall sales we'd see up about 1.5%. On the residential, we think they'd be up about 1.3%; commercial, may be up 2% in industrial, while they're down on a reported basis, may be up 0.5% excluding energy efficiency. So we do see those programs as having an effect, both the programs we've put in place last year having a carryover effect to this year, but also the current year programs that we've now put into place. So they are having an impact, but overall, sales are about where we thought. We said they -- we thought they'd be about flattish because of the effects of energy efficiency, and that's about where they are. I think, economically, unemployment's running pretty good in Missouri, frankly. I think you probably saw, nationally, the unemployment was at about 4.9% now for the past couple of months. What we're seeing in Missouri is it's actually run a little bit below that, closer to 4%, while unfortunately, on the Illinois side, where we're seeing some of the industrial sales declines seeing unemployment a little bit higher over there at about 6%. But overall, I think the economies are remaining stable. We're seeing a little bit of growth, I'd say, in Missouri, especially when you strip out energy efficiency. And in Illinois, while the industrial sales are down, we're still seeing some growth in terms of residential and commercial demand, which we see as a positive."

And then when you think about whether we would be above that or below that from an earnings per share growth perspective, certainly, changes in treasury rates or earned ROEs, sales growth levels, spending levels, regulatory decisions, all of those things can push you up or down within that range. And look, it's a 5-year outlook going out to 2020, so a number of things can happen over that time, and that's why we have sort of a $0.40 range when you look out to 2020. As it relates to the current impact of the 30-year treasuries as we mentioned on the call, we have booked to a lower treasury yield than we expected at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, we had expected treasury yields to be around 3.2%. What we've booked to as of the end of June is an average rate for the year of about 2.65%. And of course, the current 30-day treasuries are sitting at 2.25%. So that has caused us to change our outlook for this year. We've baked that into our guidance range for this year. I'd remind you that a 50 basis point move in ROEs in the Ameren Illinois delivery business is about $0.025. So that gives you a sensitivity, but we've baked that into our current year guidance. We feel very good about the guidance. We were able to raise it $0.05, as you know, this year, which is a positive. It's net of the impacts of those changes in 30-year treasuries. And as it relates to our long-term guidance, we obviously update our overall thoughts about how we're going to manage the business going forward on an annual basis. But right now, we feel very good about that 6.5% rate base growth and that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth that we've projected."

Good question. And I think if you look back at our ""beginning of the year"" guidance and then walk through our first quarter or now our second quarter disclosures, you can piece some of these things together, and you've got some of those. I think as it relates to -- starting with our guidance at the beginning of the year and thinking about how it moved, we had an $0.08-or-so pickup from the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter, which was a positive. At that same time, we also had a couple of additional cents of decline due to this Noranda outage. We started the year thinking it was going to be about a $0.13 impact and now we're at about $0.15 impact. We also had -- as you mentioned, we've now had a little bit of a lowered expectation in terms of the treasury rates and again, that -- like you said, that has impacted us by $0.02 or $0.03 there as well. So those are some of the impacts that we had. Now in the first quarter, we also had negative weather. It was about $0.05 negative in the first quarter. As mentioned on the call, we had positive weather here in the second quarter, which more than offset more about $0.01 positive now for weather year-to-date. So when you look at that -- if you look at that, where we are at the end of 6 months, you get that tax gain that we experienced in the first quarter. You got about $0.01 of positive weather, and we've had some offsets due to the decline in the treasuries and then this temporary impact of the Noranda outage that we're experiencing this year. So those are some of the things that were pluses and minuses versus our original expectations and why we were positioned then with a backdrop of very solid operations and very solid execution of our strategy and our plan for this year that we're able to raise the guidance by $0.05."

But secondly, I know that Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and then certainly the utility group, they filed specific suggestions, and there was a host of suggestions to try and address this issue. So I fully expect the commission to carefully look at these things, to engage with stakeholders as well as the Senate Interim Committee to try and advance Missouri forward.

We strongly believe that this is not only an opportunity but one of these things that is really imperative for Missouri to move forward without constructive policies.

Now there's not tremendous consensus on what the solution is yet, but there's a recognition of the issue, and that's where this whole thing starts. Once we have the problem identified, we can figure out how to go about and come through, through debate and dialogue, come up with the right solution.

As you said, we do believe the industry will continue to consolidate, and certainly, in the past, we have obviously participated in some level of consolidation. And so the bottom line is we're focused on our organic growth plan, we're attentive to what's going on in the industry, and we'll simply just continue to execute, execute, execute. Period."

Today, we announced third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared to earnings of $1.41 per share in last year's third quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers, driven by warmer summer temperatures. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. These favorable items were partially offset by lower electric sales to the New Madrid aluminum smelter, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Earlier this year, operations at the smelter were suspended and it remains shut down.
Overall, our third quarter results were strong as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy. And I am pleased to report that for the second time this year, we have raised our 2016 earnings guidance. Our new guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75 per share, up from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share reflecting the strong year-to-date results.
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We continue to successfully execute this strategy and remain convinced that it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to take a few moments and highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments towards this end. To begin, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, year-to-date, we've invested almost $1 billion of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 capital spending and included approximately $510 million of investment and FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these remains ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. 4 of these projects 9 line segments, including 2 river crossings have been energized and work on the other segments and the third river crossing is well underway. Further, in the projects 10 substations are now in service with the remaining 2 under construction. Regarding ATXI's $150 million Spoon River project in the Western Illinois, content is being completed on some substations. In addition, we are acquiring the balance of new right-of-way [ph] and have just begun clearing land on certain sections of the project, with significant line construction expected to begin in January.
As for the $225 million Mark Twain project in Northeast Missouri, we recently initiated court proceedings in order to obtain a sense of road crosses from the 5 counties where the line is planned to be constructed. When completed, these 3 MISO multi-value projects will deliver significant customer and community benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the Western and Northern parts of MISO region, including Northeast Missouri. In addition, these projects are creating jobs. We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission system that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan in Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $480 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 9 months of this year. This included investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. In September, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' request to expand the installation of smart electric meters from 62% to 100% of customers. This approval is a testament to the smart meter benefits achieved so far and takes advantage of the infrastructure, processes and teams already in place to efficiently and effectively deploy additional new meters.
As you see, approval of this request also supports increased in the installation of smart gas meter modules from 56% to 100% of customers. The approximately $150 million incremental investment to expand deployment of electric and gas smart meters to all of our Illinois customers was included in the multiyear capital spending plan we shared with you earlier this year. As you can see on the right side of this page, Ameren Illinois plans to install approximately 1.25 million advanced electric meters and upgrade approximately 830,000 gas meter modules by the end of 2019. Through September of this year, approximately 352,000 electric and 178,000 gas meters have been installed. Since we began to deploy advanced metering technology, Ameren Illinois has reduced estimated meter reads by over 440,000 and eliminated the need for nearly 100,000 service visits.  
Lastly, this year, Ameren Illinois launched a peak time rewards program, allowing customers with new smart meters to manage usage during peak summer days. More than 8,000 participated, saving an estimated 47,000 kilowatt hours. Clearly, this Smart Grid investments are saving Ameren Illinois customers money by allowing them to better manage power usage when they experience fewer and shorter power outages. In fact, the frequency and duration of Ameren Illinois' power outages have been reduced by averages of 17% and 18%, respectively, from the baseline set by the state's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. As a result, Ameren Illinois' electric distribution initiatives remain on track to meet or exceed investment, liability and smart meter goals established in this act.
In addition, Ameren Illinois' enhanced framework for natural gas distribution is driving greater levels of investment in energy infrastructure. This natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are also improving the safety and reliability of that system. It is clear that modernized energy policies in Illinois are driving significant incremental investments in its electric and natural gas energy infrastructure. Together, these investments are not only delivering meaningful long-term benefits to our customers at affordable rates, but they have also created a significant number of new jobs in the state of Illinois.
Turning to Page 7 of our presentation, let me provide a business update on Missouri. In July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue to begin to recover and earn a return on energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates and to reflect reduced sales due to the suspension of operations at the New Madrid smelter, among other things. Marty will discuss our filing in more detail in a moment. We expect Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this rate review in late April, with new rates expected to be effective in late May of next year.
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. 2 separate efforts were initiated by the state to evaluate the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri's energy infrastructure. One by the Missouri PSC and the other by a Senate Interim Committee. We appreciate the time and effort being undertaken to study this important issue. I will start by providing an update on the Missouri PSC effort. To begin, over the last several months, the Missouri PSC requested and received extensive comments from stakeholders and held a workshop to assist in their consideration of policies to improve the way it regulates electric utilities. 
In this workshop, and later on filings with the PSC, Ameren Missouri highlighted the issues associated with the Missouri's aging energy infrastructure as well as the fact that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately support investment. Our filings also cited several approaches that are being successfully utilized around the country to address the issues that Missouri now faces. Including performance-based formulaic ratemaking and forward test years as well as trackers and writers. Importantly, we highlighted the significant long-term customer and statewide benefits that would be realized by changes in energy policies that will support incremental energy infrastructure investment.
Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and in other jurisdictions around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments would create a more reliable and smarter grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio, as well as create significant jobs. In addition, we believe these investments will position Missouri to keep pace with the evolving electric grid and meet its customers rising energy needs and expectations. We believe the electric system will continue to evolve to a more integrated grid for central and distributed generation, transmission and distribution systems as well as customers and businesses with smart meters, [ph] clients and equipment, all work together to continuously, instantaneously and reliably, maintain the balance between resources and demand. Benefits from such a system must be enabled by investments to support a more sophisticated and resilient transmission and distribution infrastructure. These investments must also be enabled by modernized energy policy. 
With this benefits in mind, in late September, Ameren Missouri filed with the Missouri PSC a detailed plan for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022, with additional projects of more than $1 billion that could be accelerated over this period, should they be deemed appropriate when taking into consideration customer rate impact. Further, we indicated that a total of more than $4 billion potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period has been identified. In that same filing, we outlined several energy policy alternatives that will enable these important investments, which replaced the significant long-term benefits for our customers and the state of Missouri.
On October 17, the Missouri PSC staff issued its report regarding proposed improvements to the state's electric utility regulation. Staff indicated it was not the post to several approaches for supporting targeted investments, which will continue to include strong PSC oversight. These approaches include certain factors and writer, client service accounting, interim rate, forecast and electric infrastructure system replacement. We appreciate your consideration of several tools used in other states to support investment for the benefit of the customers and the state. This report is an important step, and we look forward to continue discussion with all stakeholders.
Turning to the Senate Interim Committee efforts, on August and October, the committee held hearings, which provided for these older stakeholders and outside experts to provide their perspectives in this instance, utility regulation and ultimately modernist to support increased investment. This hubris have been very informative and have provided another opportunity to discuss this important energy policy issue with key stakeholders outside of the very recent legislative session. As we continue to engage with stakeholders, I am more convinced than ever that improvements in Missouri's regulatory framework were in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri. We expect reports of the Missouri PSC in the Senate Interim Committee to be issued no later than December 1 and December 31, respectively.
In the meantime, we are also taking other steps to better position Missouri for the future. In particular, we have proposed several pilot programs in Missouri to PST. The pilot program offering customers subscription-based solar power has been approved by the Missouri PSC, a white pilot programs for building solar facilities in partnership with large customers and for building electric vehicle charging stations along our corridor in the state are pending before the committee.
I will now move to Page 8 and our long-term rate base outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 through 2020 period. Our execution of these plan remains on track. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is a being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas distribution services, as these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and advanced provided significant long-term benefits to our customer.
Turning now to Page 9. Here, you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the good news to be modernized to meet our customers future energy needs and expectations. As you can see on the right side of this page, the allocation of capital to transmission and electric and gas distribution is expected to grow these businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by year-end 2020. Further, we are focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diversed portfolio in a responsible fashion. Consequently, our investment in coal and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to 15% of rate base by year-end 2020. This transition will continue beyond 2020 with the retirement of our Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next integrated resource plan, which will be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment, and of course, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 10, in addition to progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, as just mentioned, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2020. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and gas distribution systems in the state. This includes investments to upgrade and replace gas transmission pipeline and storage utility and distribution infrastructure through expected new federal safety deregulations. Further, we expect we continue to invest in local electric transmission project to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet market requirements, replaced aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. We also plan to pursue potential local and regional transmission opportunities to upgrade the grids to maintain system voltages and reliability is generating plants close in response to power market economics of the Clean Power Plan [indiscernible].
Finally, a transmission development team continues to pursue original electric transmission projects focusing on the MISO, PJM and Southwest Power Pool regions. For Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investments. We will continue to provide safe and adequate service, which includes replacing aging transmission and distribution infrastructure when needed. We will also make investments needed to comply with the Clean Power Plan and as discussed earlier, there are also numerous opportunities for incremental investments in Missouri's should let regulatory framework improve. These opportunities include investments in smart meter, replacement of aging substations and other equipment, modernizing the underground grid and transmission as well as adding renewables. Of course, across our entire system, we will also make important investments in information technology and cybersecurity. The bottom lines that we believe, the investment opportunities that I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders in the decade ahead.
Turning now to Page 11. Let me conclude my comments leave it with him that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking and in areas that provide long-term value to our customers. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend of 3.5% to $0.44 per share, reflecting confidence in our outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. This increase resulted in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and other business conditions.
Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently yielding approximately 3.6% results in a superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. To summarize, we are committed to executing our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight",1869,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.11 per share year-over-year increase.
Warmer temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.11 per share versus 2015 and $0.10 per share versus normal condition as we experienced the fourth hottest third quarter, including the hottest September since 1970. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure and our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.09 per share, including changes in allowed returns on equity compared to the year-ago period.
With regard to returns on equity, third quarter 2016 result from our FERC-regulated transmission businesses that if we did from a temporary higher ROE as it compared to the prior period, reflecting the expiration in May of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The first quarter in the first complaint case that lowered to the ROE in late September to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point.
Turning to our Illinois electric distribution business. Third quarter results reflected a reduced ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.29% compared to 8.67% for the year-ago period. The third quarter 2016 allowed ROE was based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.49% for the full year 2016. Factors that had unfavorable effect on third quarter earnings comparisons included the loss of sales to the New Madrid smelter and increased Ameren Missouri depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share, respectively. And finally, the year-over-year third quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan for earnings neutral has the carry over effect of lower sales resulting from this plan were offset by recognition of $19 million or $0.05 per share for a portion of the performance incentive award associated with energy efficiency results achieved over the 2013 through 2015 period. In total, based on a stipulation and agreement approved by the Missouri PSC earlier this week, Ameren Missouri will recognize $28 million or $0.07 per share of total incentive award in 2016, including the previously mentioned $0.05 per share in the third quarter and an additional $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. We are pleased that we're able to reach agreement with the PSC staff and the Office of Public Counsel on this incentive awards and believe this outcome reflects the tremendous success of the 2013 through 2015 program for our customer.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date compared to the prior year. Overall, we experienced trends similar to those discussed on our last 2 quarterly calls, although we did see some improvement in the third quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales through Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers, on a combined basis, were up slightly year-to-date as underlying growth and the lead days sales benefit more than offset energy efficiency impact. Kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 2% year-to-date, primarily reflecting lower sales to several low margin Illinois customers, including those in steel making, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we have seen improvement in the second and third quarters as industrial sales levels appeared to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Finally, kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down approximately 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the Noranda smelter.
Turning to Page 14 of our presentation, I would like to move from this discussion of the sale through a discussion of our earnings guidance for the year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, and our original February guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The increased guidance from February reflects strong year-to-date results, including the first quarter $0.09 per share tax benefit associated with share-based compensation, an estimated $0.11 per share weather benefit compared to normal, driven by warmer summer temperatures as well as disciplined cost management. Factors that are expected to have a favorable effect on year-over-year fourth quarter result included an assumed return to normal temperatures compared to much milder than normal temperatures in last year's fourth quarter, continued increased electric transmission and distribution infrastructure investment by ATXI and Ameren Illinois, as well as higher Illinois natural gas distribution rate in 2016. Factors that are expected to have an unfavorable effect of the earnings comparisons include carryover impacts of Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan, with the recognition of the majority of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency performance incentive award in the third quarter, we revised the expected unfavorable year-over-year fourth quarter impact of the 2015 plan to $0.08 per share from our prior estimate of $0.03 per share. Further, we expect the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings comparison to be unfavorably affected by lower sales to the smelter and regulatory lag related to increased Missouri adoption and transmission expenses.
Moving to Page 15. Here we highlight select spending regulatory matters. Started with Missouri, in our pending electric rate review, we requested a $206 million annual revenue increase but it's primarily driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rate to reflect reduced customer sales initiative and baby suspension of operation at the New Madrid smelter, and recover increase MISO transmission charges. To address the last item, we've also requested the implementation of our new MISO transmission tracker in the rate review. We expect the Missouri PSC to complete their review by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May.
Moving on, Ameren Illinois make it's required and what electric distribution rate update filing with the ICC in April of this year under Illinois' formula ratemaking framework. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement, consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investment that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end this year.
Last week, ALJ proposed order recommended a $14 million net revenue requirement decrease, in line with our filing. This recommendation is further evidenced of the ecosystem to come constructive treatment Ameren Illinois under the state distinct electric formula ratemaking framework. And ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rate effective early next year. Finally, in the first of the 2 complaint cases that sought to reduce the base annulled ROE for MISO commencing owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, the FERC issued its initiatives order in September, adopting a 10.32%-based ROE in line with the ALJ's recommendation. In the second case, the FERC ALJ has recommended a 9.7%-based ROE and the FERC order is expected in the second quarter of next year. As a result of these cases, we have accrued a reserve for estimated refund of $61 million as of September 30, 2016 that is consistent with the FERC's order on the first is in the ALJs recommendation in the second case. In addition to the MISO-based ROE, Ameren Illinois and ATXI received a FERC-approved ROE editor of up to 50 basis points, effective in January 2015 for their participation in MISO.
Moving now to Page 16. We plan to provide 2017 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter result in February of next year. However, using our 2016 year-to-date financial results and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under formula forward-looking ratemaking. However, we expect these earnings to be unfavorably impacted by a projected lower weighted average annulled ROE in 2017 compared to 2016. For Ameren Illinois electric distribution service, we anticipate increased earnings in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made there under Illinois' formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average of 2017 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois gas distributable earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investment that are included in the rate on a timely basis under the state gas infrastructure writer.
For Missouri, the 2017 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected by increased Missouri electric service rate to be implemented as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to the front recovery of and the return on new infrastructure investment as well as more recent sales and cost levels. The incorporation of more recent sales level is expected to remove the negative earnings effect from lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison as we now expect an estimated $0.03 per share negative impact from the suspension of operation in the first 5 months of 2017. We expect Ameren Missouri's 2017 result to also reflect regulatory lag associated with the increased adoption, transmission and property tax expenses, particularly in the first 5 months of the year before new rate become effective. Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the $0.07 per share energy efficiency performance incentive award to be recognized in 2016, which I previously discussed. And a return to normal weather in 2017 with reduced combined Ameren ATXI and Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2016, assuming, of course, normal weather in the last quarter of this year. Finally, we expect expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the fall of 2017 to be comparable to those experienced in the spring outage of this year.
Moving then to parent and other. We expect lower tax benefit associated with share-based compensation next year compared to this year.
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We continue to successfully execute our strategy and have delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date result. This result allowed us to increase our 2016 earnings guidance range to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. On our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, using our then adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63 as a base. This earnings outlook was driven by 6.5% compound annual rate-based growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions made for the benefit of customers. Our recently increased dividend provides investors with the yield of approximately 3.6%, which is above average compared to fully FERC-regulated utility peers. When you combine our strong earnings growth outlook with this dividend, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.

Today, we announced third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared to earnings of $1.41 per share in last year's third quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers, driven by warmer summer temperatures. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. These favorable items were partially offset by lower electric sales to the New Madrid aluminum smelter, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Earlier this year, operations at the smelter were suspended and it remains shut down.
Overall, our third quarter results were strong as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy. And I am pleased to report that, for the second time this year, we have raised our 2016 earnings guidance. Our new guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75 per share, up from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share reflecting the strong year-to-date results.
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We continue to successfully execute this strategy and remain convinced it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to take a few moments and highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments towards this end. To begin, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, year-to-date, we've invested almost $1 billion of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 capital spending and included approximately $510 million of investment in FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these remains ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. 4 of these projects 9-line segments, including 2 river crossings, have been energized. And work on the other segments and the third river crossing is well underway. Further, 8 of the projects 10 substations are now in service, with the remaining 2 under construction. Regarding ATXI's $150 million Spoon River project in the Northwestern Illinois, construction is being completed on its 2 substations. In addition, we are acquiring the balance of needed right-of-way and have just begun clearing land on certain sections of the project, with significant line construction expected to begin in January.
As for the $225 million Mark Twain project in Northeast Missouri, we recently initiated court proceedings in order to obtain a sense of road crosses from the 5 counties where the line is planned to be constructed. When completed, these 3 MISO multi-value projects will deliver significant customer and community benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the Western and Northern parts of MISO region, including Northeast Missouri. In addition, these projects are creating jobs. We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission system that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plan in Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $480 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 9 months of this year. This included investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. In September, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' request to expand the installation of smart electric meters from 62% to 100% of customers. This approval is a testament to the smart meter benefits achieved so far and takes advantage of the infrastructure, processes and teams already in place to efficiently and effectively deploy additional new meters.
As you see, approval of this request also supports increased in the installation of smart gas meter modules from 56% to 100% of customers. The approximately $150 million incremental investment to expand deployment of electric and gas smart meters to all of our Illinois customers was included in the multiyear capital spending plan we shared with you earlier this year. As you can see on the right side of this page, Ameren Illinois plans to install approximately 1.25 million advanced electric meters and upgrade approximately 830,000 gas meter modules by the end of 2019. Through September of this year, approximately 352,000 electric and 178,000 gas meters have been installed. Since we began to deploy advanced metering technology, Ameren Illinois has reduced estimated meter reads by over 440,000 and eliminated the need for nearly 100,000 service visits.  
Lastly, this year, Ameren Illinois launched a peak time rewards program, allowing customers with new smart meters to manage usage during peak summer days. More than 8,000 participated, saving an estimated 47,000 kilowatt hours. Clearly, this Smart Grid investments are saving Ameren Illinois customers money by allowing them to better manage power usage when they experience fewer and shorter power outages. In fact, the frequency and duration of Ameren Illinois' power outages have been reduced by averages of 17% and 18%, respectively, from the baseline set by the state's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. As a result, Ameren Illinois' electric distribution initiatives remain on track to meet or exceed investment, liability and smart meter goals established in this act.
In addition, Ameren Illinois' enhanced framework for natural gas distribution is driving greater levels of investment in energy infrastructure. This natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are also improving the safety and reliability of that system. It is clear that modernized energy policies in Illinois are driving significant incremental investments in its electric and natural gas energy infrastructure. Together, these investments are not only delivering meaningful long-term benefits to our customers at affordable rates, but they have also created a significant number of new jobs in the state of Illinois.
Turning to Page 7 of our presentation, let me provide a business update on Missouri. In July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue to begin to recover and earn a return on energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates and to reflect reduced sales due to the suspension of operations at the New Madrid smelter, among other things. Marty will discuss our filing in more detail in a moment. We expect Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this rate review in late April, with new rates expected to be effective in late May of next year.
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. 2 separate efforts were initiated by the state to evaluate the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri's energy infrastructure. One by the Missouri PSC and the other by a Senate Interim Committee. We appreciate the time and effort being undertaken to study this important issue. I will start by providing an update on the Missouri PSC effort. 
To begin, over the last several months, the Missouri PSC requested and received extensive comments from stakeholders and held a workshop to assist in their consideration of policies to improve the way it regulates electric utilities. In this workshop, and later on filings with the PSC, Ameren Missouri highlighted the issues associated with the Missouri's aging energy infrastructure as well as the fact that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately support investment. 
Our filings also cited several approaches that are being successfully utilized around the country to address the issues that Missouri now faces. Including performance-based formulaic ratemaking and forward test years as well as trackers and riders. Importantly, we highlighted the significant long-term customer and statewide benefits that would be realized by changes in energy policies that will support incremental energy infrastructure investment. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and in other jurisdictions around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments would create a more reliable and smarter grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio, as well as create significant jobs. 
In addition, we believe these investments will position Missouri to keep pace with the evolving electric grid and meet its customers rising energy needs and expectations. We believe the electric system will continue to evolve to a more integrated grid for central and distributed generation, transmission and distribution systems as well as customers and businesses with smart meters, clients and equipment all work together to continuously, instantaneously and reliably, maintain the balance between resources and demand. Benefits from such a system must be enabled by investments to support a more sophisticated and resilient transmission and distribution infrastructure. These investments must also be enabled by modernized energy policy. 
With this benefits in mind, in late September, Ameren Missouri filed with the Missouri PSC a detailed plan for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022, with additional projects of more than $1 billion that could be accelerated over this period, should they be deemed appropriate when taking into consideration customer rate impact. Further, we indicated that a total of more than $4 billion potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period has been identified. In that same filing, we outlined several energy policy alternatives that would enable these important investments, which will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers and the state of Missouri.
On October 17, the Missouri PSC staff issued its report regarding proposed improvements to the state's electric utility regulation. The staff indicated it was not opposed to several approaches for supporting targeted investments, which would continue to include strong PSC oversight. These approaches include certain trackers and riders, plant-in-service accounting, interim rate, largely forecast test years and an electric infrastructure system replacement surcharge. We appreciate the staffs consideration of several tools used in other states to support investment for the benefit of customers and the state. This report is an important step, and we look forward to continued discussion with all stakeholders.
Turning to the Senate Interim Committee efforts. In August and October, the committee held hearings, which provided reform for Missouri's stakeholders and outside experts to provide their perspectives in the state's current utility regulation and how it might be modernized to support increased investment. Those hearings have been very informative and have provided another opportunity to discuss this important energy policy issue with key stakeholders outside of the very busy legislative session. As we continue to engage with stakeholders, I am more convinced than ever that improvements in Missouri's regulatory framework were in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri. We expect reports of the Missouri PSC in the Senate Interim Committee to be issued no later than December 1 and December 31, respectively.
In the meantime, we are also taking other steps to better position Missouri for the future. In particular, we have proposed several pilot programs in Missouri to PSC. The pilot program offering customers subscription-based solar power has been approved by the Missouri PSC, our proposed pilot programs for building solar facilities in partnership with large customers and for building electric vehicle charging stations along our corridor in the state are pending before the commission.
I will now move to Page 8 in our long-term rate base growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 through 2020 period. Our execution of these plan remains on track. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital of FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas distribution services, as these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and the investments provided significant long-term benefits to our customer.
Turning now to Page 9. Here, you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the grid needs to be modernized to meet our customers future energy needs and expectations. As you can see on the right side of this page, the allocation of capital to transmission and electric and gas distribution is expected to grow these businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by year-end 2020. Further, we are focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diversed portfolio in a responsible fashion. Consequently, our investment in coal and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to 15% of rate base by year-end 2020. This transition will continue beyond 2020 with the retirement of our Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next integrated resource plan, which will be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment, and of course, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 10, in addition to progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, as just mentioned, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2020. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and gas distribution systems in the state. This includes investments to upgrade and replace gas transmission pipeline, underground storage facility and distribution infrastructure to comply with expected new federal safety regulations. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission project to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet NERC requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. We also plan to pursue potential local and regional transmission opportunities to upgrade the grids to maintain system voltages and reliability as generating plants close in response to power market economics and the Clean Power Plan [indiscernible].
Finally, a transmission development team continues to pursue regional electric transmission projects focusing on the MISO, PJM and Southwest Power Pool region. For Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investments. We will continue to provide safe and adequate service, which includes replacing aging transmission and distribution infrastructure when needed. We will also make investments needed to comply with the Clean Power Plan. And as discussed earlier, there are also numerous opportunities for incremental investments in Missouri should the regulatory framework improve. These opportunities include investments in smart meter, replacement of aging substations and other equipment, modernizing the underground grid and transmission as well as adding renewables. Of course, across our entire system, we will also make important investments in information technology and cybersecurity. The bottom line is that, we believe, the investment opportunities that I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders in the decade ahead.
Turning now to Page 11. Let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking and in areas that provide long-term value to our customers. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend 3.5% to $0.44 per share, reflecting confidence in our outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. This increase resulted in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and other business condition.
Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently yielding approximately 3.6% results in a superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we are committed to executing our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we recorded third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight",1871,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we recorded third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.11 per share year-over-year increase. Warmer temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.11 per share versus 2015 and $0.10 per share versus normal condition as we experienced the fourth hottest third quarter, including the hottest September since 1970. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.09 per share, including changes in allowed returns on equity compared to the year-ago period.
With regard to returns on equity, third quarter 2016 result from our FERC-regulated transmission businesses benefited from a temporarily higher ROE as compared to the prior period, reflecting the expiration in May of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC order in the first complaint case then lowered the ROE in late September to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder.
Turning to our Illinois electric distribution business. Third quarter results reflected a reduced ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.29% compared to 8.67% for the year-ago period. The third quarter 2016 allowed ROE was based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.49% for the full year 2016. Factors that had an unfavorable effect on third quarter earnings comparisons included the loss of sales to the New Madrid smelter and increased Ameren Missouri depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share, respectively. And finally, the year-over-year third quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan for earnings neutral has the carryover effect of lower sales resulting from this plan were offset by recognition of $19 million or $0.05 per share for a portion of the performance incentive award associated with energy efficiency results achieved over the 2013 through 2015 period. 
In total, based on a stipulation and agreement approved by the Missouri PSC earlier this week, Ameren Missouri will recognize $28 million or $0.07 per share of total incentive award in 2016, including the previously mentioned $0.05 per share in the third quarter and an additional $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. We are pleased that we're able to reach agreement with the PSC staff and the Office of Public Counsel on these incentive awards, and believe this outcome reflects the tremendous success of the 2013 through 2015 MEEIA program was for our customer.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date compared to the prior year. Overall, we experienced trends similar to those discussed on our last 2 quarterly calls, although we did see some improvement in the third quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales through Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers, on a combined basis, were up slightly year-to-date as underlying growth and the lead days sales benefit more than offset energy efficiency impact. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 2% year-to-date, primarily reflecting lower sales to several low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steel making, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we have seen improvement in the second and third quarters as industrial sales levels appeared to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down approximately 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the Noranda smelter.
Turning to Page 14 of our presentation, I would like to move from this discussion of sale to a discussion of our earnings guidance for the year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, and our original February guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The increased guidance from February reflects strong year-to-date results, including the first quarter $0.09 per share tax benefit associated with share-based compensation, an estimated $0.11 per share weather benefit compared to normal, driven by warmer summer temperatures as well as disciplined cost management. 
Factors that are expected to have a favorable effect on year-over-year fourth quarter result included an assumed return to normal temperatures compared to much milder than normal temperatures in last year's fourth quarter, continued increased electric transmission and distribution infrastructure investment by ATXI and Ameren Illinois, as well as higher Illinois natural gas distribution rate in 2016. Factors that are expected to have an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons include carryover impacts of Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan, with the recognition of the majority of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency performance incentive award in the third quarter, we revised the expected unfavorable year-over-year fourth quarter impact of the 2015 plan to $0.08 per share from our prior estimate of $0.03 per share. Further, we expect the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings comparison to be unfavorably affected by lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and regulatory lag related to increased Missouri depreciation and transmission expenses.
Moving to Page 15. Here we highlight select pending regulatory matter. Starting with Missouri, in our pending electric rate review, we requested a $206 million annual revenue increase that is primarily driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sale largely driven by the suspension of operation at the New Madrid smelter, and recover increased MISO transmission charges. To address the last item, we have also requested the implementation of our new MISO transmission tracker in the rate review. We expect the Missouri PSC to complete their review by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May.
Moving on, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing with the ICC in April of this year under Illinois' formula ratemaking framework. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement, consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investment that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end this year.
Last week, an ALJ proposed order recommended a $14 million net revenue requirement decrease, in line with our filing. This recommendation is further evidenced of the consistent constructive treatment Ameren Illinois is receiving under the state electric formula ratemaking framework. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. Finally, in the first of the 2 complaint cases that sought to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, the FERC issued its order in September adopting a 10.32% base ROE in line with the ALJ's recommendation. In the second case, the FERC ALJ has recommended a 9.7% base ROE and the FERC order is expected in the second quarter of next year. As a result of these cases, we have accrued a reserve for estimated refund of $61 million as of September 30, 2016, that is consistent with the FERC's order in the first case and the ALJs recommendation in the second case. In addition to the MISO base ROE, Ameren Illinois and ATXI received a FERC-approved ROE adder of up to 50 basis points, effective in January 2015 for their participation in MISO.
Moving now to Page 16. We plan to provide 2017 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter result in February of next year. However, using our 2016 year-to-date financial result and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATX projects made under formula forward-looking ratemaking. However, we expect these earnings to be unfavorably impacted by a projected lower weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to 2016. For Ameren Illinois electric distribution service, we anticipate increased earnings in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made there under Illinois' formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average of 2017 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investment that are included in rate on a timely basis under the state gas infrastructure rider.
For Missouri, the 2017 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected by increased Missouri electric service rate to be implemented as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to reflect recovery of and a return on new infrastructure investment as well as more recent sales and cost levels. The incorporation of more recent sales level is expected to remove the negative earnings effect from lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison as we now expect an estimated $0.03 per share negative impact from the suspension of operation in the first 5 months of 2017. We expect Ameren Missouri's 2017 result to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses, particularly in the first 5 months of the year before new rate become effective. 
Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the $0.07 per share energy efficiency performance incentive award to be recognized in 2016, which I previously discussed. And a returned normal weather in 2017 with reduced combined Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2016, assuming, of course, normal weather in the last quarter of this year. Finally, we expect expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the fall of 2017 to be comparable to those experienced in the spring outage of this year.  Moving then to parent and other. We expect lower tax benefit associated with share-based compensation next year compared to this year.
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We continue to successfully execute our strategy and have delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date result. These results allowed us to increase our 2016 earnings guidance range to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. On our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, using our then adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63 as a base. This earnings growth outlook was driven by 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions made for the benefit of customers. Our recently increased dividend provides investors with the yield of approximately 3.6%, which is above average compared to fully rate-regulated utility peers. When you combine our strong earnings growth outlook with this dividend, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your question."

Today, we announced third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared to earnings of $1.41 per share in last year's third quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers, driven by warmer summer temperatures. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. These favorable items were partially offset by lower electric sales to the New Madrid aluminum smelter, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Earlier this year, operations at the smelter were suspended and it remains shut down.
Overall, our third quarter results were strong as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy. And I am pleased to report that, for the second time this year, we have raised our 2016 earnings guidance. Our new guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75 per share, up from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share reflecting the strong year-to-date results.
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We continue to successfully execute this strategy and remain convinced it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to take a few moments and highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments towards this end. To begin, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, year-to-date, we've invested almost $1 billion of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 capital spending and included approximately $510 million of investment in FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these remains ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. 4 of these projects 9-line segments, including 2 river crossings, have been energized. And work on the other segments and the third river crossing is well underway. Further, 8 of the projects 10 substations are now in service, with the remaining 2 under construction. Regarding ATXI's $150 million Spoon River project in the Northwestern Illinois, construction is being completed on its 2 substations. In addition, we are acquiring the balance of needed right-of-way and have just begun clearing land on certain sections of the project, with significant line construction expected to begin in January.
As for the $225 million Mark Twain project in Northeast Missouri, we recently initiated court proceedings in order to obtain a sense of road crosses from the 5 counties where the line is planned to be constructed. When completed, these 3 MISO multi-value projects will deliver significant customer and community benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the Western and Northern parts of MISO region, including Northeast Missouri. In addition, these projects are creating jobs. We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission system that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plans in Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $480 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 9 months of this year. These included investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. In September, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' request to expand the installation of smart electric meters from 62% to 100% of customers. This approval is a testament to the smart meter benefits achieved so far and takes advantage of the infrastructure, processes and teams already in place to efficiently and effectively deploy additional new meters.
As you see, approval of this request also supports increasing the installation of smart gas meter modules from 56% to 100% of customers. The approximately $150 million incremental investment to expand deployment of electric and gas smart meters to all of our Illinois customers was included in the multiyear capital spending plan we shared with you earlier this year. As you can see on the right side of this page, Ameren Illinois plans to install approximately 1.25 million advanced electric meters and upgrade approximately 830,000 gas meter modules by the end of 2019. Through September of this year, approximately 352,000 electric and 178,000 gas meters have been installed. Since we began to deploy advanced metering technology, Ameren Illinois has reduced estimated meter reads by over 440,000 and eliminated the need for nearly 100,000 service visits.  
Lastly, this year, Ameren Illinois launched a peak time rewards program, allowing customers with new smart meters to manage usage during peak summer days. More than 8,000 participated, saving an estimated 47,000 kilowatt hours. Clearly, these Smart Grid investments are saving Ameren Illinois customers money by allowing them to better manage power usage when they experience fewer and shorter power outages. In fact, the frequency and duration of Ameren Illinois' power outages have been reduced by averages of 17% and 18%, respectively, from the baseline set by the state's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. As a result, Ameren Illinois' electric distribution initiatives remain on track to meet or exceed investment, liability and smart meter goals established in this act.
In addition, Ameren Illinois' enhanced framework for natural gas distribution is driving greater levels of investment in energy infrastructure. These natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are also improving the safety and reliability of that system. It is clear that modernized energy policies in Illinois are driving significant incremental investments in its electric and natural gas energy infrastructure. Together, these investments are not only delivering meaningful long-term benefits to our customers at affordable rates, but they have also created a significant number of new jobs in the state of Illinois.
Turning to Page 7 of our presentation, let me provide a business update on Missouri. In July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue to begin to recover and earn a return on energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates and to reflect reduced sales due to the suspension of operations at the New Madrid smelter, among other things. Marty will discuss our filing in more detail in a moment. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this rate review in late April, with new rates expected to be effective in late May of next year.
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. 2 separate efforts were initiated by the state to evaluate the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri's energy infrastructure. One by the Missouri PSC and the other by a Senate Interim Committee. We appreciate the time and effort being undertaken to study this important issue. I will start by providing an update on the Missouri PSC effort. 
To begin, over the last several months, the Missouri PSC requested and received extensive comments from stakeholders and held a workshop to assist in their consideration of policies to improve the way it regulates electric utilities. In this workshop, and later on filings with the PSC, Ameren Missouri highlighted the issues associated with the Missouri's aging energy infrastructure as well as the fact that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately support investment. 
Our filings also cited several approaches that are being successfully utilized around the country to address the issues that Missouri now faces. Including performance-based formulaic ratemaking and forward test years as well as trackers and riders. Importantly, we highlighted the significant long-term customer and statewide benefits that would be realized by changes in energy policies that will support incremental energy infrastructure investment. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and in other jurisdictions around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments would create a more reliable and smarter grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio, as well as create significant jobs. 
In addition, we believe these investments will position Missouri to keep pace with the evolving electric grid and meet its customers rising energy needs and expectations. We believe the electric system will continue to evolve to a more integrated grid for central and distributed generation, transmission and distribution systems as well as customers and businesses with smart meters, clients and equipment all working together to continuously, instantaneously and reliably, maintain the balance between resources and demand. Benefits from such a system must be enabled by investments to support a more sophisticated and resilient transmission and distribution infrastructure. These investments must also be enabled by modernized energy policy. 
With these benefits in mind, in late September, Ameren Missouri filed with the Missouri PSC a detailed plan for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022, with additional projects of more than $1 billion that could be accelerated over this period, should they be deemed appropriate when taking into consideration customer rate impact. Further, we indicated that a total of more than $4 billion potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period has been identified. In that same filing, we outlined several energy policy alternatives that would enable these important investments, which will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers and the state of Missouri.
On October 17, the Missouri PSC staff issued its report regarding proposed improvements to the state's electric utility regulation. The staff indicated it was not opposed to several approaches for supporting targeted investments, which would continue to include strong PSC oversight. These approaches include certain trackers and riders, plant-in-service accounting, interim rate, largely forecast test years and an electric infrastructure system replacement surcharge. We appreciate the staffs consideration of several tools used in other states to support investment for the benefit of customers and the state. This report is an important step, and we look forward to continued discussion with all stakeholders.
Turning to the Senate Interim Committee efforts. In August and October, the committee held hearings, which provided a forum for Missouri's stakeholders and outside experts to provide their perspectives in the state's current utility regulation and how it might be modernized to support increased investment. Those hearings have been very informative and have provided another opportunity to discuss this important energy policy issue with key stakeholders outside of the very busy legislative session. As we continue to engage with stakeholders, I am more convinced than ever that improvements in Missouri's regulatory framework were in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri. We expect reports of the Missouri PSC in the Senate Interim Committee to be issued no later than December 1 and December 31, respectively.
In the meantime, we are also taking other steps to better position Missouri for the future. In particular, we have proposed several pilot programs in Missouri to PSC. The pilot program offering customers subscription-based solar power has been approved by the Missouri PSC, our proposed pilot programs for building solar facilities in partnership with large customers and for building electric vehicle charging stations along our corridor in the state are pending before the commission.
I will now move to Page 8 and our long-term rate base growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 through 2020 period. Our execution of this plan remains on track. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital of FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas distribution services, as these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and the investments provided significant long-term benefits to our customer.
Turning now to Page 9. Here, you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the grid needs to be modernized to meet our customers future energy needs and expectations. As you can see on the right side of this page, the allocation of capital to transmission and electric and gas distribution is expected to grow these businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by year-end 2020. Further, we are focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. Consequently, our investment in coal and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to 15% of rate base by year-end 2020. This transition will continue beyond 2020 with the retirement of our Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next integrated resource plan, which will be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment, and of course, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 10, in addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, as just mentioned, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2020. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and gas distribution systems in the state. This includes investments to upgrade and replace gas transmission pipeline, underground storage facility and distribution infrastructure to comply with expected new federal safety regulations. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet NERC requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. We also plan to pursue potential local and regional transmission opportunities to upgrade the grids to maintain system voltages and reliability as generating plants close in response to power market economics and the Clean Power Plan [indiscernible].
Finally, a transmission development team continues to pursue regional electric transmission projects focusing on the MISO, PJM and Southwest Power Pool region. For Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investments. We will continue to provide safe and adequate service, which includes replacing aging transmission and distribution infrastructure when needed. We will also make investments needed to comply with the Clean Power Plan. And as discussed earlier, there are also numerous opportunities for incremental investments in Missouri should the regulatory framework improve. These opportunities include investments in smart meter, replacement of aging substations and other equipment, modernizing the underground grid and transmission as well as adding renewables. Of course, across our entire system, we will also make important investments in information technology and cybersecurity. The bottom line is that, we believe, the investment opportunities that I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders in the decade ahead.
Turning now to Page 11. Let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking and in areas that provide long-term value to our customers. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend 3.5% to $0.44 per share, reflecting confidence in our outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. This increase resulted in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and other business condition.
Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently yielding approximately 3.6%, results in a superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we are committed to executing our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."
373264,406994338,1074301,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we recorded third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight",1872,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we recorded third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.11 per share year-over-year increase. Warmer temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.11 per share versus 2015 and $0.10 per share versus normal condition as we experienced the fourth hottest third quarter, including the hottest September since 1970. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.09 per share, including changes in allowed returns on equity compared to the year-ago period.
With regard to returns on equity, third quarter 2016 result from our FERC-regulated transmission businesses benefited from a temporarily higher ROE as compared to the prior period, reflecting the expiration in May of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC's order in the first complaint case then lowered the ROE in late September to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder.
Turning to our Illinois electric distribution business. Third quarter results reflected a reduced ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.29% compared to 8.67% for the year-ago period. The third quarter 2016 allowed ROE was based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.49% for the full year 2016. Factors that had an unfavorable effect on third quarter earnings comparisons included the loss of sales to the New Madrid smelter and increased Ameren Missouri depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share, respectively. And finally, the year-over-year third quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan for earnings neutral has the carryover effect of lower sales resulting from this plan were offset by recognition of $19 million or $0.05 per share for a portion of the performance incentive award associated with energy efficiency results achieved over the 2013 through 2015 period. 
In total, based on a stipulation and agreement approved by the Missouri PSC earlier this week, Ameren Missouri will recognize $28 million or $0.07 per share of total incentive award in 2016, including the previously mentioned $0.05 per share in the third quarter and an additional $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. We are pleased that we're able to reach agreement with the PSC staff and the Office of Public Counsel on these incentive awards, and believe this outcome reflects the tremendous success of the 2013 through 2015 MEEIA program was for our customer.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date compared to the prior year. Overall, we experienced trends similar to those discussed on our last 2 quarterly calls, although we did see some improvement in the third quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers, on a combined basis, were up slightly year-to-date as underlying growth and the lead days sales benefit more than offset energy efficiency impact. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 2% year-to-date, primarily reflecting lower sales to several low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steel making, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we have seen improvement in the second and third quarters as industrial sales levels appeared to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down approximately 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the Noranda smelter.
Turning to Page 14 of our presentation, I would like to move from this discussion of sales to a discussion of our earnings guidance for the year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, and our original February guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The increased guidance from February reflects strong year-to-date results, including the first quarter $0.09 per share tax benefit associated with share-based compensation, an estimated $0.11 per share weather benefit compared to normal, driven by warmer summer temperatures as well as disciplined cost management. 
Factors that are expected to have a favorable effect on year-over-year fourth quarter result included an assumed return to normal temperatures compared to much milder than normal temperatures in last year's fourth quarter, continued increased electric transmission and distribution infrastructure investment by ATXI and Ameren Illinois, as well as higher Illinois natural gas distribution rates  in 2016. Factors that are expected to have an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons include carryover impacts of Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan, with the recognition of the majority of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency performance incentive award in the third quarter, we revised the expected unfavorable year-over-year fourth quarter impact of the 2015 plan to $0.08 per share from our prior estimate of $0.03 per share. Further, we expect the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings comparison to be unfavorably affected by lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and regulatory lag related to increased Missouri depreciation and transmission expenses.
Moving to Page 15. Here we highlight select pending regulatory matter. Starting with Missouri, in our pending electric rate review, we requested a $206 million annual revenue increase that is primarily driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales largely driven by the suspension of operation at the New Madrid smelter, and recover increased MISO transmission charges. To address the last item, we have also requested the implementation of our new MISO transmission tracker in the rate review. We expect the Missouri PSC to complete their review by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May.
Moving on, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing with the ICC in April of this year under Illinois' formula ratemaking framework. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement, consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investment that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end this year.
Last week, an ALJ proposed order recommended a $14 million net revenue requirement decrease, in line with our filing. This recommendation is further evidence of the consistent, constructive treatment Ameren Illinois is receiving under the state electric formula ratemaking framework. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. Finally, in the first of the 2 complaint cases that sought to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, the FERC issued its order in September adopting a 10.32% base ROE in line with the ALJ's recommendation. In the second case, the FERC ALJ has recommended a 9.7% base ROE and a FERC order is expected in the second quarter of next year. As a result of these cases, we have accrued a reserve for estimated refund of $61 million as of September 30, 2016, that is consistent with the FERC's order in the first case and the ALJs recommendation in the second case. In addition to the MISO base ROE, Ameren Illinois and ATXI received a FERC-approved ROE adder of up to 50 basis points, effective in January 2015 for their participation in MISO.
Moving now to Page 16. We plan to provide 2017 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2016 year-to-date financial result and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATX projects made under formula forward-looking ratemaking. However, we expect these earnings to be unfavorably impacted by a projected lower weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to 2016. For Ameren Illinois electric distribution service, we anticipate increased earnings in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made there under Illinois' formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average of 2017 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rate on a timely basis under the state gas infrastructure rider.
For Missouri, the 2017 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected by increased Missouri electric service rate to be implemented as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to reflect recovery of and a return on new infrastructure investment as well as more recent sales and cost levels. The incorporation of more recent sales levels is expected to remove the negative earnings effect from lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison as we now expect an estimated $0.03 per share negative impact from the suspension of operation in the first 5 months of 2017. We expect Ameren Missouri's 2017 result to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses, particularly in the first 5 months of the year before new rate become effective. 
Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the $0.07 per share energy efficiency performance incentive award to be recognized in 2016, which I previously discussed. And a return to  normal weather in 2017 would reduce combined Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2016, assuming, of course, normal weather in the last quarter of this year. Finally, we expect expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the fall of 2017 to be comparable to those experienced in the spring outage of this year.  Moving then to parent and other. We expect lower tax benefit associated with share-based compensation next year compared to this year.
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We continue to successfully execute our strategy and have delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date result. These results allowed us to increase our 2016 earnings guidance range to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. On our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, using our then adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63 as a base. This earnings growth outlook was driven by 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions made for the benefit of customers. Our recently increased dividend provides investors with the yield of approximately 3.6%, which is above average compared to fully rate-regulated utility peers. When you combine our strong earnings growth outlook with this dividend, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your question."

Today, we announced third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared to earnings of $1.41 per share in last year's third quarter. This earnings increase reflected higher electric sales to residential and commercial customers, driven by warmer summer temperatures. The earnings comparison also benefited from increased FERC-regulated transmission in Illinois electric distribution infrastructure investments made under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks in order to better serve our customers. These favorable items were partially offset by lower electric sales to the New Madrid aluminum smelter, historically, Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Earlier this year, operations at the smelter were suspended and it remains shut down.
Overall, our third quarter results were strong as our team continued to successfully execute our strategy. And I am pleased to report that, for the second time this year, we have raised our 2016 earnings guidance. Our new guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75 per share, up from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share reflecting the strong year-to-date results.
Turning to Page 5, here we reiterate our strategic plan. We continue to successfully execute this strategy and remain convinced it will deliver superior long-term value to both our customers and shareholders. I would like to take a few moments and highlight some of our year-to-date accomplishments towards this end. To begin, we continue to strategically allocate significant amounts of capital to those businesses whose investments are supported by regulatory frameworks that provide fair, predictable and timely cost recovery and also deliver long-term benefits to our customers. This capital allocation is illustrated in the graphic on the right side of this page.
As you can see, year-to-date, we've invested almost $1 billion of capital in jurisdictions with these supportive regulatory frameworks. This represented almost 2/3 of our year-to-date 2016 capital spending and included approximately $510 million of investment in FERC-regulated transmission projects. The largest of these remains ATXI's $1.4 billion Illinois Rivers transmission project. 4 of these projects 9-line segments, including 2 river crossings, have been energized. And work on the other segments and the third river crossing is well underway. Further, 8 of the projects 10 substations are now in service, with the remaining 2 under construction. Regarding ATXI's $150 million Spoon River project in the Northwestern Illinois, construction is being completed on its 2 substations. In addition, we are acquiring the balance of needed right-of-way and have just begun clearing land on certain sections of the project, with significant line construction expected to begin in January.
As for the $225 million Mark Twain project in Northeast Missouri, we recently initiated court proceedings in order to obtain a sense of road crosses from the 5 counties where the line is planned to be constructed. When completed, these 3 MISO multi-value projects will deliver significant customer and community benefits such as improved reliability and access to cleaner energy, including wind power from the Western and Northern parts of MISO region, including Northeast Missouri. In addition, these projects are creating jobs. We also continue to make significant investments in Ameren Illinois transmission system that will result in a smarter and more reliable energy grid.
Turning to Page 6 of our presentation, let me update you on the execution of our strategic plans in Ameren Illinois. We invested approximately $480 million in Illinois electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure projects during the first 9 months of this year. These included investments made under the company's Modernization Action Plan, which was enabled by the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. In September, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' request to expand the installation of smart electric meters from 62% to 100% of customers. This approval is a testament to the smart meter benefits achieved so far and takes advantage of the infrastructure, processes and teams already in place to efficiently and effectively deploy additional new meters.
As you see, approval of this request also supports increasing the installation of smart gas meter modules from 56% to 100% of customers. The approximately $150 million incremental investment to expand deployment of electric and gas smart meters to all of our Illinois customers was included in the multiyear capital spending plan we shared with you earlier this year. As you can see on the right side of this page, Ameren Illinois plans to install approximately 1.25 million advanced electric meters and upgrade approximately 830,000 gas meter modules by the end of 2019. Through September of this year, approximately 352,000 electric and 178,000 gas meters have been installed. Since we began to deploy advanced metering technology, Ameren Illinois has reduced estimated meter reads by over 440,000 and eliminated the need for nearly 100,000 service visits.  
Lastly, this year, Ameren Illinois launched a peak time rewards program, allowing customers with new smart meters to manage usage during peak summer days. More than 8,000 participated, saving an estimated 47,000 kilowatt hours. Clearly, these Smart Grid investments are saving Ameren Illinois customers money by allowing them to better manage power usage when they experience fewer and shorter power outages. In fact, the frequency and duration of Ameren Illinois' power outages have been reduced by averages of 17% and 18%, respectively, from the baseline set by the state's Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. As a result, Ameren Illinois' electric distribution initiatives remain on track to meet or exceed investment, liability and smart meter goals established in this act.
In addition, Ameren Illinois' enhanced framework for natural gas distribution is driving greater levels of investment in energy infrastructure. These natural gas distribution infrastructure projects are also improving the safety and reliability of that system. It is clear that modernized energy policies in Illinois are driving significant incremental investments in its electric and natural gas energy infrastructure. Together, these investments are not only delivering meaningful long-term benefits to our customers at affordable rates, but they have also created a significant number of new jobs in the state of Illinois.
Turning to Page 7 of our presentation, let me provide a business update on Missouri. In July, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for a $206 million increase in annual electric service revenue to begin to recover and earn a return on energy infrastructure investments that are not included in rates and to reflect reduced sales due to the suspension of operations at the New Madrid smelter, among other things. Marty will discuss our filing in more detail in a moment. We expect the Missouri PSC to issue a decision in this rate review in late April, with new rates expected to be effective in late May of next year.
Shifting now to efforts to enhance Missouri's regulatory framework. 2 separate efforts were initiated by the state to evaluate the need for regulatory reform to support investment in Missouri's energy infrastructure. One by the Missouri PSC and the other by a Senate Interim Committee. We appreciate the time and effort being undertaken to study this important issue. I will start by providing an update on the Missouri PSC effort. 
To begin, over the last several months, the Missouri PSC requested and received extensive comments from stakeholders and held a workshop to assist in their consideration of policies to improve the way it regulates electric utilities. In this workshop, and later on filings with the PSC, Ameren Missouri highlighted the issues associated with the Missouri's aging energy infrastructure as well as the fact that the existing regulatory framework does not adequately support investment. 
Our filings also cited several approaches that are being successfully utilized around the country to address the issues that Missouri now faces. Including performance-based formulaic ratemaking and forward test years as well as trackers and riders. Importantly, we highlighted the significant long-term customer and statewide benefits that would be realized by changes in energy policies that will support incremental energy infrastructure investment. Consistent with the benefits we have seen in Illinois and in other jurisdictions around the country, modernized policies to support energy infrastructure investments would create a more reliable and smarter grid, facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more diverse energy portfolio, as well as create significant jobs. 
In addition, we believe these investments will position Missouri to keep pace with the evolving electric grid and meet its customers rising energy needs and expectations. We believe the electric system will continue to evolve to a more integrated grid for central and distributed generation, transmission and distribution systems as well as customers and businesses with smart meters, clients and equipment all working together to continuously, instantaneously and reliably, maintain the balance between resources and demand. Benefits from such a system must be enabled by investments to support a more sophisticated and resilient transmission and distribution infrastructure. These investments must also be enabled by modernized energy policy. 
With these benefits in mind, in late September, Ameren Missouri filed with the Missouri PSC a detailed plan for potential incremental infrastructure investments of $1 billion over a 5-year period ending in 2022, with additional projects of more than $1 billion that could be accelerated over this period, should they be deemed appropriate when taking into consideration customer rate impact. Further, we indicated that a total of more than $4 billion potential incremental infrastructure investments over a 10-year period has been identified. In that same filing, we outlined several energy policy alternatives that would enable these important investments, which will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers and the state of Missouri.
On October 17, the Missouri PSC staff issued its report regarding proposed improvements to the state's electric utility regulation. The staff indicated it was not opposed to several approaches for supporting targeted investments, which would continue to include strong PSC oversight. These approaches include certain trackers and riders, plant-in-service accounting, interim rate, largely forecast test years and an electric infrastructure system replacement surcharge. We appreciate the staffs consideration of several tools used in other states to support investment for the benefit of customers and the state. This report is an important step, and we look forward to continued discussion with all stakeholders.
Turning to the Senate Interim Committee efforts. In August and October, the committee held hearings, which provided a forum for Missouri's stakeholders and outside experts to provide their perspectives in the state's current utility regulation and how it might be modernized to support increased investment. Those hearings have been very informative and have provided another opportunity to discuss this important energy policy issue with key stakeholders outside of the very busy legislative session. As we continue to engage with stakeholders, I am more convinced than ever that improvements in Missouri's regulatory framework were in the best long-term interest of our customers and the entire state of Missouri. We expect reports of the Missouri PSC in the Senate Interim Committee to be issued no later than December 1 and December 31, respectively.
In the meantime, we are also taking other steps to better position Missouri for the future. In particular, we have proposed several pilot programs in Missouri to PSC. The pilot program offering customers subscription-based solar power has been approved by the Missouri PSC, our proposed pilot programs for building solar facilities in partnership with large customers and for building electric vehicle charging stations along our corridor in the state are pending before the commission.
I will now move to Page 8 and our long-term rate base growth outlook. In February of this year, we outlined our plan to grow rate base at a solid 6.5% compound annual rate over the 2015 through 2020 period. Our execution of this plan remains on track. As the graphics on this page illustrate and in line with our strategic plan, this growth is being driven by the allocation of significant amounts of capital of FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois electric and natural gas distribution services, as these jurisdictions provide constructive regulatory frameworks and the investments provided significant long-term benefits to our customer.
Turning now to Page 9. Here, you can see that our strategic and disciplined allocation of capital is also being driven by our view that the grid needs to be modernized to meet our customers future energy needs and expectations. As you can see on the right side of this page, the allocation of capital to transmission and electric and gas distribution is expected to grow these businesses to nearly 3/4 of our rate base by year-end 2020. Further, we are focused on transitioning our generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion. Consequently, our investment in coal and gas-fired generation is expected to decline to 15% of rate base by year-end 2020. This transition will continue beyond 2020 with the retirement of our Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022. In addition, Ameren Missouri is developing its next integrated resource plan, which will be filed with the Missouri PSC in October 2017. In this plan, we will continue to appropriately balance our responsibilities to our customers and communities, the environment, and of course, our shareholders.
Turning now to Page 10, in addition to the progress we are making in executing our plans for the current 5-year period, as just mentioned, we are focused on creating and capitalizing on additional opportunities beyond 2020. With the support of constructive Illinois ratemaking, we expect to continue making significant investments to enhance the reliability and safety of our electric and gas distribution systems in the state. This includes investments to upgrade and replace gas transmission pipeline, underground storage facility and distribution infrastructure to comply with expected new federal safety regulations. Further, we expect to continue to invest in local electric transmission projects to maintain and enhance reliability, including projects to meet NERC requirements, replace aging infrastructure and modernize the grid. We also plan to pursue potential local and regional transmission opportunities to upgrade the grids to maintain system voltages and reliability as generating plants close in response to power market economics and the Clean Power Plan [indiscernible].
Finally, a transmission development team continues to pursue regional electric transmission projects focusing on the MISO, PJM and Southwest Power Pool region. For Missouri, we have numerous opportunities for additional investments. We will continue to provide safe and adequate service, which includes replacing aging transmission and distribution infrastructure when needed. We will also make investments needed to comply with the Clean Power Plan. And as discussed earlier, there are also numerous opportunities for incremental investments in Missouri should the regulatory framework improve. These opportunities include investments in smart meter, replacement of aging substations and other equipment, modernizing the underground grid and transmission as well as adding renewables. Of course, across our entire system, we will also make important investments in information technology and cybersecurity. The bottom line is that, we believe, the investment opportunities that I just described across all of our companies have the potential to provide significant benefits to our customers and shareholders in the decade ahead.
Turning now to Page 11. Let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we are successfully executing our strategy and delivering strong earnings results. Looking forward, we have a superior long-term earnings growth outlook driven by above peer average rate base growth that is focused on investments in jurisdictions with constructive ratemaking and in areas that provide long-term value to our customers. I am pleased to note that last month, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend 3.5% to $0.44 per share, reflecting confidence in our outlook for our businesses and our long-term strategy. This increase resulted in an annualized equivalent rate of $1.76 per share. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings. Of course, future dividend increases will be based on consideration of, among other things, earnings growth, cash flows and other business condition.
Our strong earnings growth profile, combined with our solid dividend, currently yielding approximately 3.6%, results in a superior total return opportunity for our shareholders. 
To summarize, we are committed to executing our strategy, and I remain firmly convinced that doing so will deliver superior value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Marty."

Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we recorded third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight",1872,"Thanks, Warner. Good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 13 of our presentation, as Warner mentioned, we recorded third quarter 2016 earnings of $1.52 per share compared with earnings of $1.41 per share for last year's third quarter. Here we highlight factors that drove the $0.11 per share year-over-year increase. Warmer temperatures increased earnings by an estimated $0.11 per share versus 2015 and $0.10 per share versus normal condition as we experienced the fourth hottest third quarter, including the hottest September since 1970. Increased investments in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure in our ATXI and Ameren Illinois businesses lifted earnings by $0.09 per share, including changes in allowed returns on equity compared to the year-ago period.
With regard to returns on equity, third quarter 2016 result from our FERC-regulated transmission businesses benefited from a temporarily higher ROE as compared to the prior period, reflecting the expiration in May of the 15-month refund period for the second MISO ROE complaint case. The FERC's order in the first complaint case then lowered the ROE in late September to 10.82%, including our 50 basis point adder.
Turning to our Illinois electric distribution business. Third quarter results reflected a reduced ROE under formulaic ratemaking of 8.29% compared to 8.67% for the year-ago period. The third quarter 2016 allowed ROE was based on an assumed average 30-year treasury rate of 2.49% for the full year 2016. Factors that had an unfavorable effect on third quarter earnings comparisons included the loss of sales to the New Madrid smelter and increased Ameren Missouri depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share, respectively. And finally, the year-over-year third quarter impacts of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan for earnings neutral has the carryover effect of lower sales resulting from this plan were offset by recognition of $19 million or $0.05 per share for a portion of the performance incentive award associated with energy efficiency results achieved over the 2013 through 2015 period. 
In total, based on a stipulation and agreement approved by the Missouri PSC earlier this week, Ameren Missouri will recognize $28 million or $0.07 per share of total incentive award in 2016, including the previously mentioned $0.05 per share in the third quarter and an additional $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. We are pleased that we're able to reach agreement with the PSC staff and the Office of Public Counsel on these incentive awards, and believe this outcome reflects the tremendous success of the 2013 through 2015 MEEIA program was for our customer.
Before moving on, let me briefly cover electric sales trends year-to-date compared to the prior year. Overall, we experienced trends similar to those discussed on our last 2 quarterly calls, although we did see some improvement in the third quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois and Missouri residential and commercial customers, on a combined basis, were up slightly year-to-date as underlying growth and the lead days sales benefit more than offset energy efficiency impact. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois industrial customers decreased approximately 2% year-to-date, primarily reflecting lower sales to several low-margin Illinois customers, including those in steel making, heavy equipment manufacturing, mining and energy. However, we have seen improvement in the second and third quarters as industrial sales levels appeared to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Finally, kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers were down approximately 1/2 of 1%, excluding lower sales to the Noranda smelter.
Turning to Page 14 of our presentation, I would like to move from this discussion of sales to a discussion of our earnings guidance for the year. As Warner stated, we now expect 2016 diluted earnings to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, an increase from our prior range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, and our original February guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The increased guidance from February reflects strong year-to-date results, including the first quarter $0.09 per share tax benefit associated with share-based compensation, an estimated $0.11 per share weather benefit compared to normal, driven by warmer summer temperatures as well as disciplined cost management. 
Factors that are expected to have a favorable effect on year-over-year fourth quarter result included an assumed return to normal temperatures compared to much milder than normal temperatures in last year's fourth quarter, continued increased electric transmission and distribution infrastructure investment by ATXI and Ameren Illinois, as well as higher Illinois natural gas distribution rates  in 2016. Factors that are expected to have an unfavorable effect on the earnings comparisons include carryover impacts of Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency plan, with the recognition of the majority of Ameren Missouri's 2015 energy efficiency performance incentive award in the third quarter, we revised the expected unfavorable year-over-year fourth quarter impact of the 2015 plan to $0.08 per share from our prior estimate of $0.03 per share. Further, we expect the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings comparison to be unfavorably affected by lower sales to the New Madrid smelter and regulatory lag related to increased Missouri depreciation and transmission expenses.
Moving to Page 15. Here we highlight select pending regulatory matter. Starting with Missouri, in our pending electric rate review, we requested a $206 million annual revenue increase that is primarily driven by our need to recover and earn a return on important new infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, adjust rates to reflect reduced customer sales largely driven by the suspension of operation at the New Madrid smelter, and recover increased MISO transmission charges. To address the last item, we have also requested the implementation of our new MISO transmission tracker in the rate review. We expect the Missouri PSC to complete their review by late April of next year, with new rates expected to be effective in late May.
Moving on, Ameren Illinois made its required annual electric distribution rate update filing with the ICC in April of this year under Illinois' formula ratemaking framework. Our filing calls for a $14 million decrease in the net annual electric revenue requirement, consisting of an increase reflecting 2015 actual cost and expected 2016 infrastructure investment that is more than offset by a decrease reflecting completion of the recovery of 2014 actual cost by the end this year.
Last week, an ALJ proposed order recommended a $14 million net revenue requirement decrease, in line with our filing. This recommendation is further evidence of the consistent, constructive treatment Ameren Illinois is receiving under the state electric formula ratemaking framework. An ICC decision is expected in December of this year with new rates effective early next year. Finally, in the first of the 2 complaint cases that sought to reduce the base allowed ROE for MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Illinois and ATXI, the FERC issued its order in September adopting a 10.32% base ROE in line with the ALJ's recommendation. In the second case, the FERC ALJ has recommended a 9.7% base ROE and a FERC order is expected in the second quarter of next year. As a result of these cases, we have accrued a reserve for estimated refund of $61 million as of September 30, 2016, that is consistent with the FERC's order in the first case and the ALJs recommendation in the second case. In addition to the MISO base ROE, Ameren Illinois and ATXI received a FERC-approved ROE adder of up to 50 basis points, effective in January 2015 for their participation in MISO.
Moving now to Page 16. We plan to provide 2017 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February of next year. However, using our 2016 year-to-date financial result and guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with the first item listed, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATX projects made under formula forward-looking ratemaking. However, we expect these earnings to be unfavorably impacted by a projected lower weighted average allowed ROE in 2017 compared to 2016. For Ameren Illinois electric distribution service, we anticipate increased earnings in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting additional infrastructure investments made there under Illinois' formula ratemaking. The allowed ROE will be, of course, the average of 2017 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. In addition, Ameren Illinois' gas distribution earnings are expected to benefit from qualified investments that are included in rate on a timely basis under the state gas infrastructure rider.
For Missouri, the 2017 earnings comparison is expected to be favorably affected by increased Missouri electric service rate to be implemented as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to reflect recovery of and a return on new infrastructure investment as well as more recent sales and cost levels. The incorporation of more recent sales levels is expected to remove the negative earnings effect from lower sales to the New Madrid smelter, adding an estimated $0.12 per share to the year-over-year earnings comparison as we now expect an estimated $0.03 per share negative impact from the suspension of operation in the first 5 months of 2017. We expect Ameren Missouri's 2017 result to also reflect regulatory lag associated with increased depreciation, transmission and property tax expenses, particularly in the first 5 months of the year before new rate become effective. 
Further, Ameren Missouri's electric service earnings will be negatively affected by the absence in 2017 of the $0.07 per share energy efficiency performance incentive award to be recognized in 2016, which I previously discussed. And a return to  normal weather in 2017 would reduce combined Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2016, assuming, of course, normal weather in the last quarter of this year. Finally, we expect expenses associated with the Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage scheduled for the fall of 2017 to be comparable to those experienced in the spring outage of this year.  Moving then to parent and other. We expect lower tax benefit associated with share-based compensation next year compared to this year.
Turning to Page 17, I will summarize. We continue to successfully execute our strategy and have delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date result. These results allowed us to increase our 2016 earnings guidance range to $2.65 to $2.75 per share. On our February call, we stated that we expected earnings per share to grow at a strong 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, using our then adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63 as a base. This earnings growth outlook was driven by 6.5% compound annual rate base growth over the 2015 through 2020 period based on a mix of needed transmission, distribution and generation investments across multiple regulatory jurisdictions made for the benefit of customers. Our recently increased dividend provides investors with the yield of approximately 3.6%, which is above average compared to fully rate-regulated utility peers. When you combine our strong earnings growth outlook with this dividend, we believe our common stock provides very attractive total return potential for investors.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your question."
