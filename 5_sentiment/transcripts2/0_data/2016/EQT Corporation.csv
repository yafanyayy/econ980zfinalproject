As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.75 per diluted share compared to $3.43 per diluted share in 2014. A high-level story for the year as well as for the fourth",840,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.75 per diluted share compared to $3.43 per diluted share in 2014. A high-level story for the year as well as for the fourth quarter was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. Notably, production volumes were 27% higher than last year, and midstream gathering volumes were up by 28%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EQT earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT for 2015 were all down versus 2014 by any measure although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $964.3 million in '15 compared to $1,424,000,000 in 2014. And I refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details. 
Results in the fourth quarter were similarly down. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss was $0.06 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the fourth quarter of '14. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $233.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Production sales volume was 13% higher than the fourth quarter of '14. We also realized 12% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a negative tax adjustment of $79.5 million to reserve certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards that may not be utilized in a low commodity price environment. This had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the year. Netting up the effects of this NOL carryforward adjustment in the fourth quarter as well as the regulatory asset tax adjustment in the second quarter would have resulted in an effective tax rate for the year of closer to 15%. Although subject to many factors, including commodity prices, transactions, et cetera, we think a range of 10% to 15% is a reasonable effective tax rate range for year 2016 modeling purposes. 
Now moving onto a brief discussion of our results by business segment. I will begin my discussion with the full year results as the explanations for the full year for the most part apply for the fourth quarter as well. 
So starting with EQT Production. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of the 603.1 Bcf equivalent for 2015, again, representing a 27% increase over 2014. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2015 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2015 was our sixth great year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized prices more than offset the increased sales of produced natural gas in our financial results. 
The EQT average realized price was $2.67 per Mcf equivalent for '15, and that was $1.49 or 36% lower per unit than last year. For segment reporting purposes, of that $2.67 realized by EQT Corporation, $1.74 was allocated EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 allocated to EQT Midstream. The majority of the $0.93 is for gathering, which averaged $0.74 per Mcf equivalent for the year. 
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $1,251.6 million, excluding asset impairment charges and onetime drilling costs or 19% higher year-over-year. DD&A, SG&A and LOE were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth although production taxes were lower for the year as a result of lower prices. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, was 25% lower year-over-year as volume increased more than expenses. 
Moving on to the midstream result. Operating income here was up 23% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering and transmission revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Gathering revenues also increased by almost 27% year-over-year as a result of higher gathering volumes in 2015. Total operating expenses at midstream were $318.8 million or $41.2 million higher than 2014, excluding an impairment and the exploration of some right of way options. This increase was consistent with the growth of the midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great rate liquidity position, with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.25 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1 billion 2016 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash on hand. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for an update on the Utica program as well as some thoughts on today's reserve release."

As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review 2 topics: the 2015 reserve report and an update on our Deep Utica program. Starting with the Utica. As you know, we turned in line our first Deep Utica well, the Scots Run591360 in July of 2015.",1049,"Thanks, Phil. As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review 2 topics: the 2015 reserve report and an update on our Deep Utica program. 
Starting with the Utica. As you know, we turned in line our first Deep Utica well, the Scots Run591360 in July of 2015. The well continues to produce at a consistent 30 million cubic feet per well with a steady pressure decline. The well is exceeding our previous forecast, and we now expect this well to flow at 30 million cubic feet a day until mid-April before it begin its production decline. As a result, we revised the range of our EUR estimate to between 5.1 and 5.9 Bcfe per thousand foot of lateral. As a reminder, this well has completed a lateral length of 3,221 feet. And to date, this well has produced 5.8 Bcf. 
Our second well, the padded 593066 was completed the very end of December. This well has a 5,200-foot lateral and was completed with a 29-stage frac job. After initial cleanup and the 24-hour flow test at 43 million cubic feet per day, we shut the well in for an extended reservoir pressure test and to install the permanent production facilities. On January 29, we bought the well online at a choke-restricted rate of 20 million cubic feet per day with a floating casing pressure of 8,700 psi. The initial results from the padded well appear to be in line with other Deep Utica wells in the area and are consistent with our expectations of Utica across our core focus area. 
In addition to the 2 producing wells, we spud another 2 Utica wells. The Big 190 well in Wetzel county, west Virginia has been drilled to TD, and we are now in the process of completing the 35-stage frac job. It has a 6,300-foot lateral and has an expected turn in-line date in late February or early March. 
Our fourth well, the Shipment well in Greene County, Pennsylvania is currently being top set with a planned a length of 7,000 feet. On the cost side for the Utica, we've been able to achieve significant savings on each of our wells and are ahead of our schedule to meet our target of $12.5 million to $14 million per well. Savings have been realized in all phases of the development cycle with the most significant savings coming from improved drilling efficiency. Adjusting for lateral length, the padded well cost $17.3 million, and the Big 190 cost $15.4 million. On a cost per-foot basis, we've successfully lowered our costs from $9,600 per foot for Scotts Run well to $2,800 per foot for Big 190. As a reminder, we have 2 objectives for our 2016 Utica program: one, get the cost per well down to our target range, which we expect to achieve an hour currently drilling shipment well; and two, confirm the productivity of the reservoir within our core Utica focus areas in Southwestern PA and Northern West Virginia. If we can accomplish both objectives, we expect that Utica returns in the core area will be competitive with or better than the core Marcellus, and we will work on a plan to include Utica in our future development planes. We will update you on our progress each quarter. 
Moving on to the reserve report. As you saw in our press release this morning, we announced total proved reserves of 10 TCFE, with 6.3 Tcfe of these reserves associated with wells that have already been developed. This proved developed reserves totaled 30% higher than year-end 2014 and includes 2.1 Tcfe of increases. Within that 2.1 Tcfe increase is 386 Bcfe improved developed reserves from wells that were unproved in 2014 but were ultimately drilled and completed in 2015. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves. 
Also contributing into our increased proved developed reserves is over 300 Bcfe from producing wells that are outperforming our previous forecast. Additionally, we converted 1.5 Tcfe or 25% of our 2014 PUD reserves into the proved developed category. We also cut our 5-year PUD development plan in half, which is consistent with our reduced activity in 2016. Both of these factors contributed to a 37% decrease in PUD reserves. 
Looking at just our Marcellus reserves. The average proved location considering both developed and undeveloped is 700 feet longer and has an EUR that is 1.4 Bcfe greater than the average proved Marcellus location booked in 2014. These statistics demonstrate consistently strong well performance as well as EQT's ability to continue leveraging our acreage position within our core development area, allowing us to drill longer laterals. In fact, our PUD reserve reflect 337 Bcfe of increases that is directly related to lenth extensions of previously booked undeveloped locations. These length extensions not only boost the economics of reserves of previously booked locations but also allow us to book 703 Bcfe of the new PUD locations that were previously too short to be considered economic PUDs. To further offset the effect of low pricing, EQT continue to improve our efficiency and drive development cost lower. The development cost of wells completed in 2015 was $0.83 per Mcfe versus $1.15 per Mcfe for wells completed in 2014. This 27% reduction was driven by longer laterals, drilling and completion efficiency and significant reductions in service cost, particularly on the frac side. 
Our current estimate of total resource potential is 78 Tcfe, which now includes 25 Tcfe attributed to the core of our deep Utica play. Also within that 78 Tcfe of resource potential are our probable and possible reserves. As noted in this morning's release, using SEC's required trailing 12-month pricing methodology resulted in total probable and possible reserves of 14.60 Tcfe. If you look at forward-looking prices, which are more representative of our development assumptions, our probable and possible reserves would total 35 Tcfe. Neither of those probable and possible totals includes any deep Utica well serves as we are relegating that play to other resource potential for now with the exception of the 24 Bcf of proved reserves from our 2 producing wells. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."

This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December as this is our first call since that time. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 billi",1148,"Thank you, Steve. This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December as this is our first call since that time. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 billion in cash and with nothing drawn in our $1.5 billion unsecured revolver. In that context and given that we have other potential sources of cash such as in other midstream drop, we were comfortable with a CapEx estimate that was moderately higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2016. However, we do not have any plans to significantly erode that strong liquidity position as we believe that our current conservative financial approach is appropriate for today's environment. The rest of my remarks will elaborate on that view. 
First, we're have been looking to add to our core acreage position for the past year but have not yet transacted as sellers have not fully accepted the valuation impact of low commodity prices. Ironically, even sellers expectations did begin coming more into line with current market realities, we narrowed our geographic focus to possibilities that have real consolidation benefits within the core of the core as we have referred to it. As the market continues to evolve, it seems to us reasonably likely that there will be some actual transactions in the first half of 2016. However, given our tighter focus as well as some other attributes to the current market, smaller asset transactions seem more likely than larger or whole company deals. 
Speaking of the market, let's shift to our view of the natural gas supply-demand market. You may recall that I do consider rig count to be a reasonable, if rough, leading indicator of natural gas production though some adjustments need to be made to glean any meaning from the published data. For instance, there's a longer lead time between spuds and marketable production than there used to be. Rigs are more efficient than they used to be, especially because of longer laterals and also improved completion techniques, and more natural gas production comes from drilling that the data associates with crude oil-focused activity. As an example of the latter issue that is associated with gas, we're using the published Baker Hughes data, we believe it's best to look at gas equivalent rig count. And admittedly, adjustment to try to account for this associated gas involves assuming that each oil rig behaves more as if it's 3/4 oil and 1/4 gas, but the gas equivalent rig count equals gas-directed rigs plus 0.25x oil-directed rigs. The gas equivalent rig count calculated that way was essentially flat at 700 to 800 from mid-2012 through the end of 2014, so for about 2.5 years. The gas equivalent rig count then decline by about 45% by the spring of 2015, at which point it totaled about 380 until last summer and then again declined gradually by another 10% or so. Then starting in late autumn, the gas equivalent rig count declined an additional 25-plus percent, reaching 246 last week. I recognize that only 121 of those are natural gas that exist in the side. That 121 compares to a high in Pennsylvania alone of about 117 rigs not that many years ago. So this 246  of nearly 2/3 below the last rig count of 2014 and 35% lower than it was just in August of last year. This sharp downturn in activity suggest lower future natural gas production. The question in my opinion is, when. That is, how long is that lag? At EQT, where we drill multi-well pads and long lateral wells, the lag from wells spud to turn in line or tail is 9 to 12 months. Other drillers may have some shorter or longer lags, but they all have material lags. The existence of so-called ducks, that is drilled but uncompleted wells, obviously lengthens the time lag between spud and till. Also, improved efficiencies can mean that one rig today is equivalent to 1-plus rigs of a year ago, but this is only true for some efficiencies such as longer laterals. Efficiencies such as reduced cost spacing, which also tend to accelerate production, can affect the rate volume relationship somewhat over time but mainly improve economics and, therefore, reduce the economic clearing price at which a supply equals demand. My point is to try to predict the exact timing at a production decline, but rather that this decline will occur and it is best if we position ourselves to quickly respond to a higher gas price when the time is appropriate. We believe that a strong balance sheet does this. Based on my expectations of declining supply, I am reasonably bullish on natural gas prices once we have worked off with the current inventory surplus as the current activity level is insufficient to meet demand over time. That said, increased efficiencies and a tighter focus on the core of the core have certainly decreased of the clearing price for natural gas perhaps to the mid-$3 per Mcf range down from our previous expectations of around $4. I do expect that the price will go past that clearing price to the upside eventually as we have seen in the past as the lags that have delayed the production decline emanating from reduced activity will also delay an increase in supply from a future increase activity. Given the industry leaning cost structure of our core Marcellus acreage and potentially the Utica, EQT can make excellent returns at mid-$3 gas. Still, just as we think it is important to be well positioned when the market overshoots to the downside, we will want to be similarly well positioned when the market eventually overshoots to the high side even though that high side overshoot one of our price as nearly as high as they were even a future years ago. 
In times of financial stress for our industry, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year and into next year from a commodity price perspective, we believe that having a strong balance sheet and available cash will put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. This is certainly true if my macro thesis is correct. However, if the alternative theses are prices that are much lower from much longer is correct, having a strong balance sheet and available cash will also put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. From what we can see, there's no reasonably likely thesis under which our shareholders would be well served by us surrendering those advantages. 
So in summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares, and we look forward to continuing to execute in our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

And with the cost that we've already achieved, the economics of those types of locations will be superior to how probably any of the Marcellus opportunities that we have. But we need to define where those the areas are, how big they are, how repeatable they are.

I'm becoming much more optimistic that we will be ultimately at the bottom part of that range rather than the top part. It's just a little early for us to revise that range. We wanted to get in it for a well or 2 before we start updating it. But I think our confidence in the lower part of the range goes up everyday. There are still quite a few areas for improvement, and that's, I guess, that's why I'm so optimistic. We're going to be within that range and identifying numerous opportunities for future improvements. So we'll keep you up-to-date on how we're doing."

So that was our primary objective, but I think we were almost there. We can't quite declare victory yet, but we are getting very, very close. The second objective was to understand of the productivity and the extent within the core of that productivity of the Utica, and that's why we have to drill a 5- to 10-well program this year and get various data appoints. And as we all know, early in new plays, there is always a lot of improvement even on the completion side. You have to get up the learning curve. So we'll make some mistakes. We'll have some -- obviously, we'll have some fantastic wells. We'll probably have some underperforming wells as we experiment with different techniques.

In this case, you probably particularly say it hinges on some of the Utica even though that's not many Utica wells. But generally speaking, I think it has to be for any of the companies that you're looking at that when you see lower capital expenditure in these kind of lags that when you look at another 9 to 12 months, you're going to be seen a reduction in the growth rate. I think there's going to be folks like us where, I'd say, you'll see that real reduction in the growth rate. And I think probably a great untalked about elephant in the room, as it were, is the companies where they had a sharp reduction in capital expenditures and their growth rates going to have parentheses on it in 2017. And frankly, I think they'll have a psychologically beneficial effect on the natural gas price market, but that's still within the context of the clearing price that's a lot lower than what we would've thought maybe a couple of years back.

A high-level story for the year as well as for the fourth",834,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.75 per diluted share compared to $3.43 per diluted share in 2014. A high-level story for the year as well as for the fourth quarter was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. Notably, production volumes were 27% higher than last year, and midstream gathering volumes were up by 28%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EQT earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT for 2015 were all down versus 2014 by any measure, although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $964.3 million in '15 compared to $1,424,000,000 in 2014. And I refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details. 
Results in the fourth quarter were similarly down. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss was $0.06 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the fourth quarter of '14. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $233.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Production sales volume was 13% higher than the fourth quarter of '14. We also realized 12% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a negative tax adjustment of $79.5 million to reserve certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards that may not be utilized in a low commodity price environment. This had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the year. Netting up the effects of this NOL carryforward adjustment in the fourth quarter as well as the regulatory asset tax adjustment in the second quarter would have resulted in an effective tax rate for the year of closer to 15%. Although subject to many factors, including commodity prices, transactions, et cetera, we think a range of 10% to 15% is a reasonable effective tax rate range for year 2016 modeling purposes. 
Now moving onto a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well. 
So starting with EQT Production. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 603.1 Bcf equivalent for 2015, again representing a 27% increase over 2014. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2015 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2015 was our sixth great year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized prices more than offset the increased sales of produced natural gas in our financial results. 
The EQT average realized price was $2.67 per Mcf equivalent for '15, and that was $1.49 or 36% lower per unit than last year. For segment reporting purposes, of that $2.67 realized by EQT Corporation, $1.74 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 allocated to EQT Midstream. The majority of the $0.93 is for gathering, which averaged $0.74 per Mcf equivalent for the year. 
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $1,251,600,000, excluding asset impairment charges and onetime drilling costs or 19% higher year-over-year. DD&A, SG&A and LOE were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the year as a result of lower prices. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, was 25% lower year-over-year, as volume increased more than expenses. 
Moving on to the midstream result. Operating income here was up 23% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering and transmission revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Gathering revenues also increased by almost 27% year-over-year as a result of higher gathered volumes in 2015. Total operating expenses at midstream were $318.8 million or $41.2 million higher than 2014, excluding an impairment and the exploration of some right-of-way options. This increase was consistent with the growth of the midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position, with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.25 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1 billion 2016 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash on hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for an update on the Utica program as well as some thoughts on today's reserve release."

As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review 2 topics: The 2015 reserve report and an update on our deep Utica program. Starting with the Utica. As you know, we turned in line our first deep Utica well, the Scotts Run 591360, in July of 20",1052,"Thanks, Phil. As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review 2 topics: The 2015 reserve report and an update on our deep Utica program. 
Starting with the Utica. As you know, we turned in line our first deep Utica well, the Scotts Run 591360, in July of 2015. The well continues to produce at a consistent 30 million cubic feet per well with a steady pressure decline. The well is exceeding our previous forecast, and we now expect this well to flow at 30 million cubic feet a day until mid-April before it begin its production decline. As a result, we've revised the range of our EUR estimate to between 5.1 and 5.9 Bcfe per thousand foot of lateral. As a reminder, this well has a completed lateral length of 3,221 feet. And to date, this well has produced 5.8 Bcf. 
Our second well, the padded 593066 was completed at the very end of December. This well has a 5,200-foot lateral and was completed with a 29-stage frac job. After initial cleanup and the 24-hour flow test at 43 million cubic feet per day, we shut the well in for an extended reservoir pressure test and to install the permanent production facilities. On January 29, we bought the well online at a choke-restricted rate of 20 million cubic feet per day with a floating casing pressure of 8,700 psi. The initial results from the padded well appeared to be in line with other deep Utica wells in the area and are consistent with our expectations of the Utica across our core focus area. 
In addition to the 2 producing wells, we spud another 2 Utica wells. The Big 190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia has been drilled to TD, and we are now in the process of completing the 35-stage frac job. It has a 6,300-foot lateral and has an expected turn in-line date in late February or early March. 
Our fourth well, the Shipment well in Greene County, Pennsylvania is currently being top set with a planned lateral length of 7,000 feet. On the cost side for the Utica, we've been able to achieve significant savings on each of our wells and are ahead of our schedule to meet our target of $12.5 million to $14 million per well. Savings have been realized in all phases of the development cycle with the most significant savings coming from improved drilling efficiency. Adjusting for lateral length, the padded well cost $17.3 million, and the Big 190 cost $15.4 million. On a cost-per-foot basis, we've successfully lowered our costs from $9,600 per foot for the Scotts Run well to $2,800 per foot for Big 190. As a reminder, we have 2 objectives for our 2016 Utica program: One, get the cost per well down to our target range, which we expect to achieve on our currently drilling shipment well; and two, confirm the productivity of the reservoir within our core Utica focus areas in Southwestern PA and Northern West Virginia. If we can accomplish both objectives, we expect that Utica returns in the core area will be competitive with or better than the core Marcellus, and we will work on a plan to include Utica in our future development plans. We will update you on our progress each quarter. 
Moving on to the reserves report. As you saw in our press release this morning, we announced total proved reserves of 10 Tcfe, with 6.3 Tcfe of these reserves associated with wells that have already been developed. This proved developed reserves totals 30% higher than year-end 2014 and includes 2.1 Tcfe of increases. Within that 2.1 Tcfe increase is 386 Bcfe improved developed reserves from wells that were unproved in 2014, but were ultimately drilled and completed in 2015. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic, even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves. 
Also contributing to our increased proved developed reserves is over 300 Bcfe from producing wells that are outperforming our previous forecast. Additionally, we converted 1.5 Tcfe or 25% of our 2014 PUD reserves into the proved developed category. We also cut our 5-year PUD development plan in half, which is consistent with our reduced activity in 2016. Both of these factors contributed to a 37% decrease in PUD reserves. 
Looking at just our Marcellus reserves. The average proved location considering both developed and undeveloped is 700 feet longer and has an EUR that is 1.4 Bcfe greater than the average proved Marcellus location booked in 2014. These statistics demonstrate consistently strong well performance as well as EQT's ability to continue leveraging our acreage position within our core development area, allowing us to drill longer laterals. In fact, our PUD reserves reflect 337 Bcfe of increases that is directly related to lenth extensions of previously booked undeveloped locations. These length extensions not only boost the economics and reserves of previously booked locations, but also allowed us to book 703 Bcfe of new PUD locations that were previously too short to be considered economic PUDs. To further offset the effect of low pricing, EQT continue to improve our efficiency and drive development cost lower. The development cost of wells completed in 2015 was $0.83 per Mcfe versus $1.15 per Mcfe for wells completed in 2014. This 27% reduction was driven by longer laterals, [indiscernible] drilling and completion efficiency and significant reductions in service costs, particularly on the frac side. 
Our current estimate of total resource potential is 78 Tcfe, which now includes 25 Tcfe attributed to the core of our deep Utica play. Also within that 78 Tcfe of resource potential are our probable and possible reserves. As noted in this morning's release, using the SEC's required trailing 12-month pricing methodology resulted in total probable and possible reserves of 14.6 Tcfe. If you look at forward-looking prices, which are more representative of our development assumptions, our probable and possible reserves would total 35 Tcfe. Neither of those probable and possible totals includes any deep Utica reserves as we are relegating that play to other resource potential for now with the exception of the 24 Bcf of proved reserves from our 2 producing wells. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."

This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December, as this is our first call since that time. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 bill",1146,"Thank you, Steve. This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December, as this is our first call since that time. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 billion in cash and with nothing drawn in our $1.5 billion unsecured revolver. In that context and given that we have other potential sources of cash such as another midstream drop, we were comfortable with the CapEx estimate that was moderately higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2016. However, we do not have any plans to significantly erode that strong liquidity position as we believe that our current conservative financial approach is appropriate for today's environment. The rest of my remarks will elaborate on that view. 
First, we're have been looking to add to our core acreage position for the past year, but have not yet transacted, as sellers have not fully accepted the valuation impact of low commodity prices. Ironically, even if sellers' expectations did begin coming more into line with current market realities, we narrowed our geographic focus to possibilities that have real consolidation benefits within the core of the core as we have referred to it. As the market continues to evolve, it seems to us reasonably likely that there will be some actual transactions in the first half of 2016. However, given our tighter focus as well as some other attributes to the current market, smaller asset transactions seem more likely than larger or whole company deals. 
Speaking of the market, let's shift to our view of the natural gas supply-demand market. You may recall that I do consider rig count to be a reasonable, if rough, leading indicator of natural gas production, though some adjustments need to be made to glean any meaning from the published data. For instance, there's a longer lead time between spuds and marketable production than there used to be. Rigs are more efficient than they used to be, especially because of longer laterals and also improved completion techniques, and more natural gas production comes from drilling that the data associates with crude oil-focused activity. As an example of the latter issue that is associated to gas, when using the published Baker Hughes data, we believe it's best to look at gas equivalent rig count. And admittedly, simplistic adjustment to try to account for this associated gas involves assuming that each oil rig behaves more as if it is 3/4 oil and 1/4 gas, that the gas equivalent rig count equals gas-directed rigs plus 0.25x oil-directed rigs. The gas equivalent rig count calculated that way was essentially flat at 700 to 800 from mid-2012 through the end of 2014, so for about 2.5 years. The gas equivalent rig count then declined by about 45% by the spring of 2015, at which point it plateaued at about 380 until last summer and then again declined gradually by another 10% or so. Then starting in late autumn, the gas equivalent rig count declined an additional 25%-plus, reaching 246 last week. I recognize that only 121 of those are natural gas rigs. As an aside, that 121 compares to a high in Pennsylvania alone of about 117 rigs not that many years ago. So this 246 is nearly 2/3 below the last rig count of 2014 and 35% lower than it was just in August of last year. This sharp downturn in activity suggests lower future natural gas production. The question in my opinion is, when. That is, how long is that lag? At EQT, where we drill multi-well pads and long lateral wells, the lag from wells spud to turn in line or till is 9 to 12 months. Other drillers may have some shorter or longer lags, but they all have material lags. The existence of so-called ducks, that is drilled, but uncompleted wells, obviously lengthens the time lag between spud and till. Also improved efficiencies can mean that one rig today is equivalent to 1-plus rigs of a year ago, but this is only true for some efficiencies such as longer laterals. Efficiencies such as reduced cost spacing, which also tend to accelerate production, can affect the rate volume relationship somewhat over time, but mainly improve economics and, therefore, reduce the economic clearing price, at which supply equals demand. My point is to try to predict the exact timing of the production decline, but rather that this decline will occur, and it is best if we position ourselves to quickly respond to a higher gas price when the time is appropriate. We believe that a strong balance sheet does this. Based on my expectations of declining supply, I am reasonably bullish on natural gas prices once we have worked off with the current inventory surplus, as the current activity level is insufficient to meet demand over time. That said, increased efficiencies and a tighter focus on the core of the core have certainly decreased the clearing price for natural gas perhaps to the mid-$3 per Mcf range down from our previous expectations of around $4. I do expect that the price will go past that clearing price to the upside eventually, as we have seen in the past, as the lags that have delayed the production decline emanating from reduced activity will also delay an increase in supply from a future increased activity. Given the industry leaning cost structure of our core Marcellus acreage and potentially the Utica, EQT can make excellent returns at mid-$3 gas. Still, just as we think it is important to be well positioned when the market overshoots to the downside, we will want to be similarly well positioned when the market eventually overshoots to the high side, even though that high side overshoot won't involve prices nearly as high as they were even a few short years ago. 
In times of financial stress for our industry, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year and into next year from a commodity price perspective, we believe that having a strong balance sheet and available cash will put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. This is certainly true if my macro thesis is correct. However, if the alternative theses are prices that are much lower from much longer is correct, having a strong balance sheet and available cash will also put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. From what we can see, there's no reasonably likely thesis under which our shareholders would be well served by us surrendering those advantages. 
So in summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

One, those are reserves, not EURs, so anything produced prior to December 31 is not in there. That's fairly minor for the padded well. But it's also using the SEC definitions. So reasonable certainty, we have 2 producing wells. The padded well had almost no production data. So our reserve projections in that case tend to be pretty much on the conservative side. So I'm not sure the SEC numbers for the Utica wells really reflect very accurately our view. And we think it's too early to really comment on our view of the EUR for the second well. But I would say that it's consistent with our expectations of the Utica. It's very, very early, but probably not quite as good as the Scotts Run. I think the Scotts Run well will likely stand out for quite a while as an exceptional well and one that's definitely above the mean for the Utica."

Other than just say, I think -- one thing we've proven is, with the Scotts Run, clearly, there's going to be some areas of the Utica that are exceptionally good. And with the cost that we've already achieved, the economics of those types of locations will be superior to probably any of the Marcellus opportunities that we have.

That's just, I think, what happens. The comment on the other bigger deals is, as values drop, I think the companies that sell have strategic reasons for wanting to sell. And at that point, they probably rather sell smaller packages rather than larger packages because they don't like the values they kind of hoping for things to improve. And as we focus more and more on the core of the core, it just isn't the case. I mean, just as an example, there are no -- I think it's fair to say, there are no publicly-traded companies where we'd say all of their properties are in what for us, is the core of the core. It just doesn't exist. And then, of course, when you look at the financially troubled ones, they're just a whole different kettle of fish. You really can't go in and buy those, because the debt is trading it way under par, and it just doesn't work for a company like us to go in and execute that.

I think one of the big drivers in consolidation for us, though, is the enhancement inefficiencies you get with synergies from consolidation. They will apply regardless of whether the Utica works. And if the Utica works applies to the Utica, so longer lateral, more wells per pad, more efficient midstream system design.

A high-level story for the year as well as for the fourth",834,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.75 per diluted share compared to $3.43 per diluted share in 2014. A high-level story for the year as well as for the fourth quarter was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. Notably, production volumes were 27% higher than last year, and midstream gathering volumes were up by 28%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EQT earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT for 2015 were all down versus 2014 by any measure, although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $964.3 million in '15 compared to $1,424,000,000 in 2014. And I refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details. 
Results in the fourth quarter were similarly down. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss was $0.06 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the fourth quarter of '14. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $233.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Production sales volume was 13% higher than the fourth quarter of '14. We also realized 12% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a negative tax adjustment of $79.5 million to reserve certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards that may not be utilized in a low commodity price environment. This had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the year. Netting out the effects of this NOL carryforward adjustment in the fourth quarter as well as the regulatory asset tax adjustment in the second quarter would have resulted in an effective tax rate for the year of closer to 15%. Although subject to many factors, including commodity prices, transactions, et cetera, we think a range of 10% to 15% is a reasonable effective tax rate range for year 2016 modeling purposes. 
Now moving onto a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well. 
So starting with EQT Production. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 603.1 Bcf equivalent for 2015, again representing a 27% increase over 2014. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2015 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2015 was our sixth great year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized prices more than offset the increased sales of produced natural gas in our financial results. 
The EQT average realized price was $2.67 per Mcf equivalent for '15, and that was $1.49 or 36% lower per unit than last year. For segment reporting purposes, of that $2.67 realized by EQT Corporation, $1.74 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 allocated to EQT Midstream. The majority of the $0.93 is for gathering, which averaged $0.74 per Mcf equivalent for the year. 
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $1,251,600,000, excluding asset impairment charges and onetime drilling costs or 19% higher year-over-year. DD&A, SG&A and LOE were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the year as a result of lower prices. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, was 25% lower year-over-year, as volume increased more than expenses. 
Moving on to the midstream result. Operating income here was up 23% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering and transmission revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Gathering revenues also increased by almost 27% year-over-year as a result of higher gathered volumes in 2015. Total operating expenses at midstream were $318.8 million or $41.2 million higher than 2014, excluding an impairment and the exploration of some right-of-way options. This increase was consistent with the growth of the midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position, with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.25 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1 billion 2016 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash on hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for an update on the Utica program as well as some thoughts on today's reserve release."

As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review 2 topics: The 2015 reserve report and an update on our deep Utica program. Starting with the Utica. As you know, we turned in line our first deep Utica well, the Scotts Run 591360, in July of 20",1054,"Thanks, Phil. As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review 2 topics: The 2015 reserve report and an update on our deep Utica program. 
Starting with the Utica. As you know, we turned in line our first deep Utica well, the Scotts Run 591360, in July of 2015. The well continues to produce at a consistent 30 million cubic feet per well with a steady pressure decline. The well is exceeding our previous forecast, and we now expect this well to flow at 30 million cubic feet a day until mid-April before it begin its production decline. As a result, we've revised the range of our EUR estimate to between 5.1 and 5.9 Bcfe per thousand foot of lateral. As a reminder, this well has a completed lateral length of 3,221 feet. And to date, this well has produced 5.8 Bcf. 
Our second well, the padded 593066 was completed at the very end of December. This well has a 5,200-foot lateral and was completed with a 29-stage frac job. After initial cleanup and the 24-hour flow test at 43 million cubic feet per day, we shut the well in for an extended reservoir pressure test and to install the permanent production facilities. On January 29, we brought the well online at a choke-restricted rate of 20 million cubic feet per day with a floating casing pressure of 8,700 psi. The initial results from the padded well appeared to be in line with other deep Utica wells in the area and are consistent with our expectations of the Utica across our core focus area. 
In addition to the 2 producing wells, we spud another 2 Utica wells. The Big 190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia has been drilled to TD, and we are now in the process of completing the 35-stage frac job. It has a 6,300-foot lateral and has an expected turn in-line date in late February or early March. 
Our fourth well, the Shipment well in Greene County, Pennsylvania is currently being top set with a planned lateral length of 7,000 feet. On the cost side for the Utica, we've been able to achieve significant savings on each of our wells and are ahead of our schedule to meet our target of $12.5 million to $14 million per well. Savings have been realized in all phases of the development cycle with the most significant savings coming from improved drilling efficiency. Adjusting for lateral length, the padded well cost $17.3 million, and the Big 190 cost $15.4 million. On a cost-per-foot basis, we've successfully lowered our costs from $9,600 per foot for the Scotts Run well to $2,800 per foot for Big 190. As a reminder, we have 2 objectives for our 2016 Utica program: One, get the cost per well down to our target range, which we expect to achieve on our currently drilling shipment well; and two, confirm the productivity of the reservoir within our core Utica focus areas in Southwestern PA and Northern West Virginia. If we can accomplish both objectives, we expect that Utica returns in the core area will be competitive with or better than the core Marcellus, and we will work on a plan to include Utica in our future development plans. We will update you on our progress each quarter. 
Moving on to the reserves report. As you saw in our press release this morning, we announced total proved reserves of 10 Tcfe, with 6.3 Tcfe of these reserves associated with wells that have already been developed. This proved developed reserves totals 30% higher than year-end 2014 and includes 2.1 Tcfe of increases. Within that 2.1 Tcfe increase is 386 Bcfe improved developed reserves from wells that were unproved in 2014, but were ultimately drilled and completed in 2015. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic, even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves. 
Also contributing to our increased proved developed reserves is over 300 Bcfe from producing wells that are outperforming our previous forecast. Additionally, we converted 1.5 Tcfe or 25% of our 2014 PUD reserves into the proved developed category. We also cut our 5-year PUD development plan in half, which is consistent with our reduced activity in 2016. Both of these factors contributed to a 37% decrease in PUD reserves. 
Looking at just our Marcellus reserves. The average proved location considering both developed and undeveloped is 700 feet longer and has an EUR that is 1.4 Bcfe greater than the average proved Marcellus location booked in 2014. These statistics demonstrate consistently strong well performance as well as EQT's ability to continue leveraging our acreage position within our core development area, allowing us to drill longer laterals. In fact, our PUD reserves reflect 337 Bcfe of increases that is directly related to length extensions of previously booked undeveloped locations. These length extensions not only boost the economics and reserves of previously booked locations, but also allowed us to book 703 Bcfe of new PUD locations that were previously too short to be considered economic PUDs. To further offset the effect of low pricing, EQT continue to improve our efficiency and drive development cost lower. The development cost of wells completed in 2015 was $0.83 per Mcfe versus $1.15 per Mcfe for wells completed in 2014. This 27% reduction was driven by longer laterals, limits [ph] in drilling and completion efficiency and significant reductions in service costs, particularly on the frac side. 
Our current estimate of total resource potential is 78 Tcfe, which now includes 25 Tcfe attributed to the core of our deep Utica play. Also within that 78 Tcfe of resource potential are our probable and possible reserves. As noted in this morning's release, using the SEC's required trailing 12-month pricing methodology resulted in total probable and possible reserves of 14.6 Tcfe. If you look at forward-looking prices, which are more representative of our development assumptions, our probable and possible reserves would total 35 Tcfe. Neither of those probable and possible totals includes any deep Utica reserves as we are relegating that play to other resource potential for now with the exception of the 24 Bcf of proved reserves from our 2 producing wells. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."

This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December, as this is our first call since that time. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 bill",1146,"Thank you, Steve. This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December, as this is our first call since that time. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 billion in cash and with nothing drawn in our $1.5 billion unsecured revolver. In that context and given that we have other potential sources of cash such as another midstream drop, we were comfortable with the CapEx estimate that was moderately higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2016. However, we do not have any plans to significantly erode that strong liquidity position as we believe that our current conservative financial approach is appropriate for today's environment. The rest of my remarks will elaborate on that view. 
First, we're have been looking to add to our core acreage position for the past year, but have not yet transacted, as sellers have not fully accepted the valuation impact of low commodity prices. Ironically, even if sellers' expectations did begin coming more into line with current market realities, we narrowed our geographic focus to possibilities that have real consolidation benefits within the core of the core as we have referred to it. As the market continues to evolve, it seems to us reasonably likely that there will be some actual transactions in the first half of 2016. However, given our tighter focus as well as some other attributes to the current market, smaller asset transactions seem more likely than larger or whole company deals. 
Speaking of the market, let's shift to our view of the natural gas supply-demand market. You may recall that I do consider rig count to be a reasonable, if rough, leading indicator of natural gas production, though some adjustments need to be made to glean any meaning from the published data. For instance, there's a longer lead time between spuds and marketable production than there used to be. Rigs are more efficient than they used to be, especially because of longer laterals and also improved completion techniques, and more natural gas production comes from drilling that the data associates with crude oil-focused activity. As an example of the latter issue that is associated to gas, when using the published Baker Hughes data, we believe it's best to look at gas equivalent rig count. And admittedly, simplistic adjustment to try to account for this associated gas involves assuming that each oil rig behaves more as if it is 3/4 oil and 1/4 gas, that the gas equivalent rig count equals gas-directed rigs plus 0.25x oil-directed rigs. The gas equivalent rig count calculated that way was essentially flat at 700 to 800 from mid-2012 through the end of 2014, so for about 2.5 years. The gas equivalent rig count then declined by about 45% by the spring of 2015, at which point it plateaued at about 380 until last summer and then again declined gradually by another 10% or so. Then starting in late autumn, the gas equivalent rig count declined an additional 25%-plus, reaching 246 last week. I recognize that only 121 of those are natural gas rigs. As an aside, that 121 compares to a high in Pennsylvania alone of about 117 rigs not that many years ago. So this 246 is nearly 2/3 below the last rig count of 2014 and 35% lower than it was just in August of last year. This sharp downturn in activity suggests lower future natural gas production. The question in my opinion is, when. That is, how long is that lag? At EQT, where we drill multi-well pads and long lateral wells, the lag from wells spud to turn in line or till is 9 to 12 months. Other drillers may have some shorter or longer lags, but they all have material lags. The usage of so-called ducks, that is drilled, but uncompleted wells, obviously lengthens the time lag between spud and till. Also improved efficiencies can mean that 1 rig today is equivalent to 1-plus rigs of a year ago, but this is only true for some efficiencies such as longer laterals. Efficiencies such as reduced cluster spacing, which also tend to accelerate production, can affect the rig volume relationship somewhat over time, but mainly improve economics and, therefore, reduce the economic clearing price, at which supply equals demand. My point isn't to try to predict the exact timing of the production decline, but rather that this decline will occur, and it is best if we position ourselves to quickly respond to a higher gas price when the time is appropriate. We believe that a strong balance sheet does this. Based on my expectations of declining supply, I am reasonably bullish on natural gas prices once we have worked off the current inventory surplus, as the current activity level is insufficient to meet demand over time. That said, increased efficiencies and a tighter focus on the core of the core have certainly decreased the clearing price for natural gas perhaps to the mid-$3 per Mcf range down from our previous expectations of around $4. I do expect that the price will go past that clearing price to the upside eventually, as we have seen in the past, as the lags that have delayed the production decline emanating from reduced activity will also delay an increase in supply from a future increase in activity. Given the industry leading cost structure of our core Marcellus acreage and potentially the Utica, EQT can make excellent returns at mid-$3 gas. Still, just as we think it is important to be well positioned when the market overshoots to the downside, we will want to be similarly well positioned when the market eventually overshoots to the high side, even though that high side overshoot won't involve prices nearly as high as they were even a few short years ago. 
In times of financial stress for our industry, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year and into next year from a commodity price perspective, we believe that having a strong balance sheet and available cash will put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. This is certainly true if my macro thesis is correct. However, if the alternative thesis are prices that are much lower for much longer is correct, having a strong balance sheet and available cash will also put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. From what we can see, there's no reasonably likely thesis under which our shareholders would be well served by us surrendering those advantages. 
So in summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

One, those are reserves, not EURs, so anything produced prior to December 31 is not in there. That's fairly minor for the padded well. But it's also using the SEC definitions. So reasonable certainty, we have 2 producing wells. The padded well had almost no production data. So our reserve projections in that case tend to be pretty much on the conservative side. So I'm not sure the SEC numbers for the Utica wells really reflect very accurately our view. And we think it's too early to really comment on our view of the EUR for the second well. But I would say that it's consistent with our expectations of the Utica. It's very, very early, but probably not quite as good as the Scotts Run.

And I think clearly, the Scotts Run, which I would repeat, we don't expect the Scotts Run result to be the norm. So that's not when we factor in, what we think the Utica is going to do. We're assuming something a little less productive than the Scotts Run, but yes, I think it -- our view is that if we can get within that cost range and have the productivity that we think we can get, there'll be areas that are competitive and probably some areas that will outcompete some of our best Marcellus."

The first one and going into the year are -- was our primary focus was to get the cost down. Since we started at around $30 million a well. We were certain that cost in that range were never going to yield an economic project. We've gotten those cost down quite a bit faster than I had expected. So that was our primary objective, but I think we're almost there. We can't quite declare victory yet, but we are getting very, very close. And the second objective was to understand the productivity and the extent within the core of that productivity of the Utica, and that's why we have to drill a 5- to 10-well program this year and get various data points. And as we all know, early in new plays, there is always a lot of improvement even on the completion side. You have to get up the learning curve. So we'll make some mistakes. We'll have some -- obviously, we'll have some fantastic wells. We'll probably have some underperforming wells, as we experiment with different techniques. And we have to gather that data and analyze it, and it's a lengthy process. So we're going to spend the year gathering data and studying it.

And probably that -- I guess you could always say that the productivity at the specific wells that we drilled is going to influence what happens in the next year. In this case, you probably particularly say it hinges on some of the Utica, even though there's not that many Utica wells. But generally speaking, I think it has to be for any of the companies that you're looking at that when you see lower capital expenditure in these kind of lags that when you look out another 9 to 12 months, you're going to be seeing a reduction in that -- in the growth rate. I think there's going to be folks like us, where it's a -- you'll see that real reduction in the growth rate. And I think probably the great untalked about elephant in the room, as it were, is the companies where they've had a sharp reduction in capital expenditures and their growth rates going to have parentheses on it in 2017. And frankly, I think that will probably have a psychologically beneficial effect on the natural gas price market, but that's still within the context of a clearing price that's a lot lower than what we would've thought maybe a couple of years back.

The sellers have a more difficult time adapting to lower valuations than the buyers do. I mean, I don't think that's unique in oil and gas. I think you probably see that in real estate, if you see that in many number of places. I'm guessing that the Houston real estate market is probably exhibiting some of those same characteristics. That's just, I think, what happens. The comment on the other bigger deals is, as values drop, I think the companies that sell have strategic reasons for wanting to sell. And at that point, they probably rather sell smaller packages rather than larger packages because they don't like the values they kind of hoping for things to improve. And as we focus more and more on the core of the core, it just isn't the case. I mean, just as an example, there are no -- I think it's fair to say, there are no publicly-traded companies where we'd say all of their properties are in what, for us, is the core of the core. It just doesn't exist. And then, of course, when you look at the financially troubled ones, they're just a whole different kettle of fish. You really can't go in and buy those, because the debt is trading it way under par, and it just doesn't work for a company like us to go in and execute that. So I just think all of those things conspire to restrict the number of opportunities for transactions that makes sense for both buyer and seller."

I think one of the big drivers in consolidation for us, though, is the enhancement inefficiencies you get with synergies from consolidation. They will apply regardless of whether the Utica works. And if the Utica works applies to the Utica, so longer lateral, more wells per pad, more efficient midstream system design. So all of those values are incremental value exists regardless of what happens within Utica. So I think there's still a compelling case for consolidation given how fragmented the Northeast natural gas plays are that there's definitely a lot of value add in having bigger more contiguous acreage positions."

The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's first quarter 2016 results. Next, Steve will give a Utica update. And finally, David will discuss certain market and strategic matters. Following the prepared remarks, David, Steve, Randy and Rob will all be available to answer your questions. 
But first, I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and other risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations of most comparable GAAP financial measures.

Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our press reconciliation and production segment page. Historically, we presented the cost of gathering and transporting are gas as revenue deductions on the price reconciliation in production segment page. Starting today, gathering, transmission and processing costs are not reported as expenses on the production segment page. The exception is the transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. The new net marketing services line on the production segment page includes these costs as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation. Previously, this capacity cost, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016, were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission cost on the price reconciliation; while the marketing recoveries, which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential. The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016 to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf. So netting these 2 charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. 
We posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format. 
Now for an update on the remaining drop-down. We are currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop-down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there's about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million. As Pat mention, EQGP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for that calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the second quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The high level in history for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment with another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and record gathering volumes of midstream. With the exception of $3.8 million restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks fairly brief. 
The story at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices. 
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million in the first quarter of last year as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is clearly cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million at operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results in line with the median of wells drilled into deep Utica well by EQT and our peers so far. 
For the Utica to compete with capital with Marcellus, we're targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well, combined with the higher percentage of the EU are being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering compression cost, should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus. We currently have 3 wells producing, the Scotts Run and padded wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania and the BIG-190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. This Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations, and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral. The results of the padded and Big 190 wells were not as strong as our Scotts Run well or in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these 2 wells. 
The shipment well was spud in January and is currently being fracked while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the Big 177. We used ceramic [indiscernible] on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the padded and BIG-190 wells, which used sand as the profit. It is not clear that the prop and difference explains the result, but we decided to use ceramic prop in the next 3 completions, including the shipment, to determine that the prop and type has an impact on well productivity. The good news is, we have negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic profit since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400-foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run. 
On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling cost continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells. On the completion side, we will be testing the plug technology for the first time on the shipment well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well if successful. Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well cost even with ceramic prop. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress on the Deep Utica, and I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

I would like to briefly provide 2 updates and 1 other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent",680,"Thank you, Steve. I would like to briefly provide 2 updates and 1 other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that February call, the gas equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014. We are beginning to see what appear to be some signs of a supply reduction as a pro-U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those 2014 rig count probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggest that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increases continues to be uncertain. 
Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well positioned comparatively to adjusted development plans should higher prices materialize. I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessarily to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment as we have been in the current less-than-constructive economic environment. 
On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining. If you look at our website, for a hard copy of our most recent investment presentations, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area, all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play. If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and interested at looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area, again as defined by that rectangle in our current investor presentation. 
To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feed of 10 [ph] those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target. True synergies, if you will. My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I've focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholders barring the investment risk of employees portfolios via defined-benefit pension plans. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, those many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade. As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We set about strengthening the plan over the years, and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to 0. 
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

I think we're still exploring that, so it is still a fairly anomalous well in terms of how productive it's been. So clearly, there's really 2 areas of focus, one is the size of the drainage area size or the size of the box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir we don't have a lot of experience with yet, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there's still some questions about basically the density of the gas and the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with. So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels, so there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we're have a number of experiments, tests going on in both of those years. But I would say it's, bottom line, it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what the recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be and, in fact, what's really driving that the extreme productivity we're seeing."

But I think in this environment, we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the upstream and the midstream than we probably would've expected a couple of years ago. And I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects. But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like, at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the upstream and the development of the midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure-play on one side or the other. And frankly, on the FERC regulator pipeline, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer shippers are saying, and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where the -- having the synergies between the upstream and the midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder."

For the most part, we happen to be focused on transactions that are relatively small in nature. They're not public company transactions. That's just the nature of what happens to be out there. And we do still think that it makes sense for us to be cognizant of the credit risk when we look at those acquisitions. And I guess maybe I'll just leave it at that. And frankly, it is more beneficial on the midstream side than the upstream. I think we've seen plenty of peers that have lower credit ratings than us, and I don't think -- I mean, just a little bit lower some investment-grade. It doesn't -- I think you could easily argue, it doesn't hurt them. But on the midstream side, I think to have a seat at the table and I do see a lot of opportunities maybe even more opportunities than we would have before with the changes in the macroenvironment and how it's affecting a lot of the other companies out there, I'd still think it's valuable to, in this environment, to maintain that investment-grade rating and soon assume that we will behave in a manner that is consistent with that view. And Steve, do you want to provide any more thoughts on what you're seeing on the M&A?"

We're really hoping to find things where we have more synergies than our competitors, which allows us to be competitive on price, yet get it at a price that still leaves a lot of value for our shareholders.

We don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and recently the one with the first well is at these depths with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is we're pushing the upper limit of it. We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. It's mostly due to crushing and/or embedment of the sand into the shale, mostly crushing that we are concerned about. So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand, but that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells, and the cost differential has been cut nearly in half. We thought it was wise to go back and see how much productivity difference that's driving."

The fact is that we have a broad portfolio of upstream capacity, and we have the Ohio Valley Connector project that is in the currently in construction that we anticipate or expect to come online at the end of this year, which will tie into our capacity and improve our pricing from that standpoint. Now from the midstream perspective, obviously, as we have been playing out these projects and build out our hub and are executing accordingly, we think that obviously increases the value of those assets over the long term and even in the short term.

And so I do agree with your premise, and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be a work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we chatted about before different investors for midstream and upstream, that is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time. And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float with that's a good marker to be using for the midstream value at EQT. And I think we also been pretty clear that we've got the notion over time having more flow out there is going to be a way to get my confidence level. That's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, although I noticed that it's now trading after the whole market has been -- haven't had a tough period since its IPO almost a year ago, is now trading just a little bit above its, just above its IPO price. I still think the that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe and I think I've said this before that I fear that some of that is just on kind of a sticker -- like a reverse sticker shock that folks models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current field this still that falls out of those calculation just relatively low number. And there's a concern about bidding it the price up such that, that current deal drops too much. But I think as we continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at EQGP level, that will tend to go away, and that aspect of revaluation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far some of those other issues that I mentioned, we do work through those issues. We do see it same way that you do, and we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value."

269924,330336333,965752,"EQT Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat. Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our press reconciliation and production segment page.

Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our press reconciliation and production segment page. Historically, we presented the cost of gathering and transporting are gas as revenue deductions on the price reconciliation in production segment page. Starting today, gathering, transmission and processing costs are not reported as expenses on the production segment page. The exception is the transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. The new net marketing services line on the production segment page includes these costs as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation. Previously, this capacity cost, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016, were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission cost on the price reconciliation; while the marketing recoveries, which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential. The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016 to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf. So netting these 2 charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. 
We posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format. 
Now for an update on the remaining drop-down. We are currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop-down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there's about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million. As Pat mention, EQGP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for that calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the second quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The high level in history for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment with another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and record gathering volumes of midstream. With the exception of $3.8 million restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks fairly brief. 
The story at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices. 
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million in the first quarter of last year as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is clearly cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million at operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results in line with the median of wells drilled into deep Utica well by EQT and our peers so far. 
For the Utica to compete with capital with Marcellus, we're targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well, combined with the higher percentage of the EU are being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering compression cost, should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus. We currently have 3 wells producing, the Scotts Run and padded wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania and the BIG-190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. This Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations, and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral. The results of the padded and Big 190 wells were not as strong as our Scotts Run well or in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these 2 wells. 
The shipment well was spud in January and is currently being fracked while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the Big 177. We used ceramic [indiscernible] on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the padded and BIG-190 wells, which used sand as the profit. It is not clear that the prop and difference explains the result, but we decided to use ceramic prop in the next 3 completions, including the shipment, to determine that the prop and type has an impact on well productivity. The good news is, we have negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic profit since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400-foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run. 
On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling cost continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells. On the completion side, we will be testing the plug technology for the first time on the shipment well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well if successful. Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well cost even with ceramic prop. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress on the Deep Utica, and I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

I would like to briefly provide 2 updates and 1 other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production.

The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that February call, the gas equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014. We are beginning to see what appear to be some signs of a supply reduction as a pro-U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those 2014 rig count probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggest that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increases continues to be uncertain. 
Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well positioned comparatively to adjusted development plans should higher prices materialize. I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessarily to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment as we have been in the current less-than-constructive economic environment. 
On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining. If you look at our website, for a hard copy of our most recent investment presentations, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area, all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play. If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and interested at looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area, again as defined by that rectangle in our current investor presentation. 
To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feed of 10 [ph] those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target. True synergies, if you will. My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I've focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholders barring the investment risk of employees portfolios via defined-benefit pension plans. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, those many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade. As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We set about strengthening the plan over the years, and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to 0. 
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

I think we're still exploring that, so it is still a fairly anomalous well in terms of how productive it's been. So clearly, there's really 2 areas of focus, one is the size of the drainage area size or the size of the box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir we don't have a lot of experience with yet, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there's still some questions about basically the density of the gas and the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with. So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels, so there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we're have a number of experiments, tests going on in both of those years. But I would say it's, bottom line, it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what the recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be and, in fact, what's really driving that the extreme productivity we're seeing."

But I think in this environment, we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the upstream and the midstream than we probably would've expected a couple of years ago. And I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects. But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like, at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the upstream and the development of the midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure-play on one side or the other. And frankly, on the FERC regulator pipeline, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer shippers are saying, and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where the -- having the synergies between the upstream and the midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder."

We don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and recently the one with the first well is at these depths with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is we're pushing the upper limit of it. We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. It's mostly due to crushing and/or embedment of the sand into the shale, mostly crushing that we are concerned about. So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand, but that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells, and the cost differential has been cut nearly in half.

We expect the shipment well to come in within that range and below $14 million, excluding some of the science we're going to do on well. So Neal asked earlier, we are cutting the core on the shipment wells, so there'll be some extra cost there. But if you excluded that, we expect the shipment well to be within the range. Then things like the dissolvable frac plugs, if that works, we can implemented in future wells across the whole well. That's roughly $700,000 savings that we haven't factored in yet. So very, very confident that we're going to be in the midpoint of that range voer the next few wells and with still lots of opportunity to for improvement.

And again, I think the difficulty is going to be -- since I do believe prices are going to move past that, that economic clearing price to be disciplined about moving up to the top as opposed to getting caught up with kind of the opposite of the current, if you will, the press feeling in the market that we've seen it before where gets you [indiscernible] Incidentally, when you talk about the current year, we have tended to view that as just being a standard commercial activity.

And so I do agree with your premise, and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be a work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we chatted about before different investors for midstream and upstream, that is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time. And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float with that's a good marker to be using for the midstream value at EQT. And I think we also been pretty clear that we've got the notion over time having more flow out there is going to be a way to get my confidence level. That's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, although I noticed that it's now trading after the whole market has been -- haven't had a tough period since its IPO almost a year ago, is now trading just a little bit above its, just above its IPO price. I still think the that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe and I think I've said this before that I fear that some of that is just on kind of a sticker -- like a reverse sticker shock that folks models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current field this still that falls out of those calculation just relatively low number. And there's a concern about bidding it the price up such that, that current deal drops too much. But I think as we continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at EQGP level, that will tend to go away, and that aspect of revaluation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far some of those other issues that I mentioned, we do work through those issues. We do see it same way that you do, and we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value."

The exception is that transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. 
The new net marketing services line on the Production segment page includes these costs as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation. Previously, these capacity costs, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016 were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission costs on the price reconciliation, while the marketing recoveries, which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential. 
The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016 to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf. So netting these 2 charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. 
We've posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format. 
Now for an update on the remaining drop-down. We are currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop-down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there is about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million. As Pat mentioned, EQT GP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for the calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the second quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The high level of story for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment, with another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream. With the exception of a $3.8 million here on the restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks fairly brief. 
The story at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices. 
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million than the first quarter of last year as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes the cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results in line with the median of wells drilled in the deep Utica by EQT and our peers so far. 
For the Utica to compete for capital with the Marcellus, we are targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well combined with the higher percentage of the EUR being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering compression costs should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus. 
We currently have 3 wells producing, the Scotts Run and padded wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania and the BIG-190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. The Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations, and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral. The results of the padded and Big-190 wells were not as strong as our Scotts Run well or in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these 2 wells. 
The shipment well was spud in January and is currently being fraced, while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the Big-177. We used ceramic proppant on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the padded and BIG-190 wells, which used sand as the proppant. It is not clear that the proppant difference explains the results, but we have decided to use ceramic proppant in the next 3 completions, including the shipment, to determine that the proppant type has an impact on well productivity. The good news is, we have negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic proppant since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400-foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run. 
On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling cost continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells. On the completion side, we will be testing dissolvable plug technology for the first time on the shipment well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well if successful. Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well costs even with ceramic proppant. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the deep Utica. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. 
Since that February call, the gas equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014. We are beginning to see what appeared to be some signs of a supply reduction as April U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those end 2014 rig count probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggest that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increase continues to be uncertain. 
Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well positioned comparatively to adjust our development plans should higher prices materialize. I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessary to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment as we have been in the current less-than-constructive economic environment. 
On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position, but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining. If you look at our website, for a hard copy of our most recent investor presentations, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area, all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play. If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and not interested in looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area, again as defined by that rectangle in our current investor presentation. 
To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feed of pay in those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target. True synergies, if you will. My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholders baring the investment risk of employees portfolios via defined benefit pension plans. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, those many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade. As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We said about shrinking the plan over the years, and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to 0. 
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

So clearly, there's really 2 areas of focus, one is the size of the -- the drainage area size or the size of the box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir we don't have a lot of experience with yet, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there's still some questions about basically the density of the gas in the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with. So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels, so there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we're having number of experiments and tests going on in both of those areas. But I would say it's -- bottom line is it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what a recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be and, in fact, what's really driving that extreme productivity we're seeing."

But we -- I think in this environment we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the upstream and the midstream than we probably would've expected a couple of years ago. And I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects. But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like, at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the upstream and the development of the midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure-play on one side or the other. And frankly, on the FERC regulated pipelines, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer shippers are saying, and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where the -- having the synergies between the upstream and the midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder."

We don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and the reason we went with it on the first well is at these depths with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is we're pushing the upper limit of it. We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. And it's mostly due to crushing and/or embedment of the sand into the shale, mostly crushing that we are concerned about. So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand, but since that -- that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells, and the cost differential has been cut nearly in half. We thought it was wise to go back and see how much productivity difference that's driving."

So Neal had asked earlier, we are cutting the core on the shipment wells, so there'll be some extra cost there. But if you exclude that, we expect the shipment well to be within the range. And then things like the dissolvable frac plugs, if that works, we can implement it on future wells across the whole well. That's roughly $700,000 savings that we haven't factored in yet.

And so I do agree with your premise, and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be a work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we've chatted about before different investors from midstream and upstream, that is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time. And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price, and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float whether that's a good marker to be using for the midstream value at EQT. And I think we've also been pretty clear that we've got a notion that over time having more flowed out there is going to be a way to get my confidence level that that's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, although I noticed that it's now trading after the whole market has been -- had a tough period since its IPO of almost a year ago. It Is now trading just a little bit above its, just above its IPO price. I still think that, that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe and I think I've said this before that I fear that some of that is just kind of a sticker -- like a reverse sticker shock that folks models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current yield is still -- that falls out of those calculation just a relatively low number. And there's a concern about bidding it up -- the price up such that, that current deal drops too much. But I think as you continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at the EQGP level, that will tend to go away, and that aspect of revaluation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far some of those other issues that I mentioned, we do work through those issues. We do see it same way that you do, and we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value."

To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 10:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20 this morning. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's first quarter 2016 results. Next, Steve will give a Utica update. And finally, Dave will discuss certain market and strategic matters. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Randy and Rob will all be available to answer your questions. 
But first, I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and other risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations of most comparable GAAP financial measures.

269924,330336333,966203,"EQT Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat.

Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our price reconciliation and production segment page. Historically, we presented the cost of gathering and transporting our gas as revenue deductions on the price reconciliation and production segment page. Starting today, gathering, transmission and processing costs are not reported as expenses on the production segment page. The exception is that transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. 
The new net marketing services line on the Production segment page includes these costs as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation. Previously, these capacity costs, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016 were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission cost on the price reconciliation, while the marketing recoveries, which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential. 
The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016 to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf. So netting these 2 charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. 
We've posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format. 
Now for an update on the remaining drop-down. We are currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop-down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there is about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million. As Pat mentioned, EQT GP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for the calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the second quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The high level of story for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment, with another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream. With the exception of a $3.8 million Huron restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks fairly brief. 
The story at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity costs in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices. 
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million than (sic) [ higher than ] the first quarter of last year as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes the cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results in line with the median of wells drilled in the deep Utica by EQT and our peers so far. 
For the Utica to compete for capital with the Marcellus, we are targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well combined with the higher percentage of the EUR being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering compression costs should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus. 
We currently have 3 wells producing, the Scotts Run and Pettit wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania and the BIG-190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. The Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations, and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral. The results of the Pettit and BIG-190 wells, while not as strong as our Scotts Run well, are in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these 2 wells. 
The Shipman well was spud in January and is currently being fracked, while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the BIG-177. We used ceramic proppant on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the Pettit and BIG-190 wells, which used sand as the proppant. It is not clear that the proppant difference explains the results, but we have decided to use ceramic proppant in the next 3 completions, including the Shipman, to determine if the proppant type has an impact on well productivity. The good news is, we have negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic proppant since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400-foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run. 
On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling costs continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells. On the completion side, we will be testing dissolvable plug technology for the first time on the Shipman well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well if successful. Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well costs even with ceramic proppant. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the deep Utica. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

I would like to briefly provide 2 updates and 1 other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production.

The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. 
Since that February call, the gas equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014. We are beginning to see what appear to be some signs of a supply reduction as April U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those end 2014 rig counts probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggests that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increase continues to be uncertain. 
Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well positioned comparatively to adjust our development plans should higher prices materialize. I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessary to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment as we have been in the current less-than-constructive economic environment. 
On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position, but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining. If you look at our website for hard copy of our most recent investor presentations, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area, all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play. If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and not interested in looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area, again as defined by that rectangle in our current investor presentation. 
To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feet of pay in those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target. True synergies, if you will. 
My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholders baring the investment risk of employees portfolios via defined benefit pension plans. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, those many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade. As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We set about shrinking the plan over the years, and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to 0. 
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

So clearly, there's really 2 areas of focus, one is the size of the -- the drainage area size or the size of the box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir we don't have a lot of experience with yet, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there's still some questions about basically the density of the gas in the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with. So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels, so there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we're -- have a number of experiments and tests going on in both of those areas. But I would say it's -- bottom line is it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what a recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be and, in fact, what's really driving that extreme productivity we're seeing."

But we -- I think in this environment we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the upstream and the midstream than we probably would've expected a couple of years ago. And I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects. But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like, at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the upstream and the development of the midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure-play on one side or the other. And frankly, on the FERC regulated pipelines, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer-shippers are saying, and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where the -- having the synergies between the upstream and the midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder."

We don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and the reason we went with it on the first well is at these depths with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is we're pushing the upper limit of it. We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. And it's mostly due to crushing and/or embedment of the sand into the shale, mostly crushing that we are concerned about. So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand, but since that -- that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells, and the cost differential has been cut nearly in half. We thought it was wise to go back and see how much productivity difference that's driving."

So Neal had asked earlier, we are cutting a core on the Shipman well, so there'll be some extra cost there. But if you exclude that, we expect the Shipman well to be within the range.

When the price is below what we think is the economic clearing price, we tend to be more at the low end of the target range that we have. And when the price moves above that, we're more at the high end. So now I'd say we're probably a little bit more, as we think about it not for '16 but as you look beyond it, we'd still be layering hedges in, but we'd be staying more at the low end of what our target range would be. And again, I think the difficulty is going to be -- since I do believe prices are going to move past that economic clearing price to be disciplined about moving up to the top as opposed to getting caught up with kind of the opposite of the current, if you will, depressed feeling in the market that we've seen it before where it gets euphoric. Incidentally, when you talk about the current year, we have tended to view that as being just a standard commercial activity. So we let our commercial group make decisions about the things that they want to do in year to take advantage of some of the opportunities that they see. We don't really view that as hedging so much as just normal commercial activity."

And so I do agree with your premise, and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be a work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we've chatted about before different investors from midstream and upstream, that is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time. And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price, and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float whether that's a good marker to be using for the midstream value at EQT. And I think we've also been pretty clear that we've got a notion that over time having more float out there is going to be a way to get more confidence level that that's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, although I noticed that it's now trading after the whole market has been -- had a tough period since its IPO of almost a year ago. It Is now trading just a little bit above its, just above its IPO price. I still think that, that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe and I think I've said this before that I fear that some of that is just kind of a sticker -- like a reverse sticker shock that folk's models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current yield is still -- that falls out of those calculations is a relatively low number. And there's a concern about bidding it up -- the price up such that, that current yield drops too much. But I think as you continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at the EQGP level, that will tend to go away, and that aspect of valuation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far some of those other issues that I mentioned, we do work through those issues. We do see it same way that you do, and we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value."

Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our price reconciliation and production segment page. Historically, we presented the cost of gathering and transporting our gas as revenue deductions on the price reconciliation and production segment page. Starting today, gathering, transmission and processing costs are not reported as expenses on the production segment page. The exception is that transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. 
The new net marketing services line on the Production segment page includes these costs as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation. Previously, these capacity costs, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016 were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission cost on the price reconciliation, while the marketing recoveries, which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential. 
The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016 to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf. So netting these 2 charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. 
We've posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format. 
Now for an update on the remaining drop-down. We are currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop-down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there is about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million. As Pat mentioned, EQT GP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for the calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the second quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The high level of story for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment, with another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream. With the exception of a $3.8 million Huron restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks fairly brief. 
The story at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity costs in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices. 
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million than (sic) [ higher than ] the first quarter of last year as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes the cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results in line with the median of wells drilled in the deep Utica by EQT and our peers so far. 
For the Utica to compete for capital with the Marcellus, we are targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well combined with the higher percentage of the EUR being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering compression costs should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus. 
We currently have 3 wells producing, the Scotts Run and Pettit wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania and the BIG-190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. The Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations, and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral. The results of the Pettit and BIG-190 wells, while not as strong as our Scotts Run well, are in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these 2 wells. 
The Shipman well was spud in January and is currently being fracked, while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the BIG-177. We used ceramic proppant on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the Pettit and BIG-190 wells, which used sand as the proppant. It is not clear that the proppant difference explains the results, but we have decided to use ceramic proppant in the next 3 completions, including the Shipman, to determine if the proppant type has an impact on well productivity. The good news is, we have negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic proppant since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400-foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run. 
On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling costs continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells. On the completion side, we will be testing dissolvable plug technology for the first time on the Shipman well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well if successful. Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well costs even with ceramic proppant. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the deep Utica. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

I would like to briefly provide 2 updates and 1 other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent",683,"Thank you, Steve. I would like to briefly provide 2 updates and 1 other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. 
Since that February call, the gas equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014. We are beginning to see what appear to be some signs of a supply reduction as April U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those end 2014 rig counts probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggests that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increase continues to be uncertain. 
Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well positioned comparatively to adjust our development plans should higher prices materialize. I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessary to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment as we have been in the current less-than-constructive economic environment. 
On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position, but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining. If you look at our website for hard copy of our most recent investor presentations, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area, all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play. If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and not interested in looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area, again as defined by that rectangle in our current investor presentation. 
To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feet of pay in those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target. True synergies, if you will. 
My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholders baring the investment risk of employees portfolios via defined benefit pension plans. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, those many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade. As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We set about shrinking the plan over the years, and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to 0. 
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

I think we're still exploring that, so it is still a fairly anomalous well in terms of how productive it's been. So clearly, there's really 2 areas of focus, one is the size of the -- the drainage area size or the size of the box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir we don't have a lot of experience with yet, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there's still some questions about basically the density of the gas in the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with. So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels, so there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we're -- have a number of experiments and tests going on in both of those areas. But I would say it's -- bottom line is it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what a recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be and, in fact, what's really driving that extreme productivity we're seeing."

But we -- I think in this environment we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the upstream and the midstream than we probably would've expected a couple of years ago. And I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects. But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like, at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the upstream and the development of the midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure-play on one side or the other. And frankly, on the FERC regulated pipelines, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer-shippers are saying, and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where the -- having the synergies between the upstream and the midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder."

We don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and the reason we went with it on the first well is at these depths with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is we're pushing the upper limit of it. We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. And it's mostly due to crushing and/or embedment of the sand into the shale, mostly crushing that we are concerned about. So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand, but since that -- that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells, and the cost differential has been cut nearly in half.

Smaller pads, shorter laterals end up being shorter. Bigger pads take longer. We have done some optimization modeling of that to see what we could do to shorten it up. And we do have some options where, if we had the right economic incentives we could spend a little bit more money, primarily on more rig moves. So we'd move the rig more often and get wells online quicker that we -- and again, it would be based on the forward curve and what we thought the prices were going to do so whether it be worth spending the extra money.

We expect the Shipman well to come in within that range, so below $14 million, excluding some of the science we're going to do on well. So Neal had asked earlier, we are cutting a core on the Shipman well, so there'll be some extra cost there. But if you exclude that, we expect the Shipman well to be within the range. And then things like the dissolvable frac plugs, if that works, we can implement it on future wells across the whole well. That's roughly $700,000 savings that we haven't factored in yet. So very, very confident that we're going to be in the midpoint of that range over the next few wells and with still lots of opportunity to -- for improvement.

And so I do agree with your premise, and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be a work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we've chatted about before different investors from midstream and upstream, that is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time. And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price, and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float whether that's a good marker to be using for the midstream value at EQT. And I think we've also been pretty clear that we've got a notion that over time having more float out there is going to be a way to get more confidence level that that's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, although I noticed that it's now trading after the whole market has been -- had a tough period since its IPO of almost a year ago. It Is now trading just a little bit above its, just above its IPO price. I still think that, that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe and I think I've said this before that I fear that some of that is just kind of a sticker -- like a reverse sticker shock that folk's models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current yield is still -- that falls out of those calculations is a relatively low number. And there's a concern about bidding it up -- the price up such that, that current yield drops too much. But I think as you continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at the EQGP level, that will tend to go away, and that aspect of valuation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far some of those other issues that I mentioned, we do work through those issues. We do see it same way that you do, and we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's Conference Call. 
With me today are Dave Porges, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Schlotterbeck, President of EQT and President of Exploration and Production; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President of EQT and President of Midstream and Commercial; and Rob McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This call would be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. Eastern today. The telephone number for the replay is (201) 612-7415. The confirmation code is 13634047. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 10:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20 this morning. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's first quarter 2016 results. Next, Steve will give a Utica update. And finally, Dave will discuss certain market and strategic matters. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Randy and Rob will all be available to answer your questions. 
But first, I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and other risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations of most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally."
269924,330336333,966826,"EQT Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat. Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our price reconciliation and production segment page.

Before we begin the Q1 result, I want to review changes to our price reconciliation and production segment page. Historically, we presented the cost of gathering and transporting our gas as revenue deductions on the price reconciliation and production segment page. Starting today, gathering, transmission and processing costs are not reported as expenses on the production segment page. The exception is that transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. 
The new net marketing services line on the Production segment page includes these costs as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation. Previously, these capacity costs, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016 were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission cost on the price reconciliation, while the marketing recoveries, which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential. 
The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016 to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf. So netting these 2 charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. 
We've posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format. 
Now for an update on the remaining drop-down. We are currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop-down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there is about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million. As Pat mentioned, EQT GP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for the calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the second quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The high level of story for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment, with another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream. With the exception of a $3.8 million Huron restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks fairly brief. 
The story at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity costs in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices. 
Moving on to Midstream results. Operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million than (sic) [ higher than ] the first quarter of last year as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes the cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results in line with the median of wells drilled in the deep Utica by EQT and our peers so far. 
For the Utica to compete for capital with the Marcellus, we are targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well combined with the higher percentage of the EUR being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering compression costs should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus. 
We currently have 3 wells producing, the Scotts Run and Pettit wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania and the BIG-190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. The Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations, and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral. The results of the Pettit and BIG-190 wells, while not as strong as our Scotts Run well, are in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these 2 wells. 
The Shipman well was spud in January and is currently being fracked, while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the BIG-177. We used ceramic proppant on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the Pettit and BIG-190 wells, which used sand as the proppant. It is not clear that the proppant difference explains the results, but we have decided to use ceramic proppant in the next 3 completions, including the Shipman, to determine if the proppant type has an impact on well productivity. The good news is, we have negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic proppant since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400-foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run. 
On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling costs continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells. On the completion side, we will be testing dissolvable plug technology for the first time on the Shipman well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well if successful. Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well costs even with ceramic proppant. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the deep Utica. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Dave."

The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 246 gas equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. 
Since that February call, the gas equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014. We are beginning to see what appear to be some signs of a supply reduction as April U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those end 2014 rig counts probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggests that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increase continues to be uncertain. 
Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well positioned comparatively to adjust our development plans should higher prices materialize. I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessary to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment as we have been in the current less-than-constructive economic environment. 
On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position, but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining. If you look at our website for hard copy of our most recent investor presentations, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area, all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play. If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and not interested in looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area, again as defined by that rectangle in our current investor presentation. 
To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feet of pay in those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target. True synergies, if you will. 
My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholders baring the investment risk of employees portfolios via defined benefit pension plans. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, those many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade. As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We set about shrinking the plan over the years, and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to 0. 
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

So clearly, there's really 2 areas of focus, one is the size of the -- the drainage area size or the size of the box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir we don't have a lot of experience with yet, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there's still some questions about basically the density of the gas in the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with. So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels, so there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we're -- have a number of experiments and tests going on in both of those areas. But I would say it's -- bottom line is it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what a recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be and, in fact, what's really driving that extreme productivity we're seeing."

But we -- I think in this environment we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the upstream and the midstream than we probably would've expected a couple of years ago. And I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects. But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like, at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the upstream and the development of the midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure-play on one side or the other. And frankly, on the FERC regulated pipelines, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer-shippers are saying, and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where the -- having the synergies between the upstream and the midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder."

We don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and the reason we went with it on the first well is at these depths with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is we're pushing the upper limit of it. We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. And it's mostly due to crushing and/or embedment of the sand into the shale, mostly crushing that we are concerned about. So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand, but since that -- that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells, and the cost differential has been cut nearly in half. We thought it was wise to go back and see how much productivity difference that's driving."

So Neal had asked earlier, we are cutting a core on the Shipman well, so there'll be some extra cost there. But if you exclude that, we expect the Shipman well to be within the range.

And so I do agree with your premise, and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be a work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we've chatted about before different investors from midstream and upstream, that is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time. And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price, and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float whether that's a good marker to be using for the midstream value at EQT. And I think we've also been pretty clear that we've got a notion that over time having more float out there is going to be a way to get more confidence level that that's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, although I noticed that it's now trading after the whole market has been -- had a tough period since its IPO of almost a year ago. It Is now trading just a little bit above its, just above its IPO price. I still think that, that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe and I think I've said this before that I fear that some of that is just kind of a sticker -- like a reverse sticker shock that folk's models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current yield is still -- that falls out of those calculations is a relatively low number. And there's a concern about bidding it up -- the price up such that, that current yield drops too much. But I think as you continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at the EQGP level, that will tend to go away, and that aspect of valuation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far some of those other issues that I mentioned, we do work through those issues. We do see it same way that you do, and we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value."

Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. A portion of the proceeds were used upon the acquisition of 62,500 Marcellus acres and 53,000 net Utica acres primarily in Wetzel, Tyler and Harrison Counties of West Virginia for $407 million. The acquired acres include current natural gas production of approximately 50 million per day, which will add about 7 Bcf to our sales volume during the second half of the year. The acquisition also includes approximately 500 undeveloped locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with the EQT's existing development area. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2016 adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.35, down from adjusted loss of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by $32.7 million to $113.8 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we terminated the remaining vestiges of our defined benefit pension plan. As a result, we've recognized a loss of $9.4 million to earnings, $7.7 million, of which are attributable to midstream. In connection with the purchase of annuities, we made a cash payment of $5.4 million to fully fund the plan. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQGP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $77.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The high-level story for the second quarter was strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and the record gathering volumes at midstream. The second quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks brief. 
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volumes of 184.5 Bcf in the recently completed quarter was 26% higher than the second quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.11 per annum compared to $2.75 in the second quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's release. 
Net marketing revenues totaled $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, $7.7 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $516 million or $60.3 million higher quarter-over-quarter, including a $7.1 million legal reserve. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth although exploration expenses were lower for the quarter. 
Moving on to the midstream business. Operating income was $124.5 million, up 15% over the second quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $21.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at midstream were $89.8 million, $5.5 million higher of the same period last year, including the pension charge. On a per-unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 23% as a result of volumes growing faster than expenses. 
And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position, with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $2.2 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions from EQGP. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."
269924,372428259,1015232,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rob.

First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down from the 700 800 [ph] level that prevailed from mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that April call, the gas equivalent rig count has stabilized. It is up 4% since then of the gas-directed count itself exactly what it was back in with an increase of oil-directed rigs accounting for that small overall growth. If one assumes as we do, a 9- to 12-month lag between a rig arriving on site and gas flowing to a meter, the relevant relationship with the current gas equivalent rig count is down 47% versus 9 months ago and 53% versus 1 year ago. That leads to the impact of this on natural gas supply. In April, we were not yet sure we were seeing a decrease versus just noise, but July U.S. gas production is about 2.6 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. Though there were still noise in the system due to docks and other factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that we're seeing the impact of activity reduction that occurred throughout 2015. There further sharp reduction in activity versus 9 to 12 months ago are not yet showing up in these already lower production numbers. Still, the reductions we have seen, among other factors, have helped lift natural gas prices for the 5-year strip as I say 2017 through 2021 from a low of $2.63 per MMBtu in February to a current level of just over $3. This price is still below our estimated equilibrium price of about $3.25 to $3.5 per MMBtu. However, these somewhat rises, especially in the context of our expectation of further supply declines, has caused us to conclude that this is a good time to begin the process of restoring our pace of development, adding 63 incremental wells to our 2016 drilling program. Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reduction to the staff, we are well positioned to take advantage of the low service cost currently available to us. 
Another benefit of beginning this process now is that we have incremental takeaway capacity scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter this year, including 100 million cubic feet per day in the Gulf Coast with the TETCO Gulf Market Project and 650 million cubic feet per day on EQM's Ohio Valley Connector, which gets us to our capacity and ultimately to Midwest markets. While we always planned on an OBC in-service date before year-end 2016, the impending reality of that pipe becoming operational certainly adds confidence to a development increase that will result in incremental 2017 sales volumes. We're getting in front of the broader industry ramp-up, which we expect when gas prices improve further. We are focusing on our better prospects not returning to this [indiscernible] on to lesser Marcellus areas, for example, as our belief that the price recovery will continue is moderated by our somewhat rueful conclusion that inevitable overshoot of equilibrium prices will be followed by the equally inevitable overreaction in our industry. Though we do not think the industry overreaction will be as pronounced as it was a few years ago since there's likely to be more skepticism about the enduring nature of too much of an upward movement price, we still think the best place to position ourselves is to be amongst those companies who are moving a little bit lower earlier in the cycle in both directions. 
As a final note, where we are heading to the number of wells that we will spud in 2016, our CapEx forecast is unchanged. As you know, nearly 75% of the cost per well is per well completion. The majority of these incremental wells will be completed in 2017, so the CapEx related to completions will mostly be included in next year's CapEx budget. As for the CapEx that these new wells will incur in 2016, this increase is fully offset by the impact of lower service cost and improved drilling and completion efficiencies in the first half of 2016. For those of you who are starting to get a better feel for 2017 numbers, our preliminary estimate is that this increase in activity will cause our 2017 sales volumes to increase from the prior estimate of 750 to 760 Bcfe to a new estimate of roughly 800 to 810 Bcfe. We will refine those estimates later this year. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

My focus today is to provide an update on our Deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 were to get cost per well down to a target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results with EURs of approximately 3.5 Bcf per 1,000 feet. If we can achieve both, returns will be as good or better than our core Marcellus wells. 
Since the last call, we have one new data point to talk about. In June, we turned in line to shipment well in Greene County. Shipment was fraced with ceramic proppant versus the previous 2 wells that were fraced with sand. The IP showed improvement over the previous 2 Utica wells dependent on the BIG-190, our preliminary estimate is that the shipment EUR will be between 2 and 3 Bcf per thousand feet, which shows improvement from the padded and BIG-190. On the cost side, we've also made progress as the shipment well came in at approximately $14 million. We are pleased with our cost reductions thus far and see additional opportunities to further lower these costs. We're now estimating the cost per well in development mode to be between $12 million and $13 million. We continue to approach the Utica as an exploration project, trying various techniques, reviewing results, repeating what work and trying new things in our effort to improve results both on recoveries and cost. We are currently fracking the West Run Well in Greene County, and we're again utilizing ceramic proppant on this well. We expect to turn West Run in line in August. And after West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill the BIG-177 well in Wetzel County. We talked before about spudding 5 to 10 wells this year, and given the one-by-one nature of our program and our desire not to get ahead of the data, we expect that now closer to 5 wells for 2016. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress on the Deep Utica well, and I'll now turn the call over to Pat Kane."

And based on the results we're seeing, our tight curve is now 18% higher on an EUR per-foot basis, so the economics of Upper Devonian have improved. That's combined with approximately 14% lower well cost. And I would remind you that our view of the Upper Devonian is, it's basically a use-it or lose-it play. If we don't codevelop it at roughly the same time as the Marcellus, we think that reserve will effectively be lost. So when we look at the economics on the development of our resource base aspect versus just well-by-well economics, if we factor in these long-lateral, economic Upper Devonian wells and defer additional Marcellus wells for a time to make room for the Upper Devonian, we generate a lot more NPV versus drilling all Marcellus and foregoing the Upper Devonian forever. So -- and I guess the bottom line is the individual well returns for all of these Upper Devonian wells are well-above our cost of capital. So there are economic opportunities that otherwise would be lost if we don't capture them now."

Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering.",666,"Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of 62,500 net Marcellus acres and 53,000 net Utica acres primarily in Wetzel, Tyler and Harrison Counties of West Virginia for $407 million. The acquired acres include current natural gas production of approximately 50 million per day, which will add about 7 Bcf to our sales volume during the second half of the year. The acquisition also includes approximately 500 undeveloped locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2016 adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.35, down from the adjusted loss of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by $32.7 million to $113.8 million for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we terminated the remaining vestiges of our defined benefit pension plan. As a result, we've recognized the loss of $9.4 million to earnings, $7.7 million, of which are attributable to midstream. In connection with the purchase of annuities, we made a cash payment of $5.4 million to fully fund the plan. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $77.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The high-level story for the second quarter was strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and the record gathering volumes at midstream. The second quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks brief. 
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volumes of 184.5 Bcf in the recently completed quarter was 26% higher than the second quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.11 per annum compared to $2.75 in the second quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's release. 
Net marketing revenues totaled $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, $7.7 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $516 million or $60.3 million higher quarter-over-quarter, including a $7.1 million legal reserve. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth although exploration expenses were lower for the quarter. 
Moving on to the midstream business. Operating income was $124.5 million, up 15% over the second quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $21.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at midstream were $89.8 million, $5.5 million higher over the same period last year, including the pension charge. On a per-unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 23% as a result of volumes growing faster than expenses. 
Then, finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position, with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $2.2 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions from EQGP. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."
269924,372428259,1015450,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macroenvironment. First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down fr",789,"Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macroenvironment. 
First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down from the 700 to 800 grid level that prevailed from mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that April call, the gas equivalent rig count has stabilized. It is up 4% since then, though the gas-directed count itself is exactly what it was back then with an increase of oil-directed rigs accounting for that small overall growth. 
If one assumes as we do, a 9- to 12-month lag between a rig arriving on site and gas flowing through a meter, the relevant relationship with the current gas equivalent rig count is down 47% versus 9 months ago and 53% versus 1 year ago. That leads to the impact of this on natural gas supply. In April, we were not yet sure we were seeing a decrease versus just noise, but July U.S. gas production is about 2.6 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. 
Though there is still noise in the system due to docks and other factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that we are seeing the impact of activity reductions that occurred throughout 2015. There further sharp reduction in activity versus 9 to 12 months ago are not yet showing up in these already lower production numbers. 
Still, the reductions we have seen among other factors have helped lift natural gas prices for the 5-year strip as if to say 2017 through 2021 from a low of $2.63 per MMBtu in February to a current level of just over $3. This price is still below our estimated equilibrium price of about $3.25 to $3.5 per MMBtu. However, these somewhat higher prises, especially in the context of our expectation of further supply declines, have caused us to conclude that this is a good time to begin the process of restoring our pace of development, adding 63 incremental wells to our 2016 drilling program. Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reduction to the staff, we are well positioned to take advantage of the low service cost currently available to us. 
Another benefit of beginning this process now is that we have incremental takeaway capacity scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter this year, including 100 million cubic feet per day to the Gulf Coast with the TETCO Gulf Markets Project and 650 million cubic feet per day on EQM's Ohio Valley Connector, which gets us to our REX capacity and ultimately to Midwest markets. 
While we always planned on an OBC in-service date before year-end 2016, the impending reality of that pipe becoming operational certainly adds confidence to a development increase that will result in incremental 2017 sales volumes. We are getting in front of a broader industry ramp-up, which we expect when gas prices improve further. We are focusing on our better prospects, not returning to the Huron or to lesser, Marcellus areas, for example, as our belief that the price recovery will continue is moderated by our somewhat rueful conclusion that the inevitable overshoot of equilibrium prices will be followed by the equally inevitable overreaction in our industry. 
Though we do not think the industry overreaction will be as pronounced as it was a few years ago since there's likely to be more skepticism about the enduring nature of too much of an upward move in price, we still think the best place to position ourselves is to be amongst those companies that are moving a little bit earlier in the cycle in both directions. 
As a final note, where we are heading to the number of wells that we will spud in 2016, our CapEx forecast is unchanged. As you know, nearly 75% of the cost per well is for well completion. The majority of these incremental wells will be completed in 2017, so the CapEx related to completions will mostly be included in next year's CapEx budget. 
As for the CapEx that these new wells will incur in 2016, this increase is fully offset by the impact of lower service costs and improved drilling and completion efficiencies in the first half of 2016. For those of you who are starting to get a better feel for 2017 numbers, our preliminary estimate is that this increase in activity will cause our 2017 sales volumes to increase from the prior estimate of 750 to 760 Bcfe to a new estimate of roughly 800 to 810 Bcfe. We will refine those estimates later this year. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

My focus today is to provide an update on our Deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 were to get cost per well down to a target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results with EURs of approximately 3.5 Bcf per 1,000 feet. If we can achieve both, returns will be as good or better than our core Marcellus wells. 
Since the last call, we have one new data point to talk about. In June, we turned in line to shipment well in Greene County. Shipment was fracked with ceramic proppant versus the previous 2 wells that were fracked with sand. The IP showed improvement over the previous 2 Utica wells dependent in the BIG-190, our preliminary estimate is that the shipment EUR will be between 2 and 3 Bcf per thousand feet, which shows improvement from the Pettit and BIG-190. 
On the cost side, we've also made progress as the shipment well came in at approximately $14 million. We are pleased with our cost reductions thus far and see additional opportunities to further lower these costs. We're now estimating the cost per well in development mode to be between $12 million and $13 million. 
We continue to approach the Utica as an exploration project, trying various techniques, reviewing results, repeating what worked and trying new things in our effort to improve results both on recoveries and cost. We are currently fracking the West Run Well in Greene County, and we're again utilizing ceramic proppant on this well. We expect to turn West Run in line in August. And after West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill the BIG-177 well in Wetzel County. 
We talked before about spudding 5 to 10 wells this year, and given the one-by-one nature of our program and our desire not to get ahead of the data, we expect to end up closer to 5 wells for 2016. 
We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the Deep Utica well, and I'll now turn the call over to Pat Kane."

269924,372428259,1015450,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Neal, there's a number of factors that went into that decision, and a few of those are, since we discontinued the program about this time last year, we brought on 38 additional Upper Devonian wells that had been spud by that time. And based on the results",221,"Neal, there's a number of factors that went into that decision, and a few of those are, since we discontinued the program about this time last year, we brought on 38 additional Upper Devonian wells that had been spud by that time. And based on the results we're seeing, our tight curve is now 18% higher on an EUR per-foot basis, so the economics of Upper Devonian have improved. That's combined with approximately 14% lower well cost. And I would remind you that our view of the Upper Devonian is, it's basically a use-it or lose-it play. If we don't codevelop it at roughly the same time as the Marcellus, we think those -- that reserve will effectively be lost. So when we look at the economics on the development of our resource base aspect versus just well-by-well economics, if we factor in these long-lateral, economic Upper Devonian wells and defer additional Marcellus wells for a time to make room for the Upper Devonian, we generate a lot more NPV versus drilling all Marcellus and foregoing the Upper Devonian forever. So -- and I guess the bottom line is the individual well returns for all of these Upper Devonian wells are well-above our cost of capital. So they're economic opportunities that otherwise would be lost if we don't capture them now."

Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8.

Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of 62,500 net Marcellus acres and 53,000 net Utica acres primarily in Wetzel, Tyler and Harrison Counties of West Virginia for $407 million. The acquired acres include current natural gas production of approximately 50 million per day, which will add about 7 Bcf to our sales volume during the second half of the year. The acquisition also includes approximately 500 undeveloped locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2016 adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.35, down from the adjusted loss of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by $32.7 million to $113.8 million for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we terminated the remaining vestiges of our defined benefit pension plan. As a result, we've recognized the loss of $9.4 million to earnings, $7.7 million, of which are attributable to midstream. In connection with the purchase of annuities, we made a cash payment of $5.4 million to fully fund the plan. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $77.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The high-level story for the second quarter was strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at midstream. The second quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks brief. 
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volumes of 184.5 Bcf in the recently completed quarter was 26% higher than the second quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.11 per annum compared to $2.75 in the second quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's release. 
Net marketing revenues totaled $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, $7.7 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $516 million or $60.3 million higher quarter-over-quarter, including a $7.1 million legal reserve. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth although exploration expenses were lower for the quarter. 
Moving on to the midstream business. Operating income was $124.5 million, up 15% over the second quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $21.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at midstream were $89.8 million, $5.5 million higher over the same period last year, including the pension charge. On a per-unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 23% as a result of volumes growing faster than expenses. 
Then, finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position, with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $2.2 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions from EQGP. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."
269924,372428259,1015591,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macroenvironment. First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down fr",788,"Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macroenvironment. 
First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down from the 700 to 800 level that prevailed from mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that April call, the gas equivalent rig count has stabilized. It is up 4% since then, though the gas-directed count itself is exactly what it was back then with an increase of oil-directed rigs accounting for that small overall growth. 
If one assumes as we do, a 9- to 12-month lag between a rig arriving on site and gas flowing through a meter, the relevant relationship with the current gas equivalent rig count is down 47% versus 9 months ago and 53% versus 1 year ago. That leads to the impact of this on natural gas supply. In April, we were not yet sure we were seeing a decrease versus just noise, but July U.S. gas production is about 2.6 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. 
Though there is still noise in the system due to DUCs [ph] and other factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that we are seeing the impact of activity reductions that occurred throughout 2015. There further sharp reductions in activity versus 9 to 12 months ago are not yet showing up in these already lower production numbers. 
Still, the reductions we have seen among other factors have helped lift natural gas prices for the 5-year strip, that is to say 2017 through 2021 from a low of $2.63 per MMBtu in February to a current level of just over $3. This price is still below our estimated equilibrium price of about $3.25 to $3.50 per MMBtu. However, these somewhat higher prices, especially in the context of our expectation of further supply declines, have caused us to conclude that this is a good time to begin the process of restoring our pace of development, adding 63 incremental wells to our 2016 drilling program. Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we are well positioned to take advantage of the low service cost currently available to us. 
Another benefit of beginning this process now is that we have incremental takeaway capacity scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter this year, including 100 million cubic feet per day to the Gulf Coast with the TETCO Gulf Markets Project and 650 million cubic feet per day on EQM's Ohio Valley Connector, which gets us to our REX capacity and ultimately to Midwest markets. 
While we always planned on an OVC in-service date before year-end 2016, the impending reality of that pipe becoming operational certainly adds confidence to a development increase that will result in incremental 2017 sales volumes. We are getting in front of a broader industry ramp-up, which we expect when gas prices improve further. We are focusing on our better prospects, not returning to the Huron or to lesser Marcellus areas, for example, as our belief that the price recovery will continue is moderated by our somewhat rueful conclusion that the inevitable overshoot of equilibrium prices will be followed by the equally inevitable overreaction in our industry. 
Though we do not think the industry overreaction will be as pronounced as it was a few years ago since there's likely to be more skepticism about the enduring nature of too much of an upward move in price, we still think the best place to position ourselves is to be amongst those companies that are moving a little bit earlier in the cycle in both directions. 
As a final note, while we are adding to the number of wells that we will spud in 2016, our CapEx forecast is unchanged. As you know, nearly 75% of the cost per well is for well completion. The majority of these incremental wells will be completed in 2017, so the CapEx related to completions will mostly be included in next year's CapEx budget. 
As for the CapEx that these new wells will incur in 2016, this increase is fully offset by the impact of lower service costs and improved drilling and completion efficiencies in the first half of 2016. For those of you who are starting to get a better feel for 2017 numbers, our preliminary estimate is that this increase in activity will cause our 2017 sales volumes to increase from the prior estimate of 750 to 760 Bcfe to a new estimate of roughly 800 to 810 Bcfe. We will refine those estimates later this year. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

If we can achieve both, returns will be as good or better than our core Marcellus wells. 
Since the last call, we have one new data point to talk about. In June, we turned in line the shipment well in Greene County. Shipment was fracked with ceramic proppant versus the previous 2 wells that were fracked with sand. The IP showed improvement over the previous 2 Utica wells, the Pettit and the BIG-190. Our preliminary estimate is that the shipment EUR will be between 2 and 3 Bcf per thousand feet, which shows improvement from the Pettit and BIG-190. 
On the cost side, we've also made progress as the shipment well came in at approximately $14 million. We are pleased with our cost reductions thus far and see additional opportunities to further lower these costs. We're now estimating the cost per well in development mode to be between $12 million and $13 million. 
We continue to approach the Utica as an exploration project, trying various techniques, reviewing results, repeating what worked and trying new things in our effort to improve results both on recoveries and cost. We are currently fracking the West Run Well in Greene County, and we're again utilizing ceramic proppant on this well. We expect to turn West Run in line in August. And after West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill the BIG-177 well in Wetzel County. 
We talked before about spudding 5 to 10 wells this year, and given the one-by-one nature of our program and our desire not to get ahead of the data, we expect to end up closer to 5 wells for 2016. 
We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the Deep Utica and I'll now turn the call over to Pat Kane."

And based on the results we're seeing, our tight curve is now 18% higher on an EUR per-foot basis, so the economics of Upper Devonian have improved. That's combined with approximately 14% lower well cost. And I would remind you that our view of the Upper Devonian is, it's basically a use-it or lose-it play. If we don't co-develop it at roughly the same time as the Marcellus, we think those -- that reserve will effectively be lost. So when we look at the economics on the development of our resource base aspect versus just well-by-well economics, if we factor in these long-lateral, economic Upper Devonian wells and defer additional Marcellus wells for a time to make room for the Upper Devonian, we generate a lot more NPV versus drilling all Marcellus and foregoing the Upper Devonian forever. So -- and I guess the bottom line is the individual well returns for all of these Upper Devonian wells are well-above our cost of capital. So they're economic opportunities that otherwise would be lost if we don't capture them now."

Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering.",665,"Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of 62,500 net Marcellus acres and 53,000 net Utica acres primarily in Wetzel, Tyler and Harrison Counties of West Virginia for $407 million. The acquired acres include current natural gas production of approximately 50 million per day, which will add about 7 Bcf to our sales volume during the second half of the year. The acquisition also includes approximately 500 undeveloped locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. 
I will now provide a brief overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2016 adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.35, down from the adjusted loss of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by $32.7 million to $113.8 million for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we terminated the remaining vestiges of our defined benefit pension plan. As a result, we've recognized the loss of $9.4 million to earnings, $7.7 million, of which are attributable to midstream. In connection with the purchase of annuities, we made a cash payment of $5.4 million to fully fund the plan. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $77.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The high-level story for the second quarter was strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at midstream. The second quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks brief. 
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volumes of 184.5 Bcf in the recently completed quarter was 26% higher than the second quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.11 per annum compared to $2.75 in the second quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's release. 
Net marketing revenues totaled $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, $7.7 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity cost in 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $516 million or $60.3 million higher quarter-over-quarter, including a $7.1 million legal reserve. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth although exploration expenses were lower for the quarter. 
Moving on to the midstream business. Operating income was $124.5 million, up 15% over the second quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $21.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at midstream were $89.8 million, $5.5 million higher over the same period last year, including the pension charge. On a per-unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 23% as a result of volumes growing faster than expenses. 
Then, finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position, with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $2.2 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions from EQGP. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."
269924,372428259,1016544,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macroenvironment. First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down fr",787,"Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macroenvironment. 
First, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas equivalent rigs, down from the 700 to 800 level that prevailed from mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that April call, the gas equivalent rig count has stabilized. It is up 4% since then, though the gas-directed count itself is exactly what it was back then with an increase of oil-directed rigs accounting for that small overall growth. 
If one assumes as we do, a 9- to 12-month lag between a rig arriving on site and gas flowing through a meter, the relevant relationship with the current gas equivalent rig count is down 47% versus 9 months ago and 53% versus 1 year ago. That leads to the impact of this on natural gas supply. In April, we were not yet sure we were seeing a decrease versus just noise, but July U.S. gas production is about 2.6 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. 
Though there is still noise in the system due to DUC’s and other factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that we are seeing the impact of activity reductions that occurred throughout 2015. There further sharp reductions in activity versus 9 to 12 months ago are not yet showing up in these already lower production numbers. 
Still, the reductions we have seen among other factors have helped lift natural gas prices for the 5-year strip, that is to say 2017 through 2021 from a low of $2.63 per MMBtu in February to a current level of just over $3. This price is still below our estimated equilibrium price of about $3.25 to $3.50 per MMBtu. However, these somewhat higher prices, especially in the context of our expectation of further supply declines, have caused us to conclude that this is a good time to begin the process of restoring our pace of development, adding 63 incremental wells to our 2016 drilling program. Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we are well positioned to take advantage of the low service cost currently available to us. 
Another benefit of beginning this process now is that we have incremental takeaway capacity scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter this year, including 100 million cubic feet per day to the Gulf Coast with the TETCO Gulf Markets Project and 650 million cubic feet per day on EQM's Ohio Valley Connector, which gets us to our REX capacity and ultimately to Midwest markets. 
While we always planned on an OVC in-service date before year-end 2016, the impending reality of that pipe becoming operational certainly adds confidence to a development increase that will result in incremental 2017 sales volumes. We are getting in front of a broader industry ramp-up, which we expect when gas prices improve further. We are focusing on our better prospects, not returning to the Huron or to lesser Marcellus areas, for example, as our belief that the price recovery will continue is moderated by our somewhat rueful conclusion that the inevitable overshoot of equilibrium prices will be followed by the equally inevitable overreaction in our industry. 
Though we do not think the industry overreaction will be as pronounced as it was a few years ago since there's likely to be more skepticism about the enduring nature of too much of an upward move in price, we still think the best place to position ourselves is to be amongst those companies that are moving a little bit earlier in the cycle in both directions. 
As a final note, while we are adding to the number of wells that we will spud in 2016, our CapEx forecast is unchanged. As you know, nearly 75% of the cost per well is for well completion. The majority of these incremental wells will be completed in 2017, so the CapEx related to completions will mostly be included in next year's CapEx budget. 
As for the CapEx that these new wells will incur in 2016, this increase is fully offset by the impact of lower service costs and improved drilling and completion efficiencies in the first half of 2016. For those of you who are starting to get a better feel for 2017 numbers, our preliminary estimate is that this increase in activity will cause our 2017 sales volumes to increase from the prior estimate of 750 to 760 Bcfe to a new estimate of roughly 800 to 810 Bcfe. We will refine those estimates later this year. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

My focus today is to provide an update on our Deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 were to get cost per well down to a target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results with EUR",356,"Thank you, Dave. My focus today is to provide an update on our Deep Utica program. Our 2 objectives for 2016 were to get cost per well down to a target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results with EURs of approximately 3.5 Bcf per 1,000 feet. If we can achieve both, returns will be as good or better than our core Marcellus wells. 
Since the last call, we have one new data point to talk about. In June, we turned in line the shipment well in Greene County. Shipment was fracked with ceramic proppant versus the previous 2 wells that were fracked with sand. The IP showed improvement over the previous 2 Utica wells, the Pettit and the BIG-190. Our preliminary estimate is that the shipment EUR will be between 2 and 3 Bcf per thousand feet, which shows improvement from the Pettit and BIG-190. 
On the cost side, we've also made progress as the shipment well came in at approximately $14 million. We are pleased with our cost reductions thus far and see additional opportunities to further lower these costs. We're now estimating the cost per well in development mode to be between $12 million and $13 million. 
We continue to approach the Utica as an exploration project, trying various techniques, reviewing results, repeating what worked and trying new things in our effort to improve results both on recoveries and cost. We are currently fracking the West Run Well in Greene County, and we're again utilizing ceramic proppant on this well. We expect to turn West Run in line in August. And after West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill the BIG-177 well in Wetzel County. 
We talked before about spudding 5 to 10 wells this year, and given the one-by-one nature of our program and our desire not to get ahead of the data, we expect to end up closer to 5 wells for 2016. 
We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the Deep Utica and I'll now turn the call over to Pat Kane."

And based on the results we're seeing, our tight curve is now 18% higher on an EUR per-foot basis, so the economics of Upper Devonian have improved. That's combined with approximately 14% lower well cost. And I would remind you that our view of the Upper Devonian is, it's basically a use-it or lose-it play. If we don't co-develop it at roughly the same time as the Marcellus, we think those -- that reserve will effectively be lost. So when we look at the economics on the development of our resource base aspect versus just well-by-well economics, if we factor in these long-lateral, economic Upper Devonian wells and defer additional Marcellus wells for a time to make room for the Upper Devonian, we generate a lot more NPV versus drilling all Marcellus and foregoing the Upper Devonian forever. So -- and I guess the bottom line is the individual well returns for all of these Upper Devonian wells are well-above our cost of capital. So they're economic opportunities that otherwise would be lost if we don't capture them now."

269924,404024958,1063134,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing third quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering.

As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. At the time, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the approximately $412 million Statoil acquisition, with remaining proceeds to be used for another acquisition of similar size. On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of approximately 60,000 net Marcellus acres, which also includes 39,300 net Utica acres for $683 million. These acquisitions are consistent with the equity raise and will be paid for using those proceeds plus the proceeds from the latest drop-down to EQM.
The signing of the recently announced acquisitions, combined with the Statoil acquisition and a few smaller deals and leasing activity during the year, bring year-to-date committed investment in undeveloped acreage to approximately $1.2 billion and represent the most Marcellus under contract for acquisition by a single producer this year. These investments are consistent with our consolidation strategy and create value through purchasing undeveloped acreage while minimizing the amount paid for flowing production, which tends to be value-neutral. This year alone, for every 1 acre developed, 19 acres have been acquired. Our core Marcellus acreage has increased by 143,000 net acres or 55% and our undeveloped location inventory has increased to almost 3,700 locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. Therefore, the lateral lengths of 190 existing EQT locations can now be extended from approximately 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet on average. At a flat $250 realized gas price, the IRRs on these wells increased from approximately 9% to 37%.
Effective October 1, EQT completed the final drop of Midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included the Allegheny Valley Connector, a transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system that is currently being evaluated for potential sale, which should bring total proceeds above $300 million. As a reminder, the Huron Gathering system will be folded into EQT Production, and Midstream results will solely reflect the results of EQT Midstream Partners, which will still be consolidated into EQT Corporation's results.
I'll now give a brief overview of the quarter. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2016 adjusted loss of $0.26 per diluted share, which represents a $0.06 per share decline from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased by $19.3 million to $167.7 million for the quarter. EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $78.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $320 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the full year of 2016, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The operational story for the third quarter was strong volume growth in a low commodity price environment with another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record volumes at Midstream. The third quarter is very straightforward, so I will keep my remarks fairly brief.
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 196 Bcfe, which included 3.5 Bcfe from the Statoil acquisition, in the recently concluded quarter was 26% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.20 per Mcfe compared to $2.55 in the third quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's press release.
Net marketing service revenues totaled $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, which is relatively flat for the same period last year. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $524.6 million or $49.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes and exploration expenses were lower for the quarter.
Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter. Operating income was $132.7 million, up 17% over the third quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $15.8 million higher than the third quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $81.6 million, $4 million lower over the same period last year. On a per unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 17% as a result of higher volumes.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in great shape with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM or EQGP. Pro forma for the acquisitions I mentioned earlier and for the funds received from the drop to EQM, the cash balance would have been approximately $1.35 billion. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes about $150 million of distributions from EQGP.
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

I was going to talk about the Cubs, but Pat Kane discouraged me from doing so. So my only topic today pertains to my announcement of my intention to retire as CEO early next year and transition at that time to the role of Executive Chairman. It has been my honor to serve as an Executive Officer of EQT Corporation for nearly 19 years, including being CEO since early 2010. When my tenure as CEO began, EQT was already a well-run, shareholder value-focused company. However, it did seem appropriate to elevate the importance of our financial strategy for a period of time, and that was a central focus at my tenure. During this nearly 7 years as CEO, we have created additional value via the creation of 2 new public entities, several transactions between EQT and those entities, sales of noncore assets and acquisitions of assets complementary to our core business. We also raised efficient capital to fund our value-accretive growth and maintain a strong credit position through a very difficult time in our industry. Along the way, we made a variety of commitments to our investors, and I believe that the recently announced Midstream drop and upstream acquisitions are under the [ph] commitments we made.
That said, while financial strategy will always be important, it no longer needs to have the outsized role I had during much of my time as CEO. In a sense, therefore, I believe that my work here is done. 
On the personal side, as many of you are aware, I do have a variety of other interests, with my family being first amongst them, but various not-for-profit endeavors also being increasingly important to me. Even as we have achieved much of what I set out to accomplish as CEO, these other interests and priorities have exerted an increasing tug in my thoughts and energies as I look to make a difference in other ways.
Putting that another way, as much as I've enjoyed the past 19 years and as proud as I am at what we have accomplished at EQT, there are other things that I want to do with my life that are tough to do when one is a full-time executive in a publicly traded company. So no matter which way one looks at it, this is a good time to hand over the reins. Steve Schlotterbeck is well suited to be the next Chief Executive Officer. His pairing of strong analytical skills with the nurturing of a culture of innovation are just what the company needs as it moves into its next phase of value creation. These recent value-accretive acquisitions are clear example of this leadership, as are the combination of operational focus and scientific and technological innovation that he has brought to our company-wide focus on creating shareholder value. I'm confident he will do well and investors will do well with him at the helm.
Finally, I have actually enjoyed most of my interactions with investors and analysts. Thank you for your support and insights over the years.
And with that, I will turn it over to Steve."

I want to start by saying what a great honor it's been to be chosen to succeed Dave as CEO of EQT Corporation, and I'm humbled to be entrusted with the responsibility to lead this great organization forward. EQT's future is bright, thanks to the transformative leadership of Dave Porges. His vision, financial acumen and leadership abilities have fundamentally changed EQT, positioning us at the forefront of energy development and keeping us well positioned to face future challenges and opportunities for years to come.
EQT has endured one of the industry's most challenging periods of cyclical uncertainty, primarily because of our stringent focus on cost, our strong balance sheet and our uniquely integrated business structure. The combination of our outstanding upstream and midstream assets, together with strong financial management and operational nimbleness, will enable us to continue creating and delivering value for EQT shareholders. Maybe the most important reason I'm so confident in EQT's future is the strong and dedicated leadership of our board and executive team and the continued commitment of the most talented employees in the industry. This is an exciting time to be a part of this company and this industry, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
Now let's continue with a review of our recent core Marcellus acreage acquisitions and our current thoughts on our deep Utica program. Starting with our Marcellus acreage acquisitions. As Rob mentioned, we announced the acquisition of an additional 60,000 core Marcellus acres this week. Year-to-date, we have added 143,000 core acres, including 63,000 from Statoil and 20,000 through smaller deals and leasing efforts during the year. More importantly is that since 2013, we've added 230,000 core Marcellus acres. We've completed 477 wells over the same time period, developing 44,000 acres. The net result is an increase on our core undeveloped acreage of 106 -- 186,000 net acres or roughly 1,950 net incremental locations.
We've heard some of the rumors recently about inventory constraints at EQT. Simply put, we are not inventory constrained. We will continue to fill in gaps and look at bolt-on acquisitions. But with this week's acquisitions, we have achieved our near-term acreage acquisition goals.
Moving to the deep Utica. We continue to make progress on our deep Utica testing efforts. We are becoming more confident that we will achieve a combination of lower cost with higher EURs per foot that will result in similar, if not better economics to our core Marcellus economics. As we mentioned last quarter, we've already lowered cost down nearly to our target range of $12 million to $13 million per well. Based on our progress, we think that we'll reach our target range soon. We have also seen an improvement in productivity from changes we've made to our frac design on the last 2 wells. Given our well cost expectations, we think we need between 3 and 3.5 Bcf per thousand feet of pay [ph] to achieve returns which are competitive with our Marcellus opportunities. We're not there yet, but we aren't far off and are certainly encouraged by our progress.
Our current thinking is that you should expect a 1 rig deep Utica program in 2017, drilling between 6 and 8 wells. We believe this level of drilling will allow us to achieve our cost and productivity objectives as well as begin delineation of the economic extent of the deep Utica with a goal of establishing a deep Utica development program in 2018.
As far as progress reports, we believe it's in our shareholders' best interest not to share specifics of our techniques or results as we are currently the only company investing in the deep Utica. Before moving into development mode, we need to ensure that we can effectively move the gas, so we've been working closely with our Midstream group on gathering system designs. Based on pressures and the production profile of the deep Utica, our initial estimate is that per unit gathering cost for deep Utica would be about half that of the Marcellus.
In summary, we continue to make solid progress on both the cost and recovery efforts, and we are encouraged that the deep Utica can compete with or surpass our core Marcellus economics in the near future.
I'll now have the call over to Pat."

But I will say one of the main drivers behind all these acquisitions is our desire to extend laterals. And part of that then requires us to go re-permit a lot of the existing locations to take advantage of those synergies. So there is a bit of a delay before we get immediate benefits from the acquisitions. So it'll probably be mid-2017 before significant portion of our development program is incorporating the new acreage. We don't want to drill short laterals when we can take a few months and go back and re-permit and get the better economics. So you will start to see benefits from the acquisitions next year, but it'll probably be the back half of the year before we really get full speed ahead."

At the current time, we think we generate significant benefits from the ability to work the 2 businesses working together. I think we do have a view that over the long term, the benefits received from that versus the benefits of separation might be outweighed by separation. But I think certainly, in the short term, we continued to think that the combination of the 2 businesses makes the most sense for our shareholders. The second question around leverage and liquidity and how to spend, I think as you've seen through this downturn, we appreciate the value of a strong balance sheet. We've historically -- I think it's really a legacy from our utility days, but we've been an investment-grade-rated company. I think we continue to view that as valuable. So I think you'll see continued focus on keeping our balance sheet strong. I think we have a number of levers available to us to fund and help spend, if we think that's the prudent path forward. Particularly our large stake in EQGP is available to us to sell down the fund in ad spend. But I would say generally speaking, to grow at competitive rates does typically require a bit of an outspend. So I would think that's likely in the future, but all depends on what we think the economics of our opportunities are. So I think I'll leave it at that."

That said, one of the biggest value-creating opportunities we seem in Appalachia is the efficiencies we get from drilling longer laterals. So the acquisitions we've done to date are designed to allow us to drill longer laterals and get those efficiencies and drive the unit cost down. And to the extent that opportunities become available that fit our acreage well and allow us to gain those synergies, I think we'll continue to be interested. Subject to the comments I just made about liquidity and balance sheet strength, we're not going to stick our neck out to do that. But if there are opportunities to continue to put large blocks of acreage together, that allow us to drill longer laterals, then we would be interested in taking a look."

I think there's been less drilling there, and some of the competitive results may be a little bit less than a little bit further to the west. I can tell you, we drill in line 6 wells in Marion County in April of this year, and all 6 are exceeding their type curve from northern West Virginia. So I don't know if that's a result of the acreage we have. the Trans Energy acreage is directly connected to the acreage for those wells were, or if it's different completion techniques or exactly why, but as a result, we're very encouraged by that portion of Marion County, which I would imagine is probably where, if you're going to speculate on the acreage, that would be where the concerns might be.

But the one factor we have talked about in the past and I'll comment on is the type of proppant. We started with ceramics. We had a view that maybe sand would work and at that time would be significant cheaper than ceramics. We switched over. Those next couple of wells were significant underperformers from the Scotts Run. And then we switched back to ceramics with the last couple of wells, and they were significantly better than the wells with sand. And each subsequent -- those 2 wells have gotten as much closer to the target recoveries that we think we need. So I think ceramic, it does play a big role. Our third plan is to use ceramics for all wells in the future. Unfortunately, we've been also able to cut the of the ceramics basically in half from the first well, so that also helped on the economic side. Beyond that, I would say we have been doing a lot of technical work on our drilling completion techniques, the typical stuff you would think about, types of sand, loading schedules, pump rates, targeting, all that kind of stuff. And I think as we drill wells and learn more, just as we saw in the Marcellus, we're seeing continuous improvement. That's one of the reasons we want to spend the next year basically doing 1 well at a time, so we can try new techniques, learn from them, apply into the next well and not get too far over our schemes. We do think with another 6 or 8 wells, we'll be in a position where I think -- I'm confident we'll have the cost where they need to be. I'm pretty confident that the recoveries will get into that range that we think we need, and hopefully, we'll also have a chance to delineate the extent of the economic area of the Utica."

One thing I'll say is, we recently adopted a new standard frac design that uses considered more proppant per foot based on some very early test and a lot of reservoir modeling.

We probably won't increase our type curves until we have sufficient production history from a number of wells to confirm the results, and we just started that in a broader way 2, 3 months ago. So it'll take quite a few more months before we have wells online with production history. So if it plays out the way we expect, we would expect an increase in the type curve, but I don't think that's going to happen in the next couple of quarters."

269924,404024958,1063246,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing third quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering.

As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. At the time, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the approximately $412 million Statoil acquisition, with remaining proceeds to be used for another acquisition of similar size. On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of approximately 60,000 net Marcellus acres, which also includes 39,300 net Utica acres for $683 million. These acquisitions are consistent with the equity raise and will be paid for using those proceeds plus the proceeds from the latest drop-down to EQM.
The signing of the recently announced acquisitions, combined with the Statoil acquisition and a few smaller deals and leasing activity during the year, bring year-to-date committed investment in undeveloped acreage to approximately $1.2 billion and represent the most Marcellus under contract for acquisition by a single producer this year. These investments are consistent with our consolidation strategy and create value through purchasing undeveloped acreage while minimizing the amount paid for flowing production, which tends to be value-neutral. This year alone, for every 1 acre developed, 19 acres have been acquired. Our core Marcellus acreage has increased by 143,000 net acres or 55% and our undeveloped location inventory has increased to almost 3,700 locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. Therefore, the lateral lengths of 190 existing EQT locations can now be extended from approximately 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet on average. At a flat $250 realized gas price, the IRRs on these wells increased from approximately 9% to 37%.
Effective October 1, EQT completed the final drop of Midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included the Allegheny Valley Connector, a transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system that is currently being evaluated for potential sale, which should bring total proceeds above $300 million. As a reminder, the Huron Gathering system will be folded into EQT Production, and Midstream results will solely reflect the results of EQT Midstream Partners, which will still be consolidated into EQT Corporation's results.
I'll now give a brief overview of the quarter. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2016 adjusted loss of $0.26 per diluted share, which represents a $0.06 per share decline from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased by $19.3 million to $167.7 million for the quarter. EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $78.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $320 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the full year of 2016, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The operational story for the third quarter was strong volume growth in a low commodity price environment with another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record volumes at Midstream. The third quarter is very straightforward, so I will keep my remarks fairly brief.
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 196 Bcfe, which included 3.5 Bcfe from the Statoil acquisition, in the recently concluded quarter was 26% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.20 per Mcfe compared to $2.55 in the third quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's press release.
Net marketing service revenues totaled $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, which is relatively flat for the same period last year. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $524.6 million or $49.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes and exploration expenses were lower for the quarter.
Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter. Operating income was $132.7 million, up 17% over the third quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $15.8 million higher than the third quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $81.6 million, $4 million lower over the same period last year. On a per unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 17% as a result of higher volumes.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in great shape with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM or EQGP. Pro forma for the acquisitions I mentioned earlier and for the funds received from the drop to EQM, the cash balance would have been approximately $1.35 billion. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes about $150 million of distributions from EQGP.
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

I was going to talk about the Cubs, but Pat Kane discouraged me from doing so. So my only topic today pertains to my announcement of my intention to retire as CEO early next year and transition at that time to the role of Executive Chairman. It has been my honor to serve as an Executive Officer of EQT Corporation for nearly 19 years, including being CEO since early 2010. When my tenure as CEO began, EQT was already a well-run, shareholder value-focused company. However, it did seem appropriate to elevate the importance of our financial strategy for a period of time, and that was a central focus at my tenure. During this nearly 7 years as CEO, we have created additional value via the creation of 2 new public entities, several transactions between EQT and those entities, sales of noncore assets and acquisitions of assets complementary to our core business. We also raised efficient capital to fund our value-accretive growth and maintain a strong credit position through a very difficult time in our industry. Along the way, we made a variety of commitments to our investors, and I believe that the recently announced Midstream drop and upstream acquisitions are under the commitments we made.
That said, while financial strategy will always be important, it no longer needs to have the outsized role I had during much of my time as CEO. In a sense, therefore, I believe that my work here is done. 
On the personal side, as many of you are aware, I do have a variety of other interests, with my family being first amongst them, but various not-for-profit endeavors also being increasingly important to me. Even as we have achieved much of what I set out to accomplish as CEO, these other interests and priorities have exerted an increasing tug in my thoughts and energies as I look to make a difference in other ways.
Putting that another way, as much as I've enjoyed the past 19 years and as proud as I am at what we have accomplished at EQT, there are other things that I want to do with my life that are tough to do when one is a full-time executive in a publicly traded company. So no matter which way one looks at it, this is a good time to hand over the reins. Steve Schlotterbeck is well suited to be the next Chief Executive Officer. His pairing of strong analytical skills with the nurturing of a culture of innovation are just what the company needs as it moves into its next phase of value creation. These recent value-accretive acquisitions are clear example of this leadership, as are the combination of operational focus and scientific and technological innovation that he has brought to our company-wide focus on creating shareholder value. I'm confident he will do well and investors will do well with him at the helm.
Finally, I have actually enjoyed most of my interactions with investors and analysts. Thank you for your support and insights over the years.
And with that, I will turn it over to Steve."

I want to start by saying what a great honor it's been to be chosen to succeed Dave as CEO of EQT Corporation, and I'm humbled to be entrusted with the responsibility to lead this great organization forward. EQT's future is bright, thanks to the transformative leadership of Dave Porges. His vision, financial acumen and leadership abilities have fundamentally changed EQT, positioning us at the forefront of energy development and keeping us well positioned to face future challenges and opportunities for years to come.
EQT has endured one of the industry's most challenging periods of cyclical uncertainty, primarily because of our stringent focus on cost, our strong balance sheet and our uniquely integrated business structure. The combination of our outstanding upstream and midstream assets, together with strong financial management and operational nimbleness, will enable us to continue creating and delivering value for EQT shareholders. Maybe the most important reason I'm so confident in EQT's future is the strong and dedicated leadership of our board and executive team and the continued commitment of the most talented employees in the industry. This is an exciting time to be a part of this company and this industry, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
Now let's continue with a review of our recent core Marcellus acreage acquisitions and our current thoughts on our deep Utica program. Starting with our Marcellus acreage acquisitions. As Rob mentioned, we announced the acquisition of an additional 60,000 core Marcellus acres this week. Year-to-date, we have added 143,000 core acres, including 63,000 from Statoil and 20,000 through smaller deals and leasing efforts during the year. More importantly is that since 2013, we've added 230,000 core Marcellus acres. We've completed 477 wells over the same time period, developing 44,000 acres. The net result is an increase on our core undeveloped acreage of 106 -- 186,000 net acres or roughly 1,950 net incremental locations.
We've heard some of the rumors recently about inventory constraints at EQT. Simply put, we are not inventory constrained. We will continue to fill in gaps and look at bolt-on acquisitions. But with this week's acquisitions, we have achieved our near-term acreage acquisition goals.
Moving to the deep Utica. We continue to make progress on our deep Utica testing efforts. We are becoming more confident that we will achieve a combination of lower cost with higher EURs per foot that will result in similar, if not better economics to our core Marcellus economics. As we mentioned last quarter, we've already lowered cost down nearly to our target range of $12 million to $13 million per well. Based on our progress, we think that we'll reach our target range soon. We have also seen an improvement in productivity from changes we've made to our frac design on the last 2 wells. Given our well cost expectations, we think we need between 3 and 3.5 Bcf per thousand feet of pay to achieve returns which are competitive with our Marcellus opportunities. We're not there yet, but we aren't far off and are certainly encouraged by our progress.
Our current thinking is that you should expect a 1 rig deep Utica program in 2017, drilling between 6 and 8 wells. We believe this level of drilling will allow us to achieve our cost and productivity objectives as well as begin delineation of the economic extent of the deep Utica with a goal of establishing a deep Utica development program in 2018.
As far as progress reports, we believe it's in our shareholders' best interest not to share specifics of our techniques or results as we are currently the only company investing in the deep Utica. Before moving into development mode, we need to ensure that we can effectively move the gas, so we've been working closely with our Midstream group on gathering system designs. Based on pressures and the production profile of the deep Utica, our initial estimate is that per unit gathering cost for deep Utica would be about half that of the Marcellus.

But I will say one of the main drivers behind all these acquisitions is our desire to extend laterals. And part of that then requires us to go re-permit a lot of the existing locations to take advantage of those synergies. So there is a bit of a delay before we get immediate benefits from the acquisitions. So it'll probably be mid-2017 before significant portion of our development program is incorporating the new acreage. We don't want to drill short laterals when we can take a few months and go back and re-permit and get the better economics. So you will start to see benefits from the acquisitions next year, but it'll probably be the back half of the year before we really get full speed ahead."

But I think, certainly, in the short term, we continue to think that the combination of the 2 businesses makes the most sense for our shareholders. The second question around leverage and liquidity and outspend, I think as you've seen through this downturn, we appreciate the value of a strong balance sheet. We've historically -- I think it's really a legacy from our utility days, but we've been an investment-grade-rated company. I think we continue to view that as valuable. So I think you'll see continued focus on keeping our balance sheet strong. I think we have a number of levers available to us to fund an outspend if we think that's the prudent path forward. Particularly the -- our large stake in EQGP is available to us to sell down to fund an outspend.

Specifically, because I think I've seen a question or 2 about Marion County, I think there's been less drilling there. And some of the competitive results may be or a little bit less than a little bit further to the west. I can tell you, we turned in line 6 wells in Marion County in April of this year, and all 6 are exceeding our type curve for Northern West Virginia. So I don't know if that's a result of the acreage we have, and the Trans Energy acreage is directly connected to the acreage where those wells were; or if it's different completion techniques or exactly why.

As I said, we don't want to give out any specifics on what we're doing since, right now, I think we're the only company, perhaps one other is, is investing a little bit in the deep Utica. But the one factor we have talked about in the past and I'll comment on is the type of proppant. We started with ceramics. We had a view that maybe sand would work and at that time would be significantly cheaper than ceramics. We switched over. Those next couple wells were significant underperformers from the Scotts Run. And then we switched back to ceramics for the last couple wells, and they were significantly better than the wells with sand. And each subsequent -- those 2 wells have gotten as much closer to the target recoveries that we think we need. So I think ceramic does play a big role. Our current plan is to use ceramics for all wells in the future. And fortunately, we've also been able to cut the cost of the ceramics basically in half from the first well, so that also helped on the economic side. Beyond that, I will say we have been doing a lot of technical work on our drilling and completion techniques, the typical stuff you would think about, types of sand, loading schedules, pump rates, targeting and the reservoir, all that kind of stuff. And I think as we drill wells and learn more, just as we saw in the Marcellus, we're seeing continuous improvement. That's one of the reasons we want to spend the next year basically doing 1 well at a time, so we can try new techniques, learn from them, apply into the next well and not get too far over our skis. But we do think with another 6 or 8 wells, we'll be in a position where I think we'll have -- I'm confident we'll have the cost where they need to be. I'm pretty confident that the recoveries will get into that range that we think we need. And hopefully, we'll also have a chance to delineate the extent of the economic area of the Utica."

269924,404024958,1063439,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing third quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering.

As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. At the time, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the approximately $412 million Statoil acquisition, with remaining proceeds to be used for another acquisition of similar size. On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of approximately 60,000 net Marcellus acres, which also includes 39,300 net Utica acres for $683 million. These acquisitions are consistent with the equity raised and will be paid for using those proceeds plus the proceeds from the latest drop-down to EQM.
The signing of the recently announced acquisitions, combined with the Statoil acquisition and a few smaller deals and leasing activity during the year bring year-to-date committed investment in undeveloped acreage to approximately $1.2 billion and represent the most Marcellus under contract for acquisition by a single producer this year. These investments are consistent with our consolidation strategy and create value through purchasing undeveloped acreage while minimizing the amount paid for flowing production, which tends to be value neutral. This year alone, for every 1 acre developed, 19 acres have been acquired. Our core Marcellus acreage has increased by 143,000 net acres or 55%, and our undeveloped location inventory has increased to almost 3,700 locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. Therefore, the lateral lengths of 190 existing EQT locations can now be extended from approximately 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet on average. At a flat $250 realized gas price, the IRRs on these wells increased from approximately 9% to 37%.
Effective October 1, EQT completed the final drop of Midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included the Allegheny Valley Connector, a transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system that is currently being evaluated for potential sale, which should bring total proceeds above $300 million. As a reminder, the Huron Gathering system will be folded into EQT Production, and Midstream results will solely reflect the results of EQT Midstream Partners, which will still be consolidated into EQT Corporation's results.
I'll now give a brief overview of the quarter. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2016 adjusted loss of $0.26 per diluted share, which represents a $0.06 per share decline from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased by $19.3 million to $167.7 million for the quarter. EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $78.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $320 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the full year of 2016, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The operational story for the third quarter was strong volume growth in a low commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record volumes at Midstream. The third quarter is very straightforward, so I will keep my remarks fairly brief.
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 196 Bcfe, which included 3.5 Bcfe from the Statoil acquisition, in the recently concluded quarter was 26% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.20 per Mcfe compared to $2.55 in the third quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's press release.
Net marketing service revenues totaled $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, which is relatively flat for the same period last year. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $524.6 million or $49.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes and exploration expenses were lower for the quarter.
Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter. Operating income was $132.7 million, up 17% over the third quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $15.8 million higher than the third quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $81.6 million, $4 million lower over the same period last year. On a per unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 17% as a result of higher volumes.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in great shape with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM or EQGP. Pro forma for the acquisitions I mentioned earlier and for the funds received from the drop to EQM, the cash balance would have been approximately $1.35 billion. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes about $150 million of distributions from EQGP.
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

I was going to talk about the Cubs, but Pat Kane discouraged me from doing so. So my only topic today pertains to my announcement of my intention to retire as CEO early next year and transition at that time to the role of Executive Chairman. It has been my honor to serve as an Executive Officer of EQT Corporation for nearly 19 years, including being CEO since early 2010. When my tenure as CEO began, EQT was already a well-run, shareholder value-focused company. However, it did seem appropriate to elevate the importance of our financial strategy for a period of time, and that was a central focus of my tenure. During these nearly 7 years as CEO, we have created additional value via the creation of 2 new public entities, several transactions between EQT and those entities, sales of noncore assets and acquisitions of assets complementary to our core business. We also raised efficient capital to fund our value-accretive growth and maintained a strong credit position through a very difficult time in our industry. Along the way, we made a variety of commitments to our investors, and I believe that the recently announced Midstream drop and upstream acquisitions honor the commitments that we made.
That said, while financial strategy will always be important, it no longer needs to have the outsized role it had during much of my time as CEO. In a sense, therefore, I believe that my work here is done. 
On the personal side, as many of you are aware, I do have a variety of other interests, with my family being first amongst them, but various not-for-profit endeavors also being increasingly important to me. Even as we have achieved much of what I set out to accomplish as CEO, these other interests and priorities have exerted an increasing tug in my thoughts and energies as I look to make a difference in other ways.
Putting that another way, as much as I've enjoyed the past 19 years and as proud as I am at what we have accomplished at EQT, there are other things that I want to do with my life that are tough to do when one is a full-time executive in a publicly traded company. So no matter which way one looks at it, this is a good time to hand over the reins. Steve Schlotterbeck is well suited to be the next Chief Executive Officer. His pairing of strong analytical skills with the nurturing of a culture of innovation are just what the company needs as it moves into its next phase of value creation. These recent value-accretive acquisitions are clear example of his leadership, as are the combination of operational focus and scientific and technological innovation that he has brought to our company-wide focus on creating shareholder value. I'm confident he will do well and investors will do well with him at the helm.
Finally, I have actually enjoyed most of my interactions with investors and analysts. Thank you for your support and insights over the years.
And with that, I will turn it over to Steve."

I want to start by saying what a great honor it's been to be chosen to succeed Dave as CEO of EQT Corporation, and I'm humbled to be entrusted with the responsibility to lead this great organization forward. EQT's future is bright, thanks to the transformative leadership of Dave Porges. His vision, financial acumen and leadership abilities have fundamentally changed EQT, positioning us at the forefront of energy development and keeping us well positioned to face future challenges and opportunities for years to come.
EQT has endured one of the industry's most challenging periods of cyclical uncertainty, primarily because of our stringent focus on cost, our strong balance sheet and our uniquely integrated business structure. The combination of our outstanding upstream and midstream assets, together with strong financial management and operational nimbleness, will enable us to continue creating and delivering value for EQT shareholders. Maybe the most important reason I'm so confident in EQT's future is the strong and dedicated leadership of our board and executive team and the continued commitment of the most talented employees in the industry. This is an exciting time to be a part of this company and this industry, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
Now let's continue with a review of our recent core Marcellus acreage acquisitions and our current thoughts on our deep Utica program. Starting with our Marcellus acreage acquisitions. As Rob mentioned, we announced the acquisition of an additional 60,000 core Marcellus acres this week. Year-to-date, we have added 143,000 core acres, including 63,000 from Statoil and 20,000 through smaller deals and leasing efforts during the year. More importantly is that since 2013 we've added 230,000 core Marcellus acres. We've completed 477 wells over this same time period, developing 44,000 acres. The net result is an increase on our core undeveloped acreage of 106 -- 186,000 net acres or roughly 1,950 net incremental locations.
We've heard some of the rumors recently about inventory constraints at EQT. Simply put, we are not inventory constrained. We will continue to fill in gaps and look at bolt-on acquisitions. But with this week's acquisitions, we have achieved our near-term acreage acquisition goals.
Moving to the deep Utica. We continue to make progress on our deep Utica testing efforts. We are becoming more confident that we will achieve a combination of lower cost with higher EURs per foot that will result in similar if not better economics to our core Marcellus economics. As we mentioned last quarter, we've already lowered cost down nearly to our target range of $12 million to $13 million per well. Based on our progress, we think that we'll reach our target range soon. We have also seen an improvement in productivity from changes we've made to our frac design on the last 2 wells. Given our well cost expectations, we think we need between 3 and 3.5 Bcf per thousand feet of pay to achieve returns which are competitive with our Marcellus opportunities. We're not there yet, but we aren't far off and are certainly encouraged by our progress.
Our current thinking is that you should expect a 1-rig deep Utica program in 2017, drilling between 6 and 8 wells. We believe this level of drilling will allow us to achieve our cost and productivity objectives as well as begin delineation of the economic extent of the deep Utica, with a goal of establishing a deep Utica development program in 2018.
As far as progress reports, we believe it's in our shareholders' best interest not to share specifics of our techniques or results, as we are currently the only company investing in the deep Utica. Before moving into development mode, we need to ensure that we can effectively move the gas, so we've been working closely with our Midstream group on gathering system designs. Based on pressures and the production profile of the deep Utica, our initial estimate is that per unit gathering cost for deep Utica would be about half that of the Marcellus.
In summary, we continue to make solid progress on both the cost and recovery efforts, and we are encouraged that the deep Utica can compete with or surpass our core Marcellus economics in the near future.
I'll now have the call over to Pat."

And we will allocate capital based on the best returns available starting in our 2017 plan, which we'll talk about in December. But I will say one of the main drivers behind all these acquisitions is our desire to extend laterals. And part of that then requires us to go re-permit a lot of the existing locations to take advantage of those synergies. So there is a bit of a delay before we get immediate benefits from the acquisitions. So it'll probably be mid-2017 before significant portion of our development program is incorporating the new acreage. We don't want to drill short laterals when we can take a few months and go back and re-permit and get the better economics. So you will start to see benefits from the acquisitions next year, but it'll probably be the back half of the year before we really get full speed ahead."

I think we do have a view that over the long term the benefits received from that versus the benefits of separation might be outweighed by separation. But I think, certainly, in the short term, we continue to think that the combination of the 2 businesses makes the most sense for our shareholders. The second question around leverage and liquidity and outspend, I think as you've seen through this downturn we appreciate the value of a strong balance sheet. We've historically -- I think it's really a legacy from our utility days, but we've been an investment-grade-rated company. I think we continue to view that as valuable. So I think you'll see continued focus on keeping our balance sheet strong. I think we have a number of levers available to us to fund an outspend if we think that's the prudent path forward. Particularly the -- our large stake in EQGP is available to us to sell down to fund an outspend. But I would say generally speaking, to grow at competitive rates does typically require a bit of an outspend. So I would think that's likely in the future, but all depends on what we think the economics of our opportunities are. So I think I'll leave it at that."

That said, one of the biggest value-creating opportunities we see in Appalachia is the efficiencies we get from drilling longer laterals. So the acquisitions we've done to date are designed to allow us to drill longer laterals and get those efficiencies and drive the unit cost down. And to the extent that opportunities become available that fit our acreage well and allow us to gain those synergies, I think we'll continue to be interested. Subject to the comments I just made about liquidity and balance sheet strength, we're not going to stick our neck out to do that.

Specifically, Statoil and Trans Energy are West Virginia focused -- or all in West Virginia, all very connected to the acreage we already have in Wetzel and Marion Counties and Tyler County and we think very consistent with the results we've seen down there. Specifically, because I think I've seen a question or 2 about Marion County, I think there's been less drilling there. And some of the competitive results may be a little bit less and a little bit further to the west. I can tell you, we turned in line 6 wells in Marion County in April of this year, and all 6 are exceeding our type curve for Northern West Virginia. So I don't know if that's a result of the acreage we have, and the Trans Energy acreage is directly connected to the acreage where those wells were, or if it's different completion techniques or exactly why.

As I said, we don't want to give out any specifics on what we're doing since right now we're -- I think we're the only company, perhaps one other is, is investing a little bit in the deep Utica. But the one factor we have talked about in the past and I'll comment on is the type of proppant. We started with ceramics. We had a view that maybe sand would work and at that time would be significantly cheaper than ceramics. We switched over. Those next couple wells were significant underperformers from the Scotts Run. And then we switched back to ceramics for the last couple wells, and they were significantly better than the wells with sand. And each subsequent -- those 2 wells have gotten us much closer to the target recoveries that we think we need. So I think ceramic did -- does play a big role. Our current plan is to use ceramics for all wells in the future. And fortunately, we've also been able to cut the cost of the ceramics basically in half from the first well, so that also helped on the economic side. Beyond that, I will say we have been doing a lot of technical work on our drilling completion techniques, the typical stuff you would think about, types of sand, loading schedules, pump rates, targeting and the reservoir, all that kind of stuff. And I think as we drill wells and learn more, just as we saw in the Marcellus, we're seeing continuous improvement. That's one of the reasons we want to spend the next year basically doing 1 well at a time, so we can try new techniques, learn from them, apply them to the next well and not get too far over our skis. But we do think with another 6 or 8 wells we'll be in a position where I think we'll have -- I'm confident we'll have the cost where they need to be. I'm pretty confident that the recoveries will get into that range that we think we need. And hopefully, we'll also have a chance to delineate the extent of the economic area of the Utica."

As a reminder, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. At the time, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the approximately $412 million Statoil acquisition, with remaining proceeds to be used for another acquisition of similar size. On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of approximately 60,000 net Marcellus acres, which also includes 39,300 net Utica acres for $683 million. These acquisitions are consistent with the equity raised and will be paid for using those proceeds plus the proceeds from the latest drop-down to EQM.
The signing of the recently announced acquisitions, combined with the Statoil acquisition and a few smaller deals and leasing activity during the year bring year-to-date committed investment in undeveloped acreage to approximately $1.2 billion and represent the most Marcellus under contract for acquisition by a single producer this year. These investments are consistent with our consolidation strategy and create value through purchasing undeveloped acreage while minimizing the amount paid for flowing production, which tends to be value neutral. This year alone, for every 1 acre developed, 19 acres have been acquired. Our core Marcellus acreage has increased by 143,000 net acres or 55%, and our undeveloped location inventory has increased to almost 3,700 locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. Therefore, the lateral lengths of 190 existing EQT locations can now be extended from approximately 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet on average. At a flat $250 realized gas price, the IRRs on these wells increased from approximately 9% to 37%.
Effective October 1, EQT completed the final drop of Midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included the Allegheny Valley Connector, a transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system that is currently being evaluated for potential sale, which should bring total proceeds above $300 million. As a reminder, the Huron Gathering system will be folded into EQT Production, and Midstream results will solely reflect the results of EQT Midstream Partners, which will still be consolidated into EQT Corporation's results.
I'll now give a brief overview of the quarter. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2016 adjusted loss of $0.26 per diluted share, which represents a $0.06 per share decline from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased by $19.3 million to $167.7 million for the quarter. EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $78.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $320 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the full year of 2016, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance. The operational story for the third quarter was strong volume growth in a low commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record volumes at Midstream. The third quarter is very straightforward, so I will keep my remarks fairly brief.
EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 196 Bcfe, which included 3.5 Bcfe from the Statoil acquisition, in the recently concluded quarter was 26% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.20 per Mcfe compared to $2.55 in the third quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's press release.
Net marketing service revenues totaled $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, which is relatively flat for the same period last year. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $524.6 million or $49.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes and exploration expenses were lower for the quarter.
Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter. Operating income was $132.7 million, up 17% over the third quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $15.8 million higher than the third quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $81.6 million, $4 million lower over the same period last year. On a per unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 17% as a result of higher volumes.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in great shape with 0 short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM or EQGP. Pro forma for the acquisitions I mentioned earlier and for the funds received from the drop to EQM, the cash balance would have been approximately $1.35 billion. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes about $150 million of distributions from EQGP.
With that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

I was going to talk about the Cubs, but Pat Kane discouraged me from doing so. So my only topic today pertains to my announcement of my intention to retire as CEO early next year and transition at that time to the role of Executive Chairman. It has been my honor to serve as an Executive Officer of EQT Corporation for nearly 19 years, including being CEO since early 2010. When my tenure as CEO began, EQT was already a well-run, shareholder value-focused company. However, it did seem appropriate to elevate the importance of our financial strategy for a period of time, and that was a central focus of my tenure. During these nearly 7 years as CEO, we have created additional value via the creation of 2 new public entities, several transactions between EQT and those entities, sales of noncore assets and acquisitions of assets complementary to our core business. We also raised efficient capital to fund our value-accretive growth and maintained a strong credit position through a very difficult time in our industry. Along the way, we made a variety of commitments to our investors, and I believe that the recently announced Midstream drop and upstream acquisitions honor the commitments that we made.
That said, while financial strategy will always be important, it no longer needs to have the outsized role it had during much of my time as CEO. In a sense, therefore, I believe that my work here is done. 
On the personal side, as many of you are aware, I do have a variety of other interests, with my family being first amongst them, but various not-for-profit endeavors also being increasingly important to me. Even as we have achieved much of what I set out to accomplish as CEO, these other interests and priorities have exerted an increasing tug in my thoughts and energies as I look to make a difference in other ways.
Putting that another way, as much as I've enjoyed the past 19 years and as proud as I am at what we have accomplished at EQT, there are other things that I want to do with my life that are tough to do when one is a full-time executive in a publicly traded company. So no matter which way one looks at it, this is a good time to hand over the reins. Steve Schlotterbeck is well suited to be the next Chief Executive Officer. His pairing of strong analytical skills with the nurturing of a culture of innovation are just what the company needs as it moves into its next phase of value creation. These recent value-accretive acquisitions are clear example of his leadership, as are the combination of operational focus and scientific and technological innovation that he has brought to our company-wide focus on creating shareholder value. I'm confident he will do well and investors will do well with him at the helm.
Finally, I have actually enjoyed most of my interactions with investors and analysts. Thank you for your support and insights over the years.
And with that, I will turn it over to Steve."

I want to start by saying what a great honor it's been to be chosen to succeed Dave as CEO of EQT Corporation, and I'm humbled to be entrusted with the responsibility to lead this great organization forward. EQT's future is bright, thanks to the transformative leadership of Dave Porges. His vision, financial acumen and leadership abilities have fundamentally changed EQT, positioning us at the forefront of energy development and keeping us well positioned to face future challenges and opportunities for years to come.
EQT has endured one of the industry's most challenging periods of cyclical uncertainty, primarily because of our stringent focus on cost, our strong balance sheet and our uniquely integrated business structure. The combination of our outstanding upstream and midstream assets, together with strong financial management and operational nimbleness, will enable us to continue creating and delivering value for EQT shareholders. Maybe the most important reason I'm so confident in EQT's future is the strong and dedicated leadership of our board and executive team and the continued commitment of the most talented employees in the industry. This is an exciting time to be a part of this company and this industry, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
Now let's continue with a review of our recent core Marcellus acreage acquisitions and our current thoughts on our deep Utica program. Starting with our Marcellus acreage acquisitions. As Rob mentioned, we announced the acquisition of an additional 60,000 core Marcellus acres this week. Year-to-date, we have added 143,000 core acres, including 63,000 from Statoil and 20,000 through smaller deals and leasing efforts during the year. More importantly is that since 2013 we've added 230,000 core Marcellus acres. We've completed 477 wells over this same time period, developing 44,000 acres. The net result is an increase on our core undeveloped acreage of 106 -- 186,000 net acres or roughly 1,950 net incremental locations.
We've heard some of the rumors recently about inventory constraints at EQT. Simply put, we are not inventory constrained. We will continue to fill in gaps and look at bolt-on acquisitions. But with this week's acquisitions, we have achieved our near-term acreage acquisition goals.
Moving to the deep Utica. We continue to make progress on our deep Utica testing efforts. We are becoming more confident that we will achieve a combination of lower cost with higher EURs per foot that will result in similar if not better economics to our core Marcellus economics. As we mentioned last quarter, we've already lowered cost down nearly to our target range of $12 million to $13 million per well. Based on our progress, we think that we'll reach our target range soon. We have also seen an improvement in productivity from changes we've made to our frac design on the last 2 wells. Given our well cost expectations, we think we need between 3 and 3.5 Bcf per thousand feet of pay to achieve returns which are competitive with our Marcellus opportunities. We're not there yet, but we aren't far off and are certainly encouraged by our progress.
Our current thinking is that you should expect a 1-rig deep Utica program in 2017, drilling between 6 and 8 wells. We believe this level of drilling will allow us to achieve our cost and productivity objectives as well as begin delineation of the economic extent of the deep Utica, with a goal of establishing a deep Utica development program in 2018.
As far as progress reports, we believe it's in our shareholders' best interest not to share specifics of our techniques or results, as we are currently the only company investing in the deep Utica. Before moving into development mode, we need to ensure that we can effectively move the gas, so we've been working closely with our Midstream group on gathering system designs. Based on pressures and the production profile of the deep Utica, our initial estimate is that per unit gathering cost for deep Utica would be about half that of the Marcellus.
In summary, we continue to make solid progress on both the cost and recovery efforts, and we are encouraged that the deep Utica can compete with or surpass our core Marcellus economics in the near future.
I'll now have the call over to Pat."

And we will allocate capital based on the best returns available starting in our 2017 plan, which we'll talk about in December. But I will say one of the main drivers behind all these acquisitions is our desire to extend laterals. And part of that then requires us to go re-permit a lot of the existing locations to take advantage of those synergies. So there is a bit of a delay before we get immediate benefits from the acquisitions. So it'll probably be mid-2017 before significant portion of our development program is incorporating the new acreage. We don't want to drill short laterals when we can take a few months and go back and re-permit and get the better economics. So you will start to see benefits from the acquisitions next year, but it'll probably be the back half of the year before we really get full speed ahead."

But I think, certainly, in the short term, we continue to think that the combination of the 2 businesses makes the most sense for our shareholders. The second question around leverage and liquidity and outspend, I think as you've seen through this downturn we appreciate the value of a strong balance sheet. We've historically -- I think it's really a legacy from our utility days, but we've been an investment-grade-rated company. I think we continue to view that as valuable. So I think you'll see continued focus on keeping our balance sheet strong. I think we have a number of levers available to us to fund an outspend if we think that's the prudent path forward. Particularly the -- our large stake in EQGP is available to us to sell down to fund an outspend. But I would say generally speaking, to grow at competitive rates does typically require a bit of an outspend. So I would think that's likely in the future, but all depends on what we think the economics of our opportunities are. So I think I'll leave it at that."

So the acquisitions we've done to date are designed to allow us to drill longer laterals and get those efficiencies and drive the unit cost down.

Specifically, because I think I've seen a question or 2 about Marion County, I think there's been less drilling there. And some of the competitive results may be a little bit less and a little bit further to the west. I can tell you, we turned in line 6 wells in Marion County in April of this year, and all 6 are exceeding our type curve for Northern West Virginia. So I don't know if that's a result of the acreage we have, and the Trans Energy acreage is directly connected to the acreage where those wells were, or if it's different completion techniques or exactly why.

As I said, we don't want to give out any specifics on what we're doing since right now we're -- I think we're the only company, perhaps one other is, is investing a little bit in the deep Utica. But the one factor we have talked about in the past and",363,"Yes. As I said, we don't want to give out any specifics on what we're doing since right now we're -- I think we're the only company, perhaps one other is, is investing a little bit in the deep Utica. But the one factor we have talked about in the past and I'll comment on is the type of proppant. We started with ceramics. We had a view that maybe sand would work and at that time would be significantly cheaper than ceramics. We switched over. Those next couple wells were significant underperformers from the Scotts Run. And then we switched back to ceramics for the last couple wells, and they were significantly better than the wells with sand. And each subsequent -- those 2 wells have gotten us much closer to the target recoveries that we think we need. So I think ceramic did -- does play a big role. Our current plan is to use ceramics for all wells in the future. And fortunately, we've also been able to cut the cost of the ceramics basically in half from the first well, so that also helped on the economic side. Beyond that, I will say we have been doing a lot of technical work on our drilling completion techniques, the typical stuff you would think about, types of sand, loading schedules, pump rates, targeting and the reservoir, all that kind of stuff. And I think as we drill wells and learn more, just as we saw in the Marcellus, we're seeing continuous improvement. That's one of the reasons we want to spend the next year basically doing 1 well at a time, so we can try new techniques, learn from them, apply them to the next well and not get too far over our skis. But we do think with another 6 or 8 wells we'll be in a position where I think we'll have -- I'm confident we'll have the cost where they need to be. I'm pretty confident that the recoveries will get into that range that we think we need. And hopefully, we'll also have a chance to delineate the extent of the economic area of the Utica."

One thing I'll say is we recently adopted a new standard frac design that uses considerably more proppant per foot based on some very early test and a lot of reservoir modeling. We do expect this new technique to yield higher NPV per acre and per well. We probably won't increase our type curves until we have sufficient production history from a number of wells to confirm the results. And we just started that in a broader way 2 or 3 months ago. So it'll take quite a few more months before we have wells online with production history. So if it plays out the way we expect, I -- we would expect an increase in the type curve, but I don't think that's going to happen in the next couple quarters."

Our current thinking as we're starting to put together a business plan for '17 is that we should expect to see a further reduction in that cost or further improvement in efficiencies. A lot of that will be driven by longer laterals that we expect to be able to drill in 2017. And oh, on the number of wells per rig top set, I actually don't have that number. I would guess it's probably 20. If we top set them, we could drill 20 wells with a big rig per year."

One little exception potentially is once you get north of Pittsburgh we have -- you'll see the rectangle goes up there into Southern Butler County and Armstrong County.
