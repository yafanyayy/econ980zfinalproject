274561,322057732,921561,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we",2332,"Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late new year.
Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate.
Similarly, earnings and diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%. By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was and remains the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last 4 years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison, and that will be true in the business segments as well.
Sequentially, the quarters are very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on [ph] a 40 basis point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about a little bit more detail.
So for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9%, helped by a 200 basis point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity, led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year.
Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for 3 reasons: First, we are working of a very large advance payment received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous aircraft for task and fleet reduction parts in connection with the G500 and 600 program. And third, we were also working off large advance payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow.
Let me give you some color on the quarter and year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70 basis point improvement in margin, very nice operating performance.
For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion, and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sale, 5.9% on earnings and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and good order intake.
During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what would be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and 650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and 650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next.
So contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least 1:1; both dollar base, 1:1; and in unit of green delivery, 1.1:1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and 650ER. By the way, an interesting data point. As if there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good.
Let me say a few words about the large cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good. More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I shall also point out that despite the handling by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not a bullion, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEM.
Combat Systems. At combat, revenue was down $90 million or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million or 13.7% on a 140 basis point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15 4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group.
Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million or 2.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and accordance and tactical systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings. Overall, Combat Systems was a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding costs and margin performance.
By the way, in just a moment Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance.
This is a business poised for a modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through '19 timeframe, as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog.
Now Marine systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million or 2.8% compared to the year-ago quarter and down $105 million or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows the $600 million increase in 2014.
Operating earnings were down $21 million or 10.9% against the year-ago quarter and down $9 million or 5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million or 3.6%, in spite of 50 basis point decline in operating margin.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceeded by a fair measure. We forecast margins at 9.5% and round [ph] up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings.
The growth in revenue in the year was driven by electric growth [ph] on 2 Virginia class construction -- 2 Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio replacement program. This group's margin's at a result of a mixed shift. Ohio engineering work, transitioning to Block IV from Block III and increased work on commercial jobs at ships at NASSCO.
IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline, coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground in maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was a result of greater efficiencies and plans and business unit consolidation and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio.
Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 billion or 12.4% against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult compared or as I have mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter or 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million or 5% on a strength of 10.6% margin, 70 basis points better than last quarter.
For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%, very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this -- in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margins. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast.
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5% and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion and operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7% and a return on sales of 9.4%.
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We round up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance: $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a great year by any measure.
So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly; margin rate should be down 10 to 20 basis points; and operating earnings flat to last year; 2017 should look a lot like 2016, with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver G500 in the fourth quarter; revenue and earnings growth will resume with full scale production and delivery of the G500 and 218 and the G600 the following year. In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rates similar to 2015, with more rigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018 and '19. The Marine group is expected to have revenues similar to 2015, but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range.
Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year and additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 to 30 basis point decline in operating margin. Let me remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015 operating earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and '18.
All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue, operating margin around 13.3% and return on sales of roughly 9.1%.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operation. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, assumed -- and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from auction exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time on the same basis.
Let me also reconcile this forecast in 9 22, our 2015 year-end resulted 9 08. In 2016, we will not have the operating gain from the sale of the business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share.
Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this adjusts 2015 to 8 74, and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by 4 and take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, a Q3 even and about 40 -- $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I have more to say on the subject at the end of the first quarter, as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,322057732,921561,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact in our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past.

As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact in our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on our growth experience in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity.
As Phebe pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But in foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015.
For the company as a whole, this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%. As a reminder, this had nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar.
Given what we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuation to be an ongoing part of the group's story.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than a year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015. For 2016, we expect net interest expense of around $95 million, and the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we deployed cash off the balance sheet.
As we deploy that cash over the year, we'd moved from a net cash position of cash in excess of debt of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million, and I'll walk through those capital deployment activity in just a moment.
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark and slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress' enactment of tax extender [indiscernible] late December. In particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some onetime unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extended law. The combined effect was a 20 basis point reduction in the 2015 effective rate or about $0.02 per share.
You may recall at this time last year that given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range.
For 2016, with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range.
Moving on to our pension plans. We contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015 as forecasts. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
And finally, on the capital deployment front. To summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases. And when you combine the share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A"

With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase, and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increased our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid East. As we talked a lot in the past from our perspective, that spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worst.  So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements and we work carefully with them pressure that we can provide them what they need when they wanted it in terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate.

We had less preowned revenues than anticipated and somewhat less-than-anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue, and that was mixed-driven as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FPO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right? We had some of the usual suspects. So we had mixed shift. We had liquidated damages, launched systems. And by the way, you' quite rightly pointed out. We had improved margins in the 650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those are what we -- we'll get leading you to, guiding you to is -- are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate.

And again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship I think is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we internally designed and built. So that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for that very nice. At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of act ship isn't quite ready to point out. There is we believe significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy. And -- but there is demand out there because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure. They have been very competitive in there and Jones Act competitions and won a nice backlog. And we continue that -- we continue to believe we'll add to that backlog. Their service businesses been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is what we believe quite rightly moving to fixed price service contracts, and we know how to work less and we've been very closely with the Navy customers.

With all things at defense, some of that business need to go back to our customer quite appropriately so. So that will cause some margin compression for them.

274561,322057732,921652,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we",2327,"Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year.
Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate.
Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%. By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was, and remains, the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last 4 years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison, and that will be true in the business segments as well.
Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail.
So for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9%, helped by a 200 basis point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity, led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year.
Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for 3 reasons. First, we are working off a very large advance payment received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. And third, we are also working off large advance payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow.
Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70 basis point improvement in margin, very nice operating performance.
For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion, and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sale, 5.9% on earnings and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace, with strong operating leverage and good order intake.
During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what would be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next.
So contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least 1:1, both dollar based, 1:1; and in units of green delivery, 1.1:1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good.
Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good. More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I shall also point out that despite the handling by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not a bull yet, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs.
Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was down $90 million or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million or 13.7% on a 140 basis point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group.
Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million or 2.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings. Overall, Combat Systems was a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations, an outstanding cost and margin performance.
By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance.
This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through '19 time frame, as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog.
Now Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million or 2.8% compared to the year-ago quarter and down $105 million or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows the $600 million increase in 2014.
Operating earnings were down $21 million or 10.9% against the year-ago quarter and down $9 million or 5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million or 3.6%, in spite of 50 basis point decline in operating margin.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceeded by a fair measure. We forecast margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings.
The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on 2 Virginia-class construction -- 2 Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio replacement program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift. Higher engineering work, transitioning to Block IV from Block III, and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO.
IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline, coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was a result of greater efficiencies than planned and business unit consolidation, and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio.
Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million or 12.4% against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator, as I have mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million or 5% on the strength of 10.6% margin, 70 basis points better than last quarter.
For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%, very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this -- in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margins. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast.
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5% and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7% and a return on sales of 9.4%.
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a great year by any measure.
So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly; margin rate should be down 10 to 20 basis points; and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016, with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full-scale production and delivery of the G500 and 2018 and the G600 the following year. In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rates similar to 2015, with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018 and '19. The Marine group is expected to have revenues similar to 2015, but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range.
Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 to 30 basis point decline in operating margin. Let me remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operating earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and '18.
All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue; operating margin around 13.3%; and return on sales of roughly 9.1%.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, assumes -- and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time, on the same basis.
Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result of $9.08. In 2016, we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share.
Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this adjusts 2015 to $8.74, and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by 4 and take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even and about 40 -- $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter, as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,322057732,921652,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past.

As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on our growth experience in our Combat Systems group, given their increasing international activity.
As Phebe pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But as foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015.
For the company as a whole, this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%. As a reminder, this had nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar.
Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015. For 2016, we expect net interest expense of around $95 million, and the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet.
As we deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position of cash in excess of debt of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark and slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress's enactment of tax extenders in late December, in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some onetime unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20 basis point reduction in the 2015 effective rate or about $0.02 per share.
You may recall at this time last year that given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range.
For 2016, with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range.
Moving on to our pension plans. We contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
And finally, on the capital deployment front. To summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases. And when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A"

So no surprises there, and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical and I think very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio for the next year or 2. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase, and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increased our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid East. As we talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worst. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements and we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it, in terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government-to-government, which provides some stability. So that is a benefit to us as well, as we look forward."

We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less-than-anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue, and that was mix-driven, as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right? We had -- from the usual suspects: we had mix shift; we had liquidated damages; launch assistant -- and by the way, you quite rightly pointed out, we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we -- [indiscernible] leading you to, guiding you to is -- are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate.

We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath. And by the way, it announced that on the DDG 1000, the first one is 98% done, so it moves out the door. The second one is 84% done. And again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built. So that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice. At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you've quite rightly pointed out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy. And -- but there is demand out there, and because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and won a nice backlog. And we continue to -- we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog. Their service businesses have been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe quite rightly, moving to fixed price service contracts. And we know how to work those, and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out West in San Diego. But a little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area, as the Navy rejiggers some of its comporting of a major ship. But we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side. Single digit, low single digits with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional -- some Marine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but again right in our sweet spot. And again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio, right? So I did take one clover of that entire portfolio."

That may vary from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year, depending on how much revenue the service business brings in. But for our foreseeable future, that's about a 10% business. Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5%, pretty Steady Eddie. We may have -- and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short-cycle business of OTS, which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated 2 units in 2014. With all things at defense, some of that business need to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so, so that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from -- right now, what we're planning for, for our Combat, steady-state of 15%, 15.5% margin. We will of course strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix, as we've talked about before. Performance at shipyard is all -- our well-performing shipyard is all about the mix.

274561,322057732,921701,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we",2327,"Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year.
Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate.
Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%. By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was, and remains, the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last 4 years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison, and that will be true in the business segments as well.
Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail.
So for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9%, helped by a 200 basis point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity, led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year.
Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for 3 reasons. First, we are working off a very large advance payment received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. And third, we are also working off large advance payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow.
Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70 basis point improvement in margin, very nice operating performance.
For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion, and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sales, 5.9% on earnings and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace, with strong operating leverage and good order intake.
During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what would be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next.
So contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least 1:1, both dollar based, 1:1; and in units of green delivery, 1.1:1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good.
Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good. More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I shall also point out that despite the handling by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not ebullient, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs.
Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was down $90 million or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million or 13.7% on a 140 basis point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group.
Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million or 2.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings. Overall, Combat Systems was a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance.
By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance.
This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through '19 time frame, as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog.
Now Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million or 2.8% compared to the year-ago quarter and down $105 million or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows the $600 million increase in 2014.
Operating earnings were down $21 million or 10.9% against the year-ago quarter and down $9 million or 5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million or 3.6%, in spite of 50 basis point decline in operating margin.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceeded by a fair measure. We forecast margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings.
The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on 2 Virginia-class construction -- sub [ph] 2 Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio replacement program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift. Higher engineering work, transitioning to Block IV from Block III, and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO.
IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline, coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was a result of greater efficiencies than planned and business unit consolidation, and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio.
Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million or 12.4% against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator, as I have mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million or 5% on the strength of 10.6% margin, 70 basis points better than last quarter.
For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%, very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this -- in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margins. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast.
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5% and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7% and a return on sales of 9.4%.
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a great year by any measure.
So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly; margin rate should be down 10 to 20 basis points; and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016, with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full-scale production and delivery of the G500 in 2018 and the G600 the following year. In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rates similar to 2015, with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018 and '19. The Marine group is expected to have revenues similar to 2015, but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range.
Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 to 30 basis point decline in operating margin. Let me remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operating earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and '18.
All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue; operating margin around 13.3%; and return on sales of roughly 9.1%.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, assumes -- and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time, on the same basis.
Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result of $9.08. In 2016, we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share.
Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this adjusts 2015 to $8.74, and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by 4 and take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even and about 40 -- $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter, as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,322057732,921701,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past.

As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on our growth experience in our Combat Systems group, given their increasing international activity.
As Phebe pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015.
For the company as a whole, this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%. As a reminder, this had nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar.
Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015. For 2016, we expect net interest expense of around $95 million, and the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet.
As we deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position of cash in excess of debt of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark and slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress's enactment of tax extenders in late December, in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some onetime unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20 basis point reduction in the 2015 effective rate or about $0.02 per share.
You may recall at this time last year that given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range.
For 2016, with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range.
Moving on to our pension plans. We contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
And finally, on the capital deployment front. To summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases. And when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A"

So no surprises there, and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical, and I think very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio, for the next year or 2. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase, and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increased our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid East. As we talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worst. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements and we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it, in terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government-to-government, which provides some stability.

We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less-than-anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue, and that was mix-driven, as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right? We had -- from the usual suspects: we had mix shift; we had liquidated damages; launch assistant -- and by the way, you quite rightly pointed out, we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we -- [indiscernible] leading you to, guiding you to is -- are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate. But what we are focused on, and have been laser-focused on and have been telling our investors for some time, we are going to keep earnings flat.

We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath. And by the way, it announced that on the DDG 1000, the first one is 98% done, so almost out the door. The second one is 84% done. And again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built. So that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice. At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you've quite rightly pointed out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced, for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy. And -- but there is demand out there, and because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and want a nice backlog. And we continue to -- we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog. Their service businesses have been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe quite rightly, moving to fixed price service contracts. And we know how to work those, and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out West in San Diego. But a little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area, as the Navy rejiggers some of its comporting of some major ships. But we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side. Single digit, low single digits with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional -- submarine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but again right in our sweet spot. And again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio, right? So I encourage you to think [ph] one silver of that entire portfolio."

That may vary from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year, depending on how much revenue the service business brings in. But for our foreseeable future, that's about a 10% business. Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5%, pretty Steady Eddie. We may have -- and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short-cycle business of OTS, which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated 2 units in 2014. With all things at defense, some of that business need to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so, so that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from -- right now, what we're planning for, for our Combat, steady-state of 15%, 15.5% margin. We will of course strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix, as we've talked about before. Performance at shipyard is all -- our well-performing shipyard is all about the mix.

274561,322057732,921866,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we",2327,"Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7 -- $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year.
Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate.
Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%. By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was, and remains, the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last 4 years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison, and that will be true in the business segments as well.
Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail.
So for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9%, helped by a 200 basis point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity, led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year.
Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for 3 reasons. First, we are working off a very large advance payment received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. And third, we are also working off large advance payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow.
Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70 basis point improvement in margin, very nice operating performance.
For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion, and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sales, 5.9% on earnings and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace, with strong operating leverage and good order intake.
During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what would be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next.
So contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least 1:1, both dollar based, 1:1; and in units of green delivery, 1.1:1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good.
Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good. More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I shall also point out that despite the handling by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not ebullient, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs.
Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was down $90 million or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million or 13.7% on a 140 basis point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group.
Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million or 2.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings. Overall, Combat Systems was a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance.
By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance.
This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through '19 time frame, as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog.
Now Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million or 2.8% compared to the year-ago quarter and down $105 million or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows the $600 million increase in 2014.
Operating earnings were down $21 million or 10.9% against the year-ago quarter and down $9 million or 5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million or 3.6%, in spite of 50 basis point decline in operating margin.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceeded by a fair measure. We forecast margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings.
The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on 2 Virginia-class construction -- sub [ph] 2 Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio replacement program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift. Higher engineering work, transitioning to Block IV from Block III, and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO.
IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline, coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was a result of greater efficiencies than planned and business unit consolidation, and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio.
Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million or 12.4% against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator, as I have mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million or 5% on the strength of 10.6% margin, 70 basis points better than last quarter.
For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%, very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this -- in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margins. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast.
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5% and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7% and a return on sales of 9.4%.
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a great year by any measure.
So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly; margin rate should be down 10 to 20 basis points; and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016, with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full-scale production and delivery of the G500 in 2018 and the G600 the following year. In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rates similar to 2015, with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018 and '19. The Marine group is expected to have revenues similar to 2015, but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range.
Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 to 30 basis point decline in operating margin. Let me remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operating earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and '18.
All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue; operating margin around 13.3%; and return on sales of roughly 9.1%.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, assumes -- and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time, on the same basis.
Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result of $9.08. In 2016, we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share.
Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this adjusts 2015 to $8.74, and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by 4 and take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even and about 40 -- $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter, as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,322057732,921866,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past.

As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on our growth experience in our Combat Systems group, given their increasing international activity.
As Phebe pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015.
For the company as a whole, this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%. As a reminder, this had nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar.
Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015. For 2016, we expect net interest expense of around $95 million, and the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet.
As we deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position of cash in excess of debt of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark and slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress's enactment of tax extenders in late December, in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some onetime unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20 basis point reduction in the 2015 effective rate or about $0.02 per share.
You may recall at this time last year that given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range.
For 2016, with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range.
Moving on to our pension plans. We contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
And finally, on the capital deployment front. To summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases. And when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A"

So no surprises there, and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical, and I think very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio, for the next year or 2. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase, and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increased our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid East. As we talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worst. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements and we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it, in terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government-to-government, which provides some stability.

We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less-than-anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue, and that was mix-driven, as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right? We had -- from the usual suspects: we had mix shift; we had liquidated damages; launch assistant -- and by the way, you quite rightly pointed out, we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we -- [indiscernible] leading you to, guiding you to is -- are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate.

We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath. And by the way, it announced that on the DDG 1000, the first one is 98% done, so almost out the door. The second one is 84% done. And again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built. So that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice. At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you've quite rightly pointed out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced, for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy. And -- but there is demand out there, and because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and want a nice backlog. And we continue to -- we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog. Their service businesses have been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe quite rightly, moving to fixed price service contracts. And we know how to work those, and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out West in San Diego. But a little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area, as the Navy rejiggers some of its comporting of some major ships. But we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side. Single digit, low single digits with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional -- submarine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but again right in our sweet spot. And again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio, right? So I encourage you to think [ph] one silver of that entire portfolio."

Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5%, pretty Steady Eddie. We may have -- and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short-cycle business of OTS, which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated 2 units in 2014. With all things at defense, some of that business need to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so, so that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from -- right now, what we're planning for, for our Combat, steady-state of 15%, 15.5% margin. We will of course strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix, as we've talked about before. Performance at shipyard is all -- our well-performing shipyard is all about the mix.

I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. So first quarter",1148,"Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. 
So first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenue somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you. The diluted weighted average share count was 312.3 million for the quarter compared to consensus of about 315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the outperformance. 
I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the outperformance came from strong operating results as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. 
With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures, the $65 million, we have $374 million of free cash flow from operations. The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter '15, revenue was down $16 million, less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 40 basis point improvement in margin. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%, but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30 basis point improvement margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of a positive operating leverage. Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. 
So let me provide some commentary and little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million compared to Q1 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million sequentially against the strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6% on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. 
Operating earnings were up $1 million sequentially on 160 basis points improvement operating margin. Orders to the group were typical of the first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were $1.3 billion, worth $1.3 billion in the dollar book base book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015. The aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last 5 years including '16 is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5. 
So it was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthen, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins and slot operating earnings for the year. 
We still believe we will be a flat operating earnings for the year but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher-margin. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries into next year and still come out in the same place. 
Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $149 million or 27.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion of Ohio replacement program, which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for that 80% of the construction of new subs. The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe and we find that very wholesome. 
Some of the more interesting comparisons are combat systems. Compared to the first quarter and 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing, but earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013 in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down only $17 million on a 160 basis points improvement in margin. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite awesome. 
Also in the fourth quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low rate production on 2 large international orders for Canada, the Middle East and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow for the next several years. Even given combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance at combat systems. 
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against the year-ago quarter and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter was $31 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margin. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million or 7.8% and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction. 
I think it's important to note that IS&T backlog grew by $851 million in the quarter and the book to-bill-was 1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last 3 years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast cycle businesses. 
So we're off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for many years to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

About a year ago, we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact of foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within combat systems. Remember, we're referring to the translation of our international results in the U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm our contract. 
This continues to be a factor in 2016 and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year-ago period, our revenues in the combat segment with that declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year. 
Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over $1 billion on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than 3x our free cash flow from operations. And we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so. 
At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains a strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full-year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll turn back to you for the Q&A."

We take revenue directly from the operating plan and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed delivery, service volume and mix, which by the way, can and do move across reporting periods. Free owned jet aviation services and completion. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, I think it's a pretty good one. Our plan has a selling between 10 to 14 preowned airplanes with revenue of $250 million at breakeven margin. It's very difficult to forecast this. This quarter had 1 sale for $4 million, a good thing about the lower revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane green and completion delivery because of the backlog of the 650s. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4, but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year and that's what we think. It's feasible."

Just think about it as firsthand intelligence, not second and third hand conjecture. So we let me parse this in some specificity. For sales activity, as I noted in the quarter, is similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter and orders this quarter were as anticipated seasonally late. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarters seem to slow down some purchasing decision, but our pipeline remains active. Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large cabin planes by others. So think about it this way, no change on that front. Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year and the first available EIS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall that the 650 has 100% market share for market it created and from my perspective, it would appear, I think, it's safe to assume or what I see is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plate and our demand is solid. The number of preowned 650s apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale of the preowned aircraft. So I tried to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield and give you the fact by the large cabin airplanes that we sell."

And that, along with 2 per year, Virginia has driven some of the growth. From my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. While we don't have specific timelines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early -- likely to see past is prologue, some early material purchases so that we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will really begin to ramp up really in the '20 and go on for some time. The margin profile way up is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured. And I don't know. We don't know yet and I think the Navy, we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex label shipbuilding programs, the first ship is cost-plus, but that's the Navy's decision and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But again, as past is prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their cost and improving their manufacturing efficiency haul over haul. So I think this is a very important program for General Dynamics, increasingly now but very much in the future."

With these IDIQ programs, you've got to sort of handicap what you see as your win rate. We typically have been very successful in our win rates, but again, it will be a highly competitive and we're just going to have to work our way through it.

We've got additional opportunities from margin improvement inefficiencies in performance and margin performance in this group on the Mission Systems side is heavily driven by the product mix.

The Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into that program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider. The second thing is our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about a quarter. So again, that's gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know is that, that has experienced him cost growth, primarily on the first class ship, which is the cost plus boat, but that's not a surprise, given the complexity of the ship. And we continue to work closely with the Navy to ensure that we're delivering the ship that they want and they need operationally. And we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk on the second 2 ships. The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000 and we see some impact as we started the line, the 50 ones -- and by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different, upgraded than the former flight.

A very active market. And so it has pretty good throughput. So I think in the last 12 months that we sold 20 -- the market so 29 used G550. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates and conversion. I hear less about the 450 used market, but I think the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane order to a used airplane. I would also comment that, as I noted before, this preowned market is developing market. For example, how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been in there for 3 years and not lowered the price. And there's not been a transaction there for some time. The early 650s, yearly model and numbers that we are available to sellers or are available are attractive at favorable prices, above the original fare prices earlier on. But we've got to see how the market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used market get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative to a third outcome."

I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. So first",1150,"Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. 
So first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you. The diluted weighted average share count was 312.3 million for the quarter compared to consensus of about 315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the outperformance.  I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the outperformance came from strong operating results is evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. 
With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of $65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter '15, revenue was down $16 million [ph], less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 40 basis point improvement in margin. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%, but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30 basis point improvement margin. All of the foregoing is reflection of positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. 
So let me provide some commentary and little perspective around the results of our operating segments. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million compared to Q1 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million, sequentially, against the strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6%, on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin.  Operating earnings were up $1 million, sequentially, on 160 basis points improvement operating margin. 
Orders to the group were typical over the first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of $1.3 billion -- were $1.3 billion, and the dollar book base -- book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015.  The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last 5 years, including '16, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5. 
So it was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We have previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins and flat operating earnings for the year.  We still believe we will be a flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margin. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries into next year and still come out in the same place. 
Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. 
We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program, which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for that 80% of the construction of new subs. The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome. 
Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at combat systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing. But earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013 in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down only $17 million on a 160 basis point improvement in margin. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome. 
Also in the fourth quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low-rate production on 2 large international orders for Canada, the Mid-East and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow for the next several years. Even given combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at combat systems. 
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against the year-ago quarter and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter was $31 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margin. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction. 
I think it's important to note that IS&T backlog grew by $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was 1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last 3 years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast-cycle businesses. 
So we were off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

About a year ago, we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within combat systems. Remember, we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm our contracts. 
This continues to be a factor in 2016 and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year-ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year. 
Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over $1 billion on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than 3x our free cash flow from operations. And we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so. 
At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remained strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. 
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full-year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year. 
Erin, That concludes my remarks. I'll turn back over to you for the Q&A."

We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed delivery, service volume and mix, which by the way, can and do move across reporting periods preowned jet aviation services and completions. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, I think it's a pretty good one, our plan has a selling between 10 to 14 preowned airplanes, with revenue of $250 million at breakeven margins. It's very difficult to forecast this. This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing but the lower revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane green and completion delivery because of the backlog of the 650s. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible."

So what I want to do is give you some facts and set of speculations and think about it as first-hand intelligence, not second and third-hand conjecture. So let me parse this in some specificity. For sales activity, as I noted in the quarter, is similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were, as anticipated, seasonally late. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarters seem to slow down some purchasing decision, but our pipeline remains active. Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large-cabin planes by others. So think about it this way, no change on that front. Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available EIS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall that the 650 has a 100% market share for market it created, and from my perspective, it would appear -- I think it's safe to assume or what I see is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of preowned 650s apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to preowned aircraft. So I try to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield and give you the facts by the large-cabin airplanes that we sell."

We have, over the last 3 years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins are on the cost-plus-work tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that along with 2 per year, Virginia has driven some of the growth. From my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward until that begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. While we don't have specific timelines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early -- likely to see past is prologue, some early material purchases so that we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will really begin to ramp up really in the '20s and go on for some time. The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy is -- we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval shipbuilding programs, the first ship is cost-plus, but that's the Navy's decision, and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But again, as past as prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their costs and improving their manufacturing efficiency haul-over-haul. So I think this is a very important program for General Dynamics increasingly now but very much in the future."

First, we are not the integrator of prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into that program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider. The second thing is, our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about 1/4. So again, that's gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months, and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know is that, that has experienced him cost growth primarily on the first class ship, which is the cost-plus boat. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work closely with the Navy to ensure that we're delivering the ship that they want and that they need operationally and we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk on the second 2 ships. The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000, and we've seen some impacts as we started up cold line, the 51s -- and by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different, upgraded than the former flight, but we're confident that we can work through these.

But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model type. So let's think about it in 2 respects. You got the 450/550 used market that is mature. It's established. It has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior, and we watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is in an immature developing market. So let me parse. If it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. 
So with respect to the 450/550, we did lose some G550s to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models that were available and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, a very active market. And so it has pretty good throughput. So I think, in the last 12 months we sold -- the market so 29 used G550. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates and conversions. I hear less about the 450 used market, because, I think, the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane order to a used airplane. I would also comment that, as I noted before, this preowned market is developing market. For example, it's nor clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been in there for 3 years and not lowered the price. And there has not been a transaction there for some time. The early 650s, the early models, N numbers that available to sellers or are available are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sales prices with earlier-on, but we've got to see how the market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used market get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative third outcomes."

I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. So first",1150,"Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. 
So first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you. The diluted weighted average share count was 312.3 million for the quarter compared to consensus of about 315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the outperformance.  I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the outperformance came from strong operating results, as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. 
With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of $65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter '15, revenue was down $60 million [ph], less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 40 basis point improvement in margin. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%, but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30 basis point improvement margin. All of the foregoing is reflection of positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. 
So let me provide some commentary and little perspective around the results of our operating segments. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million compared to Q1 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million, sequentially, against a strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6%, on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin.  Operating earnings were up $1 million, sequentially, on 160 basis point improvement operating margin. 
Orders to the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of $1.3 billion -- were $1.3 billion, and the dollar book base -- book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015.  The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last 5 years, including '16, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5. 
So it was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins and flat operating earnings for the year.  We still believe we will be at flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margins. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries into next year and still come out in the same place. 
Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. 
We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program, which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for that 80% of the construction of new subs. The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome. 
Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing. But earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margins. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013 in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down only $17 million on a 160 basis point improvement in margin. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome. 
Also in the fourth quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low-rate production on 2 large international orders for Canada, the Mid-East and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow for the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at Combat Systems. 
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against the year-ago quarter and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter was $31 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction. 
I think it's important to note that IS&T backlog grew by $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was 1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last 3 years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast-cycle businesses. 
So we were off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

About a year ago, we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within Combat Systems. Remember, we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm to our contracts. 
This continues to be a factor in 2016, and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year-ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year. 
Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over $1 billion on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than 3x our free cash flow from operations. And we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so. 
At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remained strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. 
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full-year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year. 
Erin, That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed deliveries, service volume and mix -- which by the way, can and do move across reporting periods -- preowned jet aviation services and completions. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, and I think it's a pretty good one, our plan has a selling between 10 to 14 preowned airplanes, with revenue of $250 million at breakeven margins. It's very difficult to forecast this. This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing but below our revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane green and completion deliveries because of the backlog of the 650s. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible."

First sales activity, as I noted in the quarter, is similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were, as anticipated, seasonally late. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarter seemed to slow down some purchasing decisions, but our pipeline remains active. Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large-cabin planes by others. So think about it this way, no change on that front. Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available EIS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall that the 650 has a 100% market share for a market it created, and from my perspective, it would appear -- I think it's safe to assume or what I see is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of preowned 650s apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to preowned aircraft. So I've try to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield and give you the facts by the large-cabin airplanes that we sell."

We have, over the last 3 years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins that are on the cost-plus work [ph] tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that a round of 2 per year for Virginia has driven some of the growth. From my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. While we don't have specific timelines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early -- likely to see it past as prologue, some early material purchases so that we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will really begin to ramp up really in the '20s and go on for some time. The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy is -- we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval shipbuilding programs, the first ship is cost-plus, but that's the Navy's decision, and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But again, as past as prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their costs and improving their manufacturing efficiency hull-over-hull. So I think this is a very important program for General Dynamics increasingly now but very much in the future."

So we've got considerable interest in places that you might think. Just to give you a little bit of color on some of the contracts that we just put into backlog, the Swiss Army is purchasing 4x4 combat vehicles, and that went in, I think, this quarter, for about $400 million, U.S. dollars. So that was good. The Czech Republic is on the map as is the Spanish 8x8 technology programs. And our Land Systems is in good position on that program. And then we continue to see the demand signals coming out of the Mid-East, Iraqi tanks, Kuwait and in other parts of the Mid-East, where there are some really hot wars going on. So the pipeline looks good internationally. And if you look at that Army budget, they're beginning to recapitalize. So that's pretty wholesome in and of itself.

It's been out on 2 sea trials, and we like what we see, and more importantly, our customer seems too. But let me remind everybody of a couple of things. First, we are not the integrator or prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into the program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider. The second thing is, our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about 1/4. So again, that's gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months, and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know is that, that [indiscernible] has experienced some cost growth, primarily on the first class ship, which is the cost-plus boat. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work closely with the Navy to ensure that we're delivering the ship that they want and that they need operationally and that we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk on the second 2 ships. The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000, and we've seen some impacts as we started up a cold line, the 51s -- and by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different, upgraded than the former flight, but we're confident that we can work through these. I mean, we know these ships. So again, we're working with the Navy on schedule and cost so that we can ensure we get them what they need with the profitability that we require."

But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model type. So let's think about it in 2 respects. You got the 450/550 used market that is mature. It's established. It has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior. I mean, we watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is in an immature developing market. So let me parse. If it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. 
So with respect to the 450/550, we did lose some G550s to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models that were available and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, a very active market. And so it has pretty good throughput. So I think, in the last 12 months we sold -- the market so 29 used G550. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates and conversions. I hear less about the 450 used market, because, I think, the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane order to a used airplane. I would also comment that, as I noted before, this preowned market is a developing market. For example, it's nor clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been in there for 3 years and not lowered the price. And there has not been a transaction there for some time. The early 650s, the early model, N numbers that available to sellers or are available are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sales prices or the earlier-on, but we've got to see how the market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used market get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative for [ph] outcomes."

I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward.

I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data upfront and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. 
So first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you. The diluted weighted average share count was 312.3 million for the quarter compared to consensus of about 315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the outperformance.  I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the outperformance came from strong operating results, as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. 
With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of $65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter '15, revenue was down $60 million [ph], less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 40 basis point improvement in margin. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%, but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30 basis point improvement margin. All of the foregoing is reflection of positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. 
So let me provide some commentary and little perspective around the results of our operating segments. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million compared to Q1 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million, sequentially, against a strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6%, on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin.  Operating earnings were up $1 million, sequentially, on 160 basis point improvement operating margin. 
Orders to the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of $1.3 billion -- were $1.3 billion, and the dollar book base -- book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015.  The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last 5 years, including '16, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5. 
So it was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins and flat operating earnings for the year.  We still believe we will be at flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margins. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries into next year and still come out in the same place. 
Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. 
We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program, which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for that 80% of the construction of new subs. The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome. 
Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing. But earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margins. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013 in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down only $17 million on a 160 basis point improvement in margin. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome. 
Also in the fourth quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low-rate production on 2 large international orders for Canada, the Mid-East and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow for the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at Combat Systems. 
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against the year-ago quarter and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter was $31 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction. 
I think it's important to note that IS&T backlog grew by $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was 1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last 3 years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast-cycle businesses. 
So we were off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

About a year ago, we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within Combat Systems. Remember, we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm to our contracts. 
This continues to be a factor in 2016, and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year-ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year. 
Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year. 
Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over $1 billion on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than 3x our free cash flow from operations. And we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so. 
At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remained strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. 
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full-year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year. 
Erin, That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed deliveries, service volume and mix -- which by the way, can and do move across reporting periods -- preowned jet aviation services and completions. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, and I think it's a pretty good one, our plan has a selling between 10 to 14 preowned airplanes, with revenue of $250 million at breakeven margins. It's very difficult to forecast this. This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing but below our revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane green and completion deliveries because of the backlog of the 650s. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible."

So what I want to do is give you some facts instead of speculations and think about it as first-hand intelligence, not second and third-hand conjecture. So let me parse this in some specificity. First sales activity, as I noted in the quarter, is similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were, as anticipated, seasonally late. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarter seemed to slow down some purchasing decisions, but our pipeline remains active. Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large-cabin planes by others. So think about it this way, no change on that front. Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available EIS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall that the 650 has a 100% market share for a market it created, and from my perspective, it would appear -- I think it's safe to assume or what I see is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of preowned 650s apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to preowned aircraft. So I've try to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield and give you the facts by the large-cabin airplanes that we sell."

We have, over the last 3 years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins that are on the cost-plus work [ph] tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that a round of 2 per year for Virginia has driven some of the growth. From my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. While we don't have specific timelines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early -- likely to see it past as prologue, some early material purchases so that we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will really begin to ramp up really in the '20s and go on for some time. The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy is -- we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval shipbuilding programs, the first ship is cost-plus, but that's the Navy's decision, and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But again, as past as prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their costs and improving their manufacturing efficiency hull-over-hull.

But the business unit guys were saying, ""And oh, by the way, in addition to cost savings, we're going to see some marketing synergies,"" and I said, ""Yes, good, great."" Well, it turns out they were right. So they have won more than their fair share and that's reflected in no small measure in that 1.3 book-to-bill. And their performance, operating performance, is really terrific. Now this margin rate in the moment is a bit high going forward. And while I'm not ready to update guidance, this group should be a double-digit earner in the near future. We've got additional opportunities from margin improvement in efficiencies and performance, and margin performance in this group on the Mission Systems side is heavily driven by the product mix. On the IT side, again, this is a very competitive business with terrific cash flow and, as I always like to tell everybody, great return on invested capital. They are very disciplined. And -- when they go into the market and they win their fair share. And when I say disciplined, we're careful that we don't pursue contracts down the rat holes, where we don't think we can get a decent return."

First, we are not the integrator or prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into the program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider. The second thing is, our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about 1/4. So again, that's gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months, and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know is that, that [indiscernible] has experienced some cost growth, primarily on the first class ship, which is the cost-plus boat. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work closely with the Navy to ensure that we're delivering the ship that they want and that they need operationally and that we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk on the second 2 ships. The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000, and we've seen some impacts as we started up a cold line, the 51s -- and by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different, upgraded than the former flight, but we're confident that we can work through these. I mean, we know these ships. So again, we're working with the Navy on schedule and cost so that we can ensure we get them what they need with the profitability that we require."

But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model type. So let's think about it in 2 respects. You got the 450/550 used market that is mature. It's established. It has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior. I mean, we watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is in an immature developing market. So let me parse. If it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. 
So with respect to the 450/550, we did lose some G550s to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models that were available and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, a very active market. And so it has pretty good throughput. So I think, in the last 12 months we sold -- the market so 29 used G550. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates and conversions. I hear less about the 450 used market, because, I think, the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane order to a used airplane. I would also comment that, as I noted before, this preowned market is a developing market. For example, it's not clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been in there for 3 years and not lowered the price. And there has not been a transaction there for some time. The early 650s, the early model, N numbers that available to sellers or are available are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sales prices or the earlier-on, but we've got to see how the market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used market get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative for [ph] outcomes."

As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion and net earnings of $758 million. We've reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than th",1711,"Thank you, Erin, and good morning. As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion and net earnings of $758 million. We've reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. 
With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margin and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher-margin, $10 million less in taxes resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30-basis-point improvement in operating margin and 140-basis-point lower effective tax rate. 
I should note that our earnings in the year-ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our commercial cyber business, excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis-point improvement in operating legend. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million or less than 1% and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in operating margin and a lower effective tax rate. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 as compared to the first half of '15. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million, EPS was $0.36 better. 
In short, we're off to a good start ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million or only $5 million less on a 90-basis-point improvement in operating margin. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4% and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the $450 million and the $550 million, offset in part by increased delivery of the $650 million. However, earnings at $845 million are only $25 million -- or off only $25 million on a 60-basis-point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings to the first half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goals for the year. 
By the way, recall that last year, we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supply of settlement. After that contribution, earnings actually would have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about the order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book to bill was not much better, about 1/3 of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin. Activity in interest level were good throughout the quarter, but at the end of the quarter, when many transactions typically closed, activity almost seized as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. 
We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month slightly improved economic stories in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction seem to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. 
You may recall that in the G500 made its flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mack. Flight test is going very well and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year. 
Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, 60-basis-point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All in all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3% and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million or 6.6% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130-basis-point margin expansion. Pretty impressive operating performance. 
Work is progressing quite well in our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our Program and our Canadian Mideast contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast yielding of the Gun Stryker. 
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on summary material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million or 4.4% against the first half of '15. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half. 
Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year-ago quarter, $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the commercial cyber product business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6% on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is a strongest in nearly 5 years. 
The story for the first half as much the same, revenue was down $23 million, 1/2 of a percent, and operating earnings were up $38 million or 8.4% on a 90 basis point improvement of margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. 
This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book to bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book to bill equal to or greater than one-to-one. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half. 
So turning to guidance. Let me provide this some guidance for the year for each segment and then compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace. Our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year, even if slightly better. Despite all the handling by some, these 2 businesses will continue to perform well. 
So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. 
For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between 8.1% and $8.2 billion and margins around 9.2%. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure and that operating margins will be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year. 
So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion. Operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion and the return on sale of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue with higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second, but much like the first, followed by a very strong fourth quarter. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO."

I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems gro",473,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group. And when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million at the exchange rate that prevailed in the first half of 2015, remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher. 
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover it just a minute. 
We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, but more related to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflect the cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature and we're in the process of refinancing that that as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million for general corporate purposes to include share repurchases. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock option and restricted stock. 
In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We have a rate at 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full year rate right around 29%. 
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividend we paid to the first 6 months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder friendly capital deployment, more than 2x our free cash flow for the first half. 
Erin, that concludes was my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this -- our market in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the 650 preowned market. So I've seen some folks saying there's going to be 20 or there are 21 used planes in the market. We simply don't not see that. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with 1 pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5 of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a 650 used market. So in my mind, that should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near term availability rather than wait. So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that, that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So 650, so if you talk about by model, the 650 demand remains quite active. In our submarkets, subsections of the market, the 450 and 550 are, as we anticipated, during this period of transition to the 500 and 600, complicated the touch by competitor's over production. By the way, I might tell you that the 500 and 600 positions are sold to the lot -- a lot of those positions are sold in '16 and '17. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America and I think the rest split between Mid East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order. Okay?"

As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the y",1721,"Thank you, Erin, and good morning. As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. 
With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margin and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin and 140 basis point lower effective tax rate. 
I should note that our earnings in the year-ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our commercial cyber business, excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million or less than 1% and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins and a lower effective tax rate. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 in compared to the first half of '15. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million, EPS was $0.36 better. 
In short, we're off to a good start ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million or only $5 million less on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4% and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the 450  and the 550, offset in part by increased delivery of the 650. However, earnings at $845 million are only $25 million  or off only $25 million on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings to the first half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year. 
By the way, recall that last year, we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supply of settlement. After that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book to bill was not much better, about 1/3 of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin. Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter, but at the end of the quarter, when many transactions typically closed, activity almost seized as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. 
We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month slightly improved economic stories in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction seem to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. 
You may recall that the G500 made its flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mack. Flight test is going very well and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year. 
Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, 60 basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All in all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3% and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million or 6.6% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130 basis point margin expansion, pretty impressive operating performance. 
Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX Program and our Canadian Mideast contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast yielding of the Upgun Stryker. 
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on summary material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million or 4.4% against the first half of '15. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half. 
Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year-ago quarter, $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the commercial cyber product business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6% on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly 5 years. 
The story for the first half is much the same, revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million or 8.4% on a 90 basis point improvement of margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. 
This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1 to 1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half. 
So turning to guidance. Let me provide just some guidance for the year for each segment and then compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace. Our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year, even slightly better. Despite all the [ph] hammering by some, these 2 businesses will continue to perform well. 
So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. 
For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion and margins around 9.2%. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure and that operating margins will be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year. 
So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion and the return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue with higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second, but much like the first, followed by a very strong fourth quarter. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO."

I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation.

I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group. And when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million at the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015, remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher. 
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. 
We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, but more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects the cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million for general corporate purposes to include share repurchases. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. 
In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full year rate right around 29%. 
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividend we paid to the first 6 months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder friendly capital deployment, more than 2x our free cash flow for the first half. 
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So I've seen some folks saying there's going to be 20 or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with 1 pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5 of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a 650 used market. So in my mind, there should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near term availability rather than wait. So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that, that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So 650, so if you talk about by model, the 650 demand remains quite active. In our submarkets, subsections of the markets, the 450 and 550 are, as we anticipated, during this period of transition to the 500 and 600, complicated the touch by competitor's over production. By the way, I might tell you that the 500 and 600 positions are sold to a lot of -- a lot of those positions are sold in '16 and '17. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America and I think the rest split between Mid East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order. Okay?"

So I wouldn't say that, that Democratic some chatter in the system suggest they're walking away from this requirement. So I think in terms of the -- the navy has budgeted here a revenue flow to us that we can easily accommodate the CapEx and the other improvements that we have going forward in terms of the ability to build these. I might also tell you that we've been spending CapEx over the last few years to position ourselves, particularly at the quantum point on the Ohio replacement. So we work very carefully with our navy customer to determine what they need, what we need, the funding allocation, who's responsible for what and we're certainly not going to get caught long."

As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. 
With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margin and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin and 140 basis point lower effective tax rate. 
I should note that our earnings in the year ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our commercial cyber business. Excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million or less than 1% and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins and a lower effective tax rate. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 and compare it to the first half of '15. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million, EPS was $0.36 better. 
In short, we're off to a good start ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million were only $5 million less on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4% and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the 450 and the 550, offset in part by increased delivery of the 650. However, earnings at $845 million are only $25 million or off only $25 million on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year. 
By the way, recall that last year, we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supply of settlement. After that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book-to-bill was not much better, about 1/3 of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin. Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter, but at the end of the quarter, when many transactions typically close, activity almost ceased as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. 
We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month, slightly improved economic stories in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction seem to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. 
You may recall that the G500 made its first flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mach. Flight test is going very well and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year. 
Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter. All in all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3% and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million or 6.6% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130 basis point margin expansion, pretty impressive operating performance. 
Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX Program and our Canadian Mideast contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast yielding[ph] of the Upgun Stryker. 
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on summary material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million or 4.4% against the first half of '15. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half. 
Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year ago quarter, $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the commercial cyber product business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6% on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly 5 years. 
The story for the first half is much the same, revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million or 8.4% on a 90 basis point improvement of margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. 
This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1 to 1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half. 
So turning to guidance. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment and then compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace. Our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year, even slightly better. Despite all the hand wringing by some, these 2 businesses will continue to perform well. 
So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. 
For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion and margins around 9.2%. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure and that operating margins will be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year. 
So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion and the return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue but higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second, but much like the first, followed by a very strong fourth quarter. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO."

I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation.

I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group. And when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million had the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015, remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher. 
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. 
We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, but more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects the cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million for general corporate purposes to include share repurchases. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. 
In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full year rate right around 29%. 
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first 6 months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder friendly capital deployment, more than 2x our free cash flow for the first half. 
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this -- our market in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the 650 preowned market. So I've seen some folks saying there's going to be 20 or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with 1 pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5 of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a 650 used market. So in my mind, there should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near term availability rather than wait. So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that, that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So 650, so if you talk about by model, the 650 demand remains quite active. In our submarkets, subsections of the market, the 450 and 550 are, as we anticipated, during this period of transition to the 500 and 600, complicated the touch by competitor's overproduction. By the way, I might tell you that the 500 and 600 positions are sold to a lot of -- a lot of those positions are sold in '16 and '17. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America and I think the rest split between Mid East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order. Okay?"

So I wouldn't say that, that Democratic some chatter in the system suggests they're walking away from this requirement. So I think in terms of the -- the Navy has budgeted here a revenue flow to us that we can easily accommodate the CapEx and the other improvements that we have going forward in terms of the ability to build these. I might also tell you that we've been spending CapEx over the last few years to position ourselves, particularly at the quantum point on the Ohio replacement. So we work very carefully with our Navy customer to determine what they need, what we need, the funding allocation, who's responsible for what and we're certainly not going to get caught long."

As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. 
With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margin and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin and 140 basis point lower effective tax rate. 
I should note that our earnings in the year ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our commercial cyber business. Excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million or less than 1% and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins and a lower effective tax rate. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 and compare it to the first half of '15. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million, EPS was $0.36 better. 
In short, we're off to a good start ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million were only $5 million less on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4% and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the 450 and the 550, offset in part by increased delivery of the 650. However, earnings at $845 million are only $25 million or off only $25 million on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year. 
By the way, recall that last year, we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supply of settlement. After that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book-to-bill was not much better, about 1/3 of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin. Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter, but at the end of the quarter, when many transactions typically close, activity almost ceased as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. 
We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month, slightly improved economic stories in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction seem to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. 
You may recall that the G500 made its first flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mach. Flight test is going very well and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year. 
Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter. All in all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3% and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million or 6.6% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130 basis point margin expansion, pretty impressive operating performance. 
Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX Program and our Canadian Mideast contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast yielding [ph] of the Upgun Stryker. 
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on summary material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million or 4.4% against the first half of '15. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half. 
Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year ago quarter, $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the commercial cyber product business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6% on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly 5 years. 
The story for the first half is much the same, revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million or 8.4% on a 90 basis point improvement of margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. 
This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1 to 1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half. 
So turning to guidance. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment and then compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. 
For Aerospace. Our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year, even slightly better. Despite all the hand wringing by some, these 2 businesses will continue to perform well. 
So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. 
For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion and margins around 9.2%. 
For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure and that operating margins will be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year. 
So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion and the return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue but higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second, but much like the first, followed by a very strong fourth quarter. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO."
274561,374385898,1014640,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems gro",472,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group. And when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million had the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015, remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher. 
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. 
We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, but more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects the cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million for general corporate purposes to include share repurchases. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. 
In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full year rate right around 29%. 
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first 6 months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder friendly capital deployment, more than 2x our free cash flow for the first half. 
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this -- our market in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the 650 preowned market. So I've seen some folks saying there's going to be 20 or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with 1 pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5 of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a 650 used market. So in my mind, there should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near term availability rather than wait. So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that, that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So 650, so if you talk about by model, the 650 demand remains quite active. In our submarkets, subsections of the market, the 450 and 550 are, as we anticipated, during this period of transition to the 500 and 600, complicated the touch by competitor's overproduction. By the way, I might tell you that the 500 and 600 positions are sold to a lot of -- a lot of those positions are sold in '16 and '17. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America and I think the rest split between Mid East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order. Okay?"

So if you're suggesting that we have a gap, it's not an altogether bad thing, as long as we stay on schedule for our deliveries in the 400 -- or 500 and 600, which I see no reason why we can't at the moment.

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, an income from continuing operations of",1482,"Thanks, Erin, and good morning all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, an income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase. And income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase.
This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter [ph] that we have had those operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue was [ph] up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are [ph] essentially flat, [ph] and operating margin is down 20 basis points.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off [ph] $540 million at 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points, [ph] and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. [ph] Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year.
I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to aerospace as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had [ph] $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% in net income from continuing operations.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of $1.5 million option. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends [ph] in amounts in [ph] somewhat in [ph] excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year.
As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we expect $2.2 billion on share repurchases [ph] and dividends year-to-date compared to a [ph] free cash flow of [ph] $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these 2 years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash.
As you can see from the chart attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded.
Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue was down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter 2015, in line with the production cuts to the 450, [ph] 550 [ph] and, to a lesser extent, the 280 [ph] that we have previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter.
On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group.
On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but [ph] a $3 million improvement in operating earnings on 140 basis point improvement in margin. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. [ph] Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1% on 160 basis point improvement in [ph] operating margin.
On this last quarter -- on the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had [ph] strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measuring in dollar value of [ph] orders. [ph] Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar-value basis and 1.2:1 on a [ph] number of units [ph] basis. The distribution of these orders is also attractive, [ph] with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, [ph] and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look [ph] much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discreet [ph] third quarter since 2011 for orders.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue was off [ph] $15 million, [ph] but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million, [ph] and operating earnings are [ph] flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Combat Systems [ph] remains on course for a very good year, [ph] and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue. All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved our competitiveness, which positions us well for the future. We continue [ph] -- and for the rest of the [ph] year, by the way. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally, as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats; and domestically, as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment.
The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. [ph] However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has [ph] increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million is down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis [ph] in the quarter as a result of a onetime [ph] charge at FAS [ph] on their restart of the DDG 115 and 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well.
IS&T. [ph] Well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectation. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarters. [ph] Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $75 million, an [ph] 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
This is a very good news story, with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is [ph] concerned? [ph] Well, stronger-than-expected [ph] operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned [ph] tax rate and modestly lower share count enable [ph] us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for [ph] EPS from continuing operations [ph] goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This way [ph] in the year, we anticipate our ended year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance.
And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which is we give [ph] to you in January, is grounded in that process, [ph] and as a result, it's full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely tease [ph] you at this juncture.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy rela",450,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.
Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in [ph] our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in [ph] potential risk to the company. In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy, including the release of some rights for [ph] the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we progressed through the shipbuilding process, we [ph] determined that the costs [ph] associated with the settlement is greater than the party has [ph] anticipated. Therefore, we recognized [ph] an $84 million loss, [ph] net of taxes, to adjust the previously recognized settlement value.
As we discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by [ph] 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro [ph] and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long-term notes, our net debt [ph] position remains unchanged from the end of the [ph] second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion.
We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over [ph] to you for the Q&A."

So look, you asked about [ph] the regional distribution, [ph] and I think if we're stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the [ph] specific.

So look, you asked about [ph] the regional distribution, [ph] and I think if we're stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the [ph] specific. [ph] And let's start by talking about the market. And let me try to give you some insight into our market. Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, [ph] not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, [ph] including somewhat at [ph] Gulfstream, right? For the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition -- [ph] discussed with you previously during our transition from the 450 and 550 to 650 -- or 550 and 600 or 500 and 600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demand. So it would appear that we had [ph] been taking share from other than our space. And as the 500 and 600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant to -- in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about -- not about share, but really about profit. But it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how we're [ph] positioned going forward will help you. It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, [ph] any one particular region outside North America. And our demand consequently has not been as [ph] stated as other [ph] seems to be. So to give you a sense of, I think, where do we stand in the market and how we see it in general. Now let's dig down a little bit deeper in the Gulfstream, [ph] and let's just think about this. So from a Gulfstream perspective, again, as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in 5 years, [ph] and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and [ph] the pipeline are good. If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you [ph] a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timing of the [ph] certification. The 600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in '19. So why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests, [ph] and it should be certified and entered into service in 2017 [ph] as we have just talked about. The 600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service and all on schedule with some forward bias. Thinking about, again, this broadly, our market in Gulfstream, [ph] in particular, has [ph] always been of the view that a new plane [ph] 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production have a good start. Well, the 500 kind of exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider those sales force has been incentivized to focus on the 450 and 550. They're [ph] now being [ph] incentivized to turn their attention toward the 500. So with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a [ph] little bit about where we are in the used market. We see in the 650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, [ph] but as we deconstruct and analyze those [ph] potential aircraft, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some -- 203, actually, 650s that we've got into service. And we haven't seen any impact this [ph] quarter on new order activity or our [ph] order activity from the used market. And with respect to the 550, the used market is about 7% of the 700-or-so [ph] aircraft in service. And so we haven't been affected by that either. So I know that, that [ph] was rather soliloquy, but I think it's been [ph] -- your question about the distribution of [ph] our market, I think, was [ph] particularly -- just give me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more [ph] about the market, but I hope that helped.[ph]"

We've talked last year or so about the [ph] -- how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the 450 and 550 and then bring on the 500 and 600. And the key there is matching the ship set, the wings, the fuselage, the engines, with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the 150, [ph] for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the 450, [ph] and I expect the same thing on the 550. So I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable. That said, as we -- look, [ph] think about it, any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream is going to have, right, [ph] you're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic earning curves as we enter and start to produce and deliver 500 and 600. But I will tell you, if you look at the 650 by comparison, unless you see that [ph] as our baseline, the 650 margin performance was faster and higher than the 550 before it. So we've taken [ph] -- that means it's [ph] coming down this learning curve, [ph] and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever [ph] before. So the lessons that we have learned on the 650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the 500 and 600. And that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going to hit the ground running. We may have some margin compression as we begin to deliver. We come down those learning curves, but those -- our ability to come down those learning curves, as we demonstrated, I believe, is [ph] going to go much, much faster. And remember, too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the 500 and 600. So I suspect that the ignition coming down -- when we bring that 650 into full -- or 600 into full-rate [ph] production, it's going to be pretty impressive. I got to tell you, I like where we are, I like where we're headed. [ph] We're moving through this transition period [ph] like I told you we were going to do.

So that gives us the platform for some of this ignition and in terms of where we're focused on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities cross platform portfolio. Our business and space payload market, cyber, payload market, cyber, nuclear weapons and avionics. So I like where they are there. And on our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, not that you remember we also have incentives in there which will be a nice cost plus award fee program for 5 years and we like how that fits into our low-risk cash generating portfolio. And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up and we tend to announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So the diving board for that sort of -- for our growth is there in our backlog and because these businesses have really reduced their costs and increase their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now and I expect it to be going forward."

Let me give you a little bit, because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on on the Ohio replacement. We have been in the -- we have had the designed contract now for about 5 years and we're proceeding nicely at pace. And as you know, we had a prime contractor for the design for the sole contractor and the prime contractor for the construction. So our schedule is right on point to start the construction of the lead ship in 2021. And I would imagine that -- well, I expect that our profile on revenue within -- between now and 2021 where we'll really begin the real ignition will be driven by a couple of things, 1, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio and -- which will begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer, but starting perhaps '19, I think we're anticipating '19, we're likely to see a long lead production so we can actually -- we can actualize the ship productions construction in 2021. So as you know, these submarine programs take -- require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule. So to give you a sense of where we are in the design and the component development, well, we've proposed a detailed design and actually all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer. And they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year. And you know what, when you think about the large national strategic program, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the cost is well understood. So one of the things that we've been driving our work over the last 3 years is the bottom of analysis that the full process of construction. So that will be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious."

We had a robust education program in the trade with Rhode Island and Connecticut. And that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full rate production on schedule on the Ohio replacement and continue on Virginia class. Shipbuilding, one of the competitive advantages for shipbuilding is that detailed planning is physical and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for a decade and has demonstrated, yet again, in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy. And of course, our design work that we also have a lots of the Navy on. So these are all about preparing for success.

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, an income from continuing operations of $767",1428,"Thanks, Erin. Good morning all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, an income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase. And income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase.
This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue was up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat, and operating margin is down 20 basis points.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $540 million at 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points, and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year.
I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of $1.5 million option. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year.
As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these 2 years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash.
As you can see from the chart attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded.
Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue was down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter 2015, in line with the production cuts to the 450, 550 and, to a lesser extent, the 280 that we have previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest-ever revenue quarter.
On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest-ever margin for the group.
On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings on 140 basis point improvement in margin. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1% on 160 basis point improvement in operating margin.
On this last quarter -- on the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measuring in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar-value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis. The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue was off $15 million, but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million, and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Combat System remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue. All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved our competitiveness, which positions us well for the future. We continue -- and for the rest of the year, by the way. We continue to see opportunities for growth both internationally, as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats; and domestically, as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment.
The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well.
IS&T. Well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectation. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarters. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
This is a very good news story, with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance.
And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which is we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and was a result -- and as a result, it's full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely tease you at this juncture.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy rela",437,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.
Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company. In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy, including the release of some rights for the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we progressed through the shipbuilding process, we determined that the costs associated with the settlement is greater than the party has anticipated. Therefore, we recognize an $84 million loss, net of taxes, to adjust the previously recognized settlement value.
As we discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long-term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion.
We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think if we're stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market. And let me try to give you some insight into our market. Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? For the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition -- discussed with you previously during our transition from the 450 and 550 to 650 -- 550 and 600 -- 500 and 600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demand. So it would appear that we had been taking share from other than our space. And as the 500 and 600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant to -- in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about -- not about share but really about profit. But it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how we're positioned going forward will help you. It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand consequently has not been as [indiscernible] as other [indiscernible] seems to be. So to give you a sense of, I think, where we stand in the market and how we see it in general. Now let's dig down a little bit deeper in the Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So from a Gulfstream perspective, again, as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in 5 years, and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good. If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timing of the certification. The 600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in '19. So why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017 as the pilot we just talked about. The 600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service and all on schedule with some forward bias. Thinking about, again, this broadly, our market in Gulfstream, in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the 500 kind of exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider those sales force has been incentivized to focus on the 450 and 550. They're now being incentivized to turn their attention toward the 500. So with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see in the 650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircraft, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some -- 203, actually, 650s that we've got into service. And we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market. And with respect to the 550, the used market is about 7% of the 700-or-so aircraft in service. And so we haven't been affected by that either. So I know that, that was rather soliloquy, but I think it's been -- your question about the distribution of our market, I think, was particularly -- just gave me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more [indiscernible] about the market, but I hope that helped."

And so far, with the 150, for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the 450, and I expect the same thing on the 550. So I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable. That said, as we -- look, think about it, any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream is going to have, right, you're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic earning curves as we enter and start to produce and deliver 500 and 600. But I will tell you, if you look at the 650 by comparison, unless you see that as our baseline, the 650 margin performance was faster and higher than the 550 before it. So we've taken -- that means it's coming down this learning curve, and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before. So the lessons that we have learned on the 650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the 500 and 600. And that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going to hit the ground running. We may have some margin compression as we begin to deliver. We come down those learning curves, but those -- our ability to come down those learning curves as we demonstrated, I believe, is going to go much, much faster. And remember, too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the 500 and 600. So I suspect that the ignition coming -- when we bring that 650 into full -- or 600 into full-rate production is going to be pretty impressive. I got to tell you, I like where we are, I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do. And we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these 2 new airplanes into service."

So that gives us the platform for some of this ignition. And in terms of where we're focused on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities in -- across our platform portfolio, our ISR business in space payload market, cyber -- payload market, cyber nuclear weapons and avionics. So I like where they are there. On our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills, and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, not that -- you remember we also have incentives in there, which will be a nice cost-plus award fee program for 5 years. And we like how that fits into our low-risk cash-generating portfolio. And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up, and we tend to announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So the diving board for that sort of -- for our growth is there in our backlog. And because these businesses have really reduced their costs and increased their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now, and I expect it to be going forward."

Let me give you a little bit -- because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on, on the Ohio replacement. We have been in the -- we have had the design contract now for about 5 years, and we're proceeding nicely at pace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design, the sole contractor and the prime contractor for the construction. So our schedule is right on point to start the construction of the lead ship in 2021. And I would imagine that -- well, I expect that our profile on revenue within -- between now and 2021, where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things. One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio and -- which will begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in '19, and I think we're anticipating '19, we're likely to see a long lead production so we can actually -- we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So as you know, these submarine programs take -- require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule. So to give you a sense of where we are in the design and the component development, well, we have proposed a detailed design and actually all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer. And they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year. And when you think about the large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that we've been driving our work the last 3 years is a bottom of analysis of the full process of construction. So that will be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious."

Our design tools are mature. The design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to work -- we need to get our workforce because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trade with Rhode Island and Connecticut. And that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full-rate production on schedule on the Ohio replacement and continue on Virginia class. Shipbuilding -- one of the competitive advantages from shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for a decade and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy. And of course, our design works that we also have a lot of the Navy on. So this is all about preparing for success.

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, and income from continuing operations of $76",1431,"Thanks, Erin. Good morning all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, and income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase, and income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase.
This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue was up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat, and operating margin is down 20 basis points.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $540 million, a 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points, and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year.
I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of $1.5 million option. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year.
As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we have spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date, compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these 2 years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash.
As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded.
Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue was down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter 2015, in line with the production cuts to the 450, 550 and, to a lesser extent, the 280 that we have previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter.
On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group.
On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings on 140 basis point improvement in margin. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1% on 160 basis point improvement in operating margin.
On this last quarter -- on the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measuring in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis. The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue was off $15 million, but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million, and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Combat System remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue. All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved our competitiveness, which positions us well for the future. We continue -- and through the rest of the year, by the way. We continue to see opportunities for growth both internationally, as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats; and domestically, as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment.
The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well.
IS&T. Well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectation. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarters. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
This is a very good news story, with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance.
And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which, as we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and was a result -- and as a result, it's full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal at this juncture.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy rela",437,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.
Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company. In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy, including the release of some rights for the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we've progressed through the shipbuilding process, we've determined that the costs associated with the settlement is greater than the party has anticipated. Therefore, we recognize an $84 million loss, net of taxes, to adjust the previously recognized settlement value.
As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long-term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion.
We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

And let me try to give you some insight into our market.",795,"Yes. So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think if we're stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market. And let me try to give you some insight into our market. Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? For the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition -- discussed with you previously during our transition from the 450 and 550 to 650 -- 550 and 600 -- 500 and 600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demand. So it would appear that we have been taking share from other than our space, and as the 500 and 600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant to -- in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about -- not about share but really about profit. But it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how we're positioned going forward will help you. It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand consequently has not been as [indiscernible] as other [indiscernible] seems to be. So it gives you a sense of, I think, where we stand in the market and how we see it in general. Now let's dig down a little bit deeper in the Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So from a Gulfstream perspective, again, as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in 5 years, and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good. If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timing of the certification. The 600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in '19. So why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017 as implied by what we just talked about. The 600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service and all on schedule with some forward bias. Thinking about, again, this broadly, our market in Gulfstream in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the 500 is going to exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider those sales force has been incentivized to focus on the 450 and 550. They're now being incentivized to turn their attention toward the 500. So with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see in the 650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircraft, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some -- 203, actually, 650s that we've got into service. And we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market.

We've talked for last year or so about the -- how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the 450 and 550 and then bring on the 500 and 600. And the key there is matching the ship set, the wings, the fuselage, the engines, with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the 150, for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the 450, and I expect the same thing on the 550. So I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable. That said, as we -- look, just think about it, any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream is going to have, right, you're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic learning curves as we enter and start to produce and deliver 500s and 600s. But I will tell you, if you look at the 650 by comparison, and let's just use that as our baseline, the 650 margin performance was faster and higher than the 550 before it. So we've taken -- that means it's coming down this learning curve, and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before. So the lessons that we have learned on the 650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the 500 and 600. And that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going to hit the ground running. We may have some margin compression as we begin to deliver, as we come down those learning curves, but those -- our ability to come down those learning curves, as we demonstrated, I believe it's going to go much, much faster. And remember, too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the 500 and 600. So I suspect that the ignition coming -- when we bring that 650 into full -- or 600 into full-rate production is going to be pretty impressive. I got to tell you, I like where we are, I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do. And we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these 2 new airplanes into service."

So that gives us the platform for some of this ignition. And in terms of where we're focused on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities in -- across our platform portfolio, in our ISR business in space payload market, cyber -- payload market, cyber, nuclear weapons and avionics. So I like where they are there. On our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills, and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, not that -- you remember we also had the Census in there, which will be a nice cost-plus award fee program for 5 years. And we like how that fits into our low-risk cash-generating portfolio. And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up, and we tend to announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So the diving board for that sort of -- for our growth is there in our backlog. And because these businesses have really reduced their costs and increased their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now, and I expect it to be going forward."

We have been in the -- we have had the design contract now for about 5 years, and we're proceeding nicely apace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design, the sole contractor and the prime contractor for the construction. So our schedule is right on point to start the construction of the lead ship in 2021. And I would imagine that -- well, I expect that our profile on revenue within -- between now and 2021, where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things. One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio and -- which we'll begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in '19, and I think we're anticipating '19, we're likely to see a long lead production so we can actually -- we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So as you know, these submarine programs take -- require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule. So to give you a sense of where we are in the design and the component development, well, we have proposed a detailed design and actually all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer, and they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year. And when you think about the large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that we've been driving our work the last 3 years is a bottom up analysis of the full process of construction. So that will be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious."

And it is transformative. You put Ohio on top of Virginia, and there's going to be quite a lot of workload. So we have spent the last 5 years with getting our facilities in place. Our design tools are mature. The design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to work -- we need to get our workforce because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trades with Rhode Island and Connecticut. And that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full-rate production on schedule on the Ohio replacement and continue on Virginia class. Shipbuilding -- one of the competitive advantages in shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for decades, and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio.

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, and income from continuing operations of $76",1431,"Thanks, Erin. Good morning all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion, and income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase, and income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase.
This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue was up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat, and operating margin is down 20 basis points.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $540 million, a 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points, and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year.
I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of $1.5 million option. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year.
As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we have spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date, compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these 2 years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash.
As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded.
Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue was down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter 2015, in line with the production cuts to the 450, 550 and, to a lesser extent, the 280 that we have previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter.
On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group.
On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings on 140 basis point improvement in margin. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1% on 160 basis point improvement in operating margin.
On this last quarter -- on the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measuring in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1:1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis. The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue was off $15 million, but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million, and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Combat System remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue. All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved our competitiveness, which positions us well for the future. We continue -- and through the rest of the year, by the way. We continue to see opportunities for growth both internationally, as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats; and domestically, as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment.
The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well.
IS&T. Well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectation. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarters. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin.
This is a very good news story, with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance.
And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which, as we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and was a result -- and as a result, it's full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal at this juncture.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy rela",437,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations.
Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company. In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy, including the release of some rights for the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we've progressed through the shipbuilding process, we've determined that the costs associated with the settlement is greater than the party has anticipated. Therefore, we recognize an $84 million loss, net of taxes, to adjust the previously recognized settlement value.
As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long-term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion.
We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think if we're stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market. And let me try to give you some insight into our market.",795,"Yes. So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think if we're stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market. And let me try to give you some insight into our market. Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? For the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition -- discussed with you previously during our transition from the 450 and 550 to 650 -- 550 and 600 -- 500 and 600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demand. So it would appear that we have been taking share from other than our space, and as the 500 and 600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant to -- in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about -- not about share but really about profit. But it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how we're positioned going forward will help you. It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand consequently has not been as [indiscernible] as other [indiscernible] seems to be. So it gives you a sense of, I think, where we stand in the market and how we see it in general. Now let's dig down a little bit deeper in the Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So from a Gulfstream perspective, again, as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in 5 years, and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good. If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timing of the certification. The 600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in '19. So why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017 as implied by what we just talked about. The 600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service and all on schedule with some forward bias. Thinking about, again, this broadly, our market in Gulfstream in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the 500 is going to exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider those sales force has been incentivized to focus on the 450 and 550. They're now being incentivized to turn their attention toward the 500. So with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see in the 650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircraft, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some -- 203, actually, 650s that we've got into service. And we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market. And with respect to the 550, the used market is about 7% of the 700-or-so aircraft in service, and so we haven't been affected by that either. So I know that, that was rather a soliloquy, but I think it's been -- your question about the distribution of our market, I think was particularly -- just gave me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more wholesomely about the market, so I hope that helped."

We've talked for last year or so about the -- how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the 450 and 550 and then bring on the 500 and 600. And the key there is matching the ship set, the wings, the fuselage, the engines, with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the 150, for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the 450, and I expect the same thing on the 550. So I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable. That said, as we -- look, just think about it, any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream is going to have, right, you're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic learning curves as we enter and start to produce and deliver 500s and 600s. But I will tell you, if you look at the 650 by comparison, and let's just use that as our baseline, the 650 margin performance was faster and higher than the 550 before it. So we've taken -- that means it's coming down this learning curve, and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before. So the lessons that we have learned on the 650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the 500 and 600. And that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going to hit the ground running. We may have some margin compression as we begin to deliver, as we come down those learning curves, but those -- our ability to come down those learning curves, as we demonstrated, I believe it's going to go much, much faster. And remember, too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the 500 and 600. So I suspect that the ignition coming -- when we bring that 650 into full -- or 600 into full-rate production is going to be pretty impressive. I got to tell you, I like where we are, I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do. And we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these 2 new airplanes into service."

Let me give you a little bit -- because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on, on the Ohio replacement. We have been in the -- we have had the design contract now for about 5 years, and we're proceeding nicely apace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design, the sole contractor and the prime contractor for the construction. So our schedule is right on point to start the construction of the lead ship in 2021. And I would imagine that -- well, I expect that our profile on revenue within -- between now and 2021, where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things. One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio and -- which we'll begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in '19, and I think we're anticipating '19, we're likely to see a long lead production so we can actually -- we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So as you know, these submarine programs take -- require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule. So to give you a sense of where we are in the design and the component development, well, we have proposed a detailed design and actually all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer, and they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year. And when you think about the large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that we've been driving our work the last 3 years is a bottom up analysis of the full process of construction. So that will be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious."

The investments have primarily been funded by the Navy, but we will also and have been putting some of our capital in, and we'll continue to because -- look, we invest in lines of business that have high returns for us and good returns for us, and this is one of those lines of business. And it is transformative. You put Ohio on top of Virginia, and there's going to be quite a lot of workload. So we have spent the last 5 years with getting our facilities in place. Our design tools are mature. The design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to work -- we need to get our workforce because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trades with Rhode Island and Connecticut. And that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full-rate production on schedule on the Ohio replacement and continue on Virginia class. Shipbuilding -- one of the competitive advantages in shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for decades, and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy. And of course, our design work that we also are in lockstep with the Navy on. So this is all about preparing for success, and so far, so good."
