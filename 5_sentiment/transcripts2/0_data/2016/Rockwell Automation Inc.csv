With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith on the company's performance in the first quarter. Keith will also provide context around our outlook for fiscal '16. Then Ted will provide more details on the results as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about one hour today. 
Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. 
Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.

As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales",893,"Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry and markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad based across verticals. Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S., with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. 
I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continued to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry and markets globally impacted our Process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logix sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries, including oil and gas and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that Logix growth was 7% in the same quarter 1 year ago, so certainly a tough comp. And I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks. 
Let's move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast call for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated and only modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November, oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry and markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial production growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals. In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that we main nameplate overcapacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, Life Sciences and auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. 
In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest. 
Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries, including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance of $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance, and I'm sure you'll able to know this firsthand the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio, including our next-generation, high-performing architecture and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally. And our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Reader's Choice Awards, and once again, our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and 6 control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 1st Place awards. The next best recipient had only 12. We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable and multidisciplined integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation industry on us. And it is a good indicator of how far we have come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable, competitive differentiation. 
And while current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources and will continue to expand our served market and gain share. I'm very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000, and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency",1191,"Okay, thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. 
Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000, and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and a negative impact from currency. General corporate-net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full year tax rate guidance of 27%. 
Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow convention on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart. Architecture & Software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would noted that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for Architecture & Software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat. 
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter. 
Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in transportation and food and beverage but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry led by mining and oil and gas. EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA, and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving. 
Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year, with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low-double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3%, with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific. 
And that takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we're making some changes to guidance. We're dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately 1 point to reflect the more significant headwind from currency and an additional 1 point reduction to reflect the more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly on the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to 3 factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally, PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S., PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, the oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. And in the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we're not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term. Our previous guidance call for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%. That reflects the additional currency impact that's converting at a higher-than-normal rate. We talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S., both on average higher-margin parts of our business. 
We previously expected margin conversion on the year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned. We're revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40 to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement to the tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind and about than $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower-margin expectation. 
We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. A couple of other items. We now expect general corporate-net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to $131 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A."

We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas. Obviously, metals, cement, mining, all of those are very challenging at this point in time. And we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tires been a major downturn this last quarter and last probably almost up to a year now. But the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we're seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, those are still the smaller pieces of our business. So I think challenging in the broadest sense, but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. I was just there a little over a week ago, and I'm very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they're doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That's their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they're going to improve their competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. And we believe that connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey to that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sectors. So we're encouraged in the long term, and I think right now, we're just seeing a period of time where they're rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments. And as we know from the previous 5-year plan that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. And I think that once again played the very strongly into the sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter."

We believe that given everything we seen that while the industrial economy is struggling, the consumer is still spending, and I just saw a report that consumer confidence has gone up again. So we're not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S., is definitely weakened since our last quarter and that was what was behind our change in our guidance. But right now, the expectation is, is that we will not see a recession. Obviously, you know that our visibility is limited in 2/3 of our business. But when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it's not pointing to that at this point in time, and so that's how we structured our business going forward.

If we go to Asia, in particular, China, while the China sales have been slowing and, in some cases, slightly negative depending upon the auto company, we're still seeing investment in China automotive. We see once again the need to continue to automate to take cost out of their operations, and auto is one of the places that we'll see that. And we're also seeing a lot of interest in what we can do with respect to our operational intelligence software to help them improve the asset utilization and efficiencies and effectiveness of their manufacturing plant floors. So there, we think it's great. As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investments in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil is struggling now given the economy. And we're not seeing significant investments in Western Europe at this point in time either. So that's how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis. Canada, a little more investment, quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar, and the currency has improved Canada's competitiveness in automotive and there's a little more activity there than previously."

They have a much higher control concentration and architecture concentration than they do than the heavy industries because the heavy industries have a lot of solutions built by Rockwell and they have a lot of intelligent motor control, which is the heavy asset. Critical assets are a bigger part of the expenditure in those industries, so it's a mix more than anything else. And our software and our automation is the predominant purchase of the consumer, including automotive companies. So yes, but it's because of the way automation and the intensiveness of automation in those industries."

And the follow-up is basically, if you -- I think from a high level if you look at Rockwell, A&S margins, which were obviously very high before, right, are coming under some pressure. And this is against the backdrop where, Keith, you just mentioned the word mix. We're obviously against the backdrop with very tough markets globally where pricing is increasingly becoming a factor. Now I know that Rockwell in the past you don't really compete on price. It's not the nature of discrete automation, but could you talk to the mix context for A&S because you may not be seeing price, but maybe you're seeing people swap into lower priced or margin solutions. Like I guess, the question is obviously just from a high level, what are the risk that A&S margins go from where it was to materially lower in the coming quarters even if your sales are still relatively resilient?"

And I think that is not a critical issue. I think the bigger issue for A&S is going to be value and then the exchange rates. Those are the 2 more compelling concerns that we would have at this time as opposed to overall mix in the segment. And certainly, with the high margins throughout that segment, volume declines are very impactful. And you saw some degree this quarter, the volume, the impact of FX changes that come about as well, particularly in some of the currencies that are, I'll say, different than just the traditional euro, U.S. dollar or Canadian, U.S. dollar, which is the ones that we have a greater concentration in."

It was -- we talked about productivity last year, and that was kind of disproportionately on the CP&S side and we's are continuing to see some of that to your benefit in Q1. I think the other thing that influenced this is, I mentioned that Architecture & Software is the segment that bears the largest burden of the currency conversion problem that will go out, and CP&S doesn't really face a lot of that because of their more balanced supply chain, particularly because of the solutions and services business where we have the people resources deployed all over the world, so we get better match across currencies."

I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry and markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad based across verticals. Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S., with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. 
I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continue to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry and markets globally impacted our Process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logix sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries, including oil and gas, and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that Logix growth was 7% in the same quarter 1 year ago, so certainly a tough comp. And I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks. 
Let's move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast call for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, and only a modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November, oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry end markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial production growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals. In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that we name plate with overcapacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, Life Sciences and Auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. 
In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest. 
Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year, led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries, including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance to $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance, and I'm sure you were able to know this firsthand, the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio, including our next-generation, high-performing architecture and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally. And our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Reader's Choice Awards, and once again, our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and 6 control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 1st Place awards. The next best recipient had only 12. We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable and multi-disciplined integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation professionals. And it is a good indicator of how far we've come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable, competitive differentiation. 
And while current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources, and will continue to expand our served market and gain share. I'm very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000 and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency t",1191,"Okay, thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. 
Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000 and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and a negative impact from currency. General corporate-net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full year tax rate guidance of 27%.  Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart. Architecture & Software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would note that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for Architecture & Software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat. 
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter. 
Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected, as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in transportation, and food and beverage but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry led by mining, and oil and gas. EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA, and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving. 
Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year, with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low-double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3%, with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific. 
And that takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we're making some changes to guidance. We're dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately 1 point to reflect the more significant headwind from currency and an additional 1 point reduction to reflect the more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly on the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to 3 factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally, PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S., PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. And in the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we're not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term. Our previous guidance call for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%. That reflects the additional currency impact that's converting at a higher-than-normal rate. We talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S., both on average, higher-margin parts of our business. 
We previously expected margin conversion on the year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned. We're revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40 to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement due to the tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind and about an $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower-margin expectation. 
We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. 
A couple of other items. We now expect general corporate-net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to $131 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A."

We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas. Obviously, metals, cement, mining, all of those are very challenging at this point in time, and we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tire's been a major downturn this last quarter and last, probably, almost up to a year now. And -- but the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we're seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, that those are still the smaller pieces of our business. So I think challenging in the broadest sense, but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. I was just there a little over a week ago, and I'm very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they're doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That's their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they're going to improve their competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. And we believe that connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey to that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sectors. So we're encouraged in the long term, and I think right now, we're just seeing a period of time where they're rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments and as we know from the previous 5-year plan, that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. And I think that once again played very strongly into the sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter."

We believe that given everything we've seen that while the industrial economy is struggling, the consumer is still spending, and I just saw a report that consumer confidence has gone up again. So we're not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S., is definitely weakened since our last quarter, and that was what was behind our change in our guidance. But right now, the expectation is, is that we will not see a recession. Obviously, you know that our visibility is limited in 2/3 of our business. But when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it's not pointing to that at this point in time and so that's how we've structured our business going forward.

We see once again the need to continue to automate to take cost out of their operations, and auto is one of the places that we'll see that. And we're also seeing a lot of interest in what we can do with respect to our operational intelligence software to help them improve the asset utilization and efficiencies and effectiveness of their manufacturing plant floor. So there, we think it's great. As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investment in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil is struggling now given the economy. And we're not seeing significant investments in Western Europe at this point in time either. So that's how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis. Canada, a little more investment, quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar, and the currency has improved Canada's competitiveness in automotive and there's a little more activity there than previously."

So that's why we have such a positive outlook for the long term, and that's part of the reasons why we need to keep investing during this period because we do see the demand for what we're doing as something that is not going to disappear from a cyclical standpoint."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.

I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry and markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad based across verticals. Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S., with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. 
I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continue to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry and markets globally impacted our Process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logix sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries, including oil and gas, and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that Logix growth was 7% in the same quarter 1 year ago, so certainly a tough comp. And I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks. 
Let's move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, and only modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November, oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry end markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial production growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals. In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that remain plate with overcapacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, Life Sciences and Auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. 
In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest. 
Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year, led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries, including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance to $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance, and I'm sure you were able to know this firsthand, the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio, including our next-generation, high-performing architecture and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally. And our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Reader's Choice Awards, and once again, our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and 6 control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 1st Place awards. The next best recipient had only 12. We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable and multi-disciplined integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation professionals. And it is a good indicator of how far we have come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable, competitive differentiation. 
And while current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources, and will continue to expand our served market and gain share. I'm very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000 and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency t",1192,"Okay, thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. 
Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000 and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and a negative impact from currency. General corporate-net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full year tax rate guidance of 27%.  Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are a couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart. Architecture & Software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would note that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for Architecture & Software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat. 
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter. 
Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected, as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in transportation, and food and beverage but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry led by mining, and oil and gas. EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA, and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving. 
Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year, with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low-double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3%, with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific. 
And that takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we're making some changes to guidance. We're dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately 1 point to reflect the more significant headwind from currency and an additional 1 point reduction to reflect the more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly on the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to 3 factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally, PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S., PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. And in the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we're not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term. Our previous guidance call for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%. That reflects the additional currency impact that's converting at a higher-than-normal rate. We talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S., both on average, higher-margin parts of our business. 
We previously expected margin conversion on the year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned. We're revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40 to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement due to the tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind and about an $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower-margin expectation. 
We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. 
A couple of other items. We now expect general corporate-net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to $131 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A."

We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas. Obviously, metals, cement, mining, all of those are very challenging at this point in time, and we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tire's been a major downturn this last quarter and last, probably, almost up to a year now. And -- but the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we're seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, that those are still the smaller pieces of our business. So I think challenging in the broadest sense, but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. I was just there a little over a week ago, and I'm very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they're doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That's their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they're going to improve their competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. And we believe that connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey to that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sectors. So we're encouraged in the long term, and I think right now, we're just seeing a period of time where they're rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments and as we know from the previous 5-year plan, that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. And I think that once again played very strongly into the sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter."

So we're not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S., is definitely weakened since our last quarter, and that was what was behind our change in our guidance. But right now, the expectation is, is that we will not see a recession. Obviously, you know that our visibility is limited in 2/3 of our business. But when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it's not pointing to that at this point in time and so that's how we've structured our business going forward.

So there, we think it's great. As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investment in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil is struggling now given the economy. And we're not seeing significant investments in Western Europe at this point in time either. So that's how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis. Canada, a little more investment, quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar, and the currency has improved Canada's competitiveness in automotive and there's a little more activity there than previously."

And so that bodes well for continued investment and continued modernization of their platform. So we aren't anticipating a significant change in the automotive outlook, particularly in the U.S. With respect to penetration, we believe, as we've talked a couple of times, our best opportunities for increased penetration is in powertrain, and we think that's an area where there'll be continued investment because of the need to continue to achieve the fuel guidelines that are being mandated now over the next -- the coming 5-plus years. So most of the investment and improvements are going to have to come in engines and transmissions, and so we see a healthy pipeline of powertrain.

Now I know that Rockwell, in the past you don't really compete on price, it's not the nature of discrete automation. But could you talk to the mix context for A&S because you may not be seeing price, but maybe you're seeing people swap into lower priced or margin solutions.

I think the other thing that influenced this is, I mentioned that Architecture & Software is the segment that bears the largest burden of the currency conversion problem that we've got, and CP&S doesn't really face a lot of that because of their more balanced supply chain, particularly because of the solutions and services business where we have the people resources deployed all over the world, so we get better match across currencies."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.

I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry and markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad based across verticals. Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S., with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. 
I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continue to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry and markets globally impacted our Process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logix sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries, including oil and gas, and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that Logix growth was 7% in the same quarter 1 year ago, so certainly a tough comp. And I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks. 
Let's move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, and only modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November, oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry end markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial production growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals. In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that remain plate with overcapacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, Life Sciences and Auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. 
In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest. 
Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year, led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries, including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance to $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance, and I'm sure you were able to know this firsthand, the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio, including our next-generation, high-performing architecture and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally. And our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Reader's Choice Awards, and once again, our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and 6 control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 1st Place awards. The next best recipient had only 12. We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable and multi-disciplined integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation professionals. And it is a good indicator of how far we have come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable, competitive differentiation. 
And while current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources, and will continue to expand our served market and gain share. I'm very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

Good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 4, the first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000 and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000 and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and a negative impact from currency. General corporate-net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full year tax rate guidance of 27%. Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are a couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart. Architecture & Software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would note that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for Architecture & Software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat. 
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter. 
Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected, as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in transportation, and food and beverage but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry led by mining, and oil and gas. EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA, and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving. 
Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year, with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low-double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3%, with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific. 
And that takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we're making some changes to guidance. We're dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately 1 point to reflect the more significant headwind from currency and an additional 1 point reduction to reflect the more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly on the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to 3 factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally, PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S., PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. And in the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we're not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term. Our previous guidance call for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%. That reflects the additional currency impact that's converting at a higher-than-normal rate. We talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S., both on average, higher-margin parts of our business. 
We previously expected margin conversion on the year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned. We're revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40 to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement due to the tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind and about an $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower-margin expectation. 
We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. 
A couple of other items. We now expect general corporate-net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to $131 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A."

We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas. Obviously, metals, cement, mining, all of those are very challenging at this point in time, and we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tire's been a major downturn this last quarter and last, probably, almost up to a year now. And -- but the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we're seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, that those are still the smaller pieces of our business. So I think challenging in the broadest sense, but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. I was just there a little over a week ago, and I'm very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they're doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That's their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they're going to improve their competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. And we believe that connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey to that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sectors. So we're encouraged in the long term, and I think right now, we're just seeing a period of time where they're rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments and as we know from the previous 5-year plan, that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. And I think that once again played very strongly into the sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter."

But my first comment would be, I'm not an economist, so I think I can predict the economy about as good as we can forecast every -- our future performance given our short-cycle business, which is really the point I wanted to make. We believe that given everything we've seen that while the industrial economy is struggling, the consumer is still spending, and I just saw a report that consumer confidence has gone up again. So we're not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S., is definitely weakened since our last quarter, and that was what was behind our change in our guidance. But right now, the expectation is, is that we will not see a recession. Obviously, you know that our visibility is limited in 2/3 of our business. But when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it's not pointing to that at this point in time and so that's how we've structured our business going forward. And certainly, given what happened over the last quarter from the outlook standpoint, we're definitely looking at what do we need to be ready for in case this view changes over the remainder of our fiscal year."

If we go to Asia, in particular, China, while the China sales have been slowing and, in some cases, slightly negative depending upon the auto company, we're still seeing investment in China automotive. We see once again the need to continue to automate to take cost out of their operations, and auto is one of the places that will see that. And we're also seeing a lot of interest in what we can do with respect to our operational intelligence software to help them improve the asset utilization and efficiencies and effectiveness of their manufacturing plant floor. So there, we think it's great. As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investment in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil is struggling now given the economy. And we're not seeing significant investments in Western Europe at this point in time either. So that's how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis. Canada, a little more investment, quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar, and the currency has improved Canada's competitiveness in automotive and there's a little more activity there than previously."

It was -- we talked a lot about productivity last year, and that was kind of disproportionately on the CP&S side and we're continuing to see some of that year-over-year benefit in Q1. I think the other thing that influenced this is, I mentioned that Architecture & Software is the segment that bears the largest burden of the currency conversion problem that we've got, and CP&S doesn't really face a lot of that because of their more balanced supply chain, particularly because of the solutions and services business where we have the people resources deployed all over the world, so we get better match across currencies."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.

I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry end markets continue to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad based across verticals. Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S., with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. 
I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continue to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry end markets globally impacted our process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logix sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries including oil and gas and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that Logix growth was 7% in the same quarter 1 year ago, so certainly a tough comp. And I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks. 
Let's move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, and only modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November, oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry end markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial production growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals. In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that remain plagued with overcapacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, life sciences and auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. 
In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest. Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. 
Taking all of these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance to $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance, and I'm sure you were able to notice firsthand the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio including our next-generation high performance architecture and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally. And our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Readers Choice Awards, and once again, our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and 6 control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 first place awards. The next best recipient had only 12. We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable multi-discipline integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation professionals. And it is a good indicator of how far we have come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable competitive differentiation. 
And while current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources, and will continue to expand our served market and gain share. I'm very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

Sales in the quarter were $1,427,000,000. That was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and a negative impact from currency. General corporate net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full year tax rate guidance of 27%. Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are a couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%. Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would note that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for Architecture & Software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat. 
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter. 
Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected, as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in transportation and food and beverage, but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry led by mining and oil and gas. EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA, and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving. 
Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year, with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3%, with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific. 
And that takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we're making some changes to guidance. We're dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately 1 point to reflect the more significant headwind from currency and an additional 1-point reduction to reflect a more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly on the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to 3 factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally, PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S., PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. And in the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we're not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term. 
Our previous guidance called for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%. That reflects the additional currency impact that's converting at a higher-than-normal rate. We talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S., both on average higher margin parts of our business. 
We previously expected margin conversion on the year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned. We're revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40 to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement due to the tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind and about an $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower margin expectation. 
We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. 
A couple of other items. We now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to $131 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A."

But I would say that, at this point, we do not believe we're underperforming the underlying market. We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas. Obviously, metals, cement, mining, all of those are very challenging at this point in time, and we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tire's been a major downturn this last quarter and last -- probably almost up to a year now. And -- but the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we're seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, that those are still the smaller pieces of our business. So I think challenging, in the broadest sense, but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. I was just there a little over a week ago, and I'm very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they're doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That's their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they're going to improve their competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. And we believe the connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey to that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sectors. So we're encouraged in the long term, and I think right now, we're just seeing a period of time where they're rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments. And as we know from the previous 5-year plan, that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. And I think that, once again, plays very strongly into the sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter."

But my first comment would be, I'm not an economist, so I think I can predict the economy about as good as we can forecast every -- our future performance given our short-cycle business, which is really the point I wanted to make. We believe that given everything we've seen that while the industrial economy is struggling, the consumer is still spending, and I just saw a report that consumer confidence has gone up again. So we're not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S., is definitely weakened since our last quarter, and that was what was behind our change in our guidance. But right now, the expectation is, is that we will not see a recession. Obviously, you know that our visibility is limited in 2/3 of our business. But when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it's not pointing to that at this point in time and so that's how we structured our business going forward. And certainly, given what happened over the last quarter from the outlook standpoint, we are definitely looking at what do we need to be ready for in case this view changes over the remainder of our fiscal year."

We see, once again, the need to continue to automate to take costs out of their operations, and auto is one of the places that we'll see that. And we're also seeing a lot of interest in what we can do with respect to our operational intelligence software to help them improve the asset utilization and efficiencies and effectiveness of their manufacturing plant floor. So there, we think it's great. As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investment in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil is struggling now given the economy. And we're not seeing significant investments in western Europe at this point in time either. So that's how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis. Canada, a little more investment, quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar, and the currency has improved Canada's competitiveness in automotive and there's a little more activity there than previously."

So we aren't anticipating a significant change in the automotive outlook, particularly in the U.S. With respect to penetration, we believe, as we've talked a couple of times, our best opportunities for increased penetration is in powertrain, and we think that's an area where there'll be continued investment because of the need to continue to achieve the fuel guidelines that are being mandated now over the next -- the coming 5-plus years.

I suspect by now that you have read the press release that was issued last week, Tuesday. I will be stepping down from the role of President and CEO of Rockwell Automation on June 30 and effective July 1, will succeed me and become President and CEO of the company. I will remain Chairman of the Board. Blake [ph] has been with the company for over 30 years and has gathered a wealth of experience across the organization, including sales management, business management positions in both segments and international assignments. He brings a strong customer focus as well as a deep understanding of our values, people and technology. He has proven himself to be an exceptional leader with demonstrated readiness to lead the company. Blake is the ideal executive to move our company forward.
I know many of you have had the opportunity to meet Blake over the last few years. In the coming months, we will find the opportunities for Blake to meet with investors in his new role. With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.
The quarter generally played out as we expected with organic sales down about 3.5%. Heavy industry end markets remained very weak globally, led by oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas was down a little over 20% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Consumer and auto verticals saw mid-single-digit growth. In the U.S., oil and gas again was the weakest vertical. The U.S. is the region where we have seen the largest decline in oil and gas. Food and beverage was one of the stronger verticals and automotive was flat.
In China, strong growth in automotive was more than offset by continued weakness in heavy industries and tire. Sales in China were down a little over 10% year-over-year. Clearly, the U.S. and China remain our most challenging geographies. However, sales in both the U.S. and China increased modestly compared to last quarter.
EMEA was about flat in the quarter but no backlog. We expect to return to low single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Home and personal care and life sciences remain the strongest verticals in this region. I am pleased with continued strength in Latin America led by Mexico. Let me add another couple of points on the quarter. Weak heavy industries continued to affect our process business, which was down high teens in the quarter. Logix sales declined over 5% in the quarter, reflecting the weakness in process industries and segment margin was 19.3% in the quarter. This is a bit lower than we expected. However, I was pleased that the Control Products & Solutions segment maintained its margin despite lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 financial performance, including our segment margins in his results -- in his remarks.
Let me add a couple of brief comments about our first half before moving on to our outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 3.5%, heavy industry verticals were down globally and growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the U.S. and China. I am pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20% despite 8% lower sales and we are very proud to have received the award for the eighth time, naming us as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity.
Let's move on to what I expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated but continued in the take of modest improvement for the second half of our fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in January, oil and commodity prices seem to have stabilized. Another welcome change is the stability and modest weakening of the U.S. dollars since January as we mentioned last quarter. The strong U.S. dollar has adversely impacted U.S.-based producers and equipment builders. 
So given that the macro environment has remained relatively stable, we believe that our performance in the balance of the year will be in line with what we projected in January, modest sequential improvements but no year-over-year growth. Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak with some continued growth in the consumer and automotive verticals. The U.S. and China will remain our weakest geographies. We expect continued growth in EMEA and believe Latin America will remain our fastest growth region for the year.
Taking all these factors into consideration and with 2 quarters to go, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance range to down 1.5% to 4.5%. No change to the midpoint. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 sales of about $5.9 billion and are narrowing the EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $6.15. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few closing comments. As I travel and meet with customers and partners around the world, I am confident that our vision of the connected enterprise is coming to life. Early adoption of our new technology is promising and customers realize that our new high performance architecture optimizes their business performance and makes them more globally competitive. Whether our customer is focused on expansion or productivity, CapEx or OpEx, our technology is equally relevant. Innovation, new product development and domain expertise are the lifeblood of our company and we continue to invest to enhance our differentiation. 
I am very excited about the connected enterprise and could not be more confident about the future success of Rockwell Automation. With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

I'll begin my comments on Page 4, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6% that's similar",994,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments on Page 4, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6% that's similar to the organic decline that we saw in Q1. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.5%. This quarter, we lap lack some of the larger currency rate differences. Segment operating margin was 19.3%, down 2.3 points from Q2 last year, primarily due to lower sales, some unfavorable mix, primarily in the Architecture & Software segment and a negative impact from currency.
General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q2 compared to $21 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.37, down $0.22 or about 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% compared to 26% in Q2 last year, the lower effective rate this year is primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax items. Free cash flow for Q2 was $203 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 113%. Through 6 months, free cash flow was $348 million with related conversion on adjusted income of 92%.
Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32%. A couple of items not shown on slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 101.3 million, down over 3% compared to last year. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $127 million. Through the first 6 months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. In November, we projected repurchases for the full year totaling 500 million, were on that pace. At the end of March, we had $197 million remaining on our then existing share repurchase authorization and on April 4, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment and I'll focus my comments on the quarter.
Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $630 million in Q2, down 6.6% compared to Q2 last year. The organic sales decline was 3.3% and currency translation also reduced sales by 3.3%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 24.6% down 5.2 points from Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower sales volume, negative currency effects, some mix headwinds within the segment and increased spending. The margin result was about a point worse than we expected in the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, the largest unfavorable mix factor is related to a larger decline in the controller and software businesses compared to the balance of the segment. The controller and software businesses are the highest margin business within this high-margin segment.
As expected, spending is also up modestly year-over-year in Architecture & Software despite sales being down. The spending increase is primarily related to new product development and we remain committed to investment in key technologies even in these more difficult market conditions.
We expect to see continued mix headwind in the Architecture & Software segment over the balance of the year. However, we expect some sequential sales growth into the second half and consequently expect Q2 to be our lowest margin quarter this year in this segment.
Moving to Page 6. The Control Products & Solutions segment. In the second quarter, control products and solutions sales were $811 million, down 7.5% year-over-year and down 3.9% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%. Sales in the product businesses and the solutions and services businesses within the segment were each down about 4% organically. The book-to-bill in Q2 for solutions and services was 0.98, that's weaker than we expected and reflects continued weakness in heavy industries. The Control Products & Solutions continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.2% in Q2, flat to Q2 last year despite the lower sales.
Turning to Page 7. This provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter and year-to-date. Keith covered the quarter in his comments and the year-to-date performance pretty much mirrors the second quarter so I'll move to the next slide. And that takes us to guidance. As Keith mentioned, there are a couple of adjustments to the guidance. We've narrowed the range for both organic sales and adjusted EPS, that's pretty typical for us to do at this point in the year. 
Organic growth, the midpoint remains at minus 3% but the new range is minus 1.5% to minus 4.5%. For currency translation due to a recent weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to several currencies, we now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3% rather than about 4% in the previous guidance. That takes us back to the level of the original November guidance. We still expect reported sales to be about $5.9 billion with the improvement in currency translation, we went from a little below that number to little above that number. 
Regarding segment operating margin, we now expect that to be a little lower than 20.5%. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. we're narrowing adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.75 to $6.15 with the same $5.95 midpoint. We continue to expect to convert about 100% of adjusted income to free cash flow and there are a couple of items not shown here. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session."

And the specific question on auto for the quarter was that it was up 3% and I don't think I said that, but that was the number. So it was one of the offsets to some of our heavy industry declines if you will. What we're seeing in auto is continued high levels of investment. There's a lot of platform investments that is going on. We also see continued investment in Mexico by many of the U.S. and European and Asian auto producers. We're seeing continued strength in China in the core automotive companies that we deal with. There's still many fringe companies that are struggling. Western Europe amount there is still is very slow, not a lot of growth there. And Brazil, given the recession, it has been a difficult market and we're seeing declines and projects being put on hold in Brazil. I think the other piece to the question is probably, you were thinking is powertrain. We continue to see improvements in powertrain. We are winning more projects. We have increased their commitments in powertrain over the last 12 to 18 months and we still see that as a good opportunity for us going forward. And that's an area that we believe there will be ongoing investments and a place where we'll be able to grow shares. So that's pretty much that color around auto."

So I think in the past, generally we don't talk about the mix, it's been about products, businesses versus solutions and services. But within the Architecture & Software segment, our controller and software businesses have a pretty balanced exposure across heavy industry, auto and consumer that's pretty similar to the overall company average in terms of the exposure. The balance of the Architecture & Software segment, and particularly our motion control sensing and safety business, are much more auto and consumer-centric. So with the significant decline we're seeing in heavy industry, and with our process business down 18% year-over-year in Q2 and with auto and consumer showing modest growth, the bigger declines in the segment are coming in the controller and software businesses. So that is principally what's causing that mix issue and I would say in that regard, look, there's always going to be some normal variability and mix on a quarterly basis."

We also believe that your comment about Logix, 2 points to make. We do expect Logix to be a little bit below the A&S average. As Ted outlined earlier, why that shift is occurring? It's really because of the end market performance with the other areas within the A&S segment. I would say the opportunities to continue to see growth will be the expansion of our footprint in the OEM sector, mainly because of some of the new introductions, CompactLogix and the capabilities of integrated motion and safety in that platform. We believe that will allow us to create more opportunities in that space. And the other with the heavy industry as the process starts coming back, we'd expect to see a better impact in the performance of our ControlLogix business in that sector. And then as we continue to build out the high performance architecture and the connected enterprise, we see that as a great growth opportunities for our hardware platforms of which Logix would be front and center there."

However, our growth in Mexico is very broad-based. It includes are quite candidly heavy industries. We're growing in oil and gas and in fact, the only place we have a positive growth in oil and gas is Mexico. We have mining activities there. Auto is one, but we also -- there's tire investments going there, supporting auto, water/wastewater, consumer. It's a very broad diverse economy. So I do want to leave the impression that it was automotive-driven. And we had phenomenal growth the last couple of quarters and the last couple of years throughout Latin America. And Mexico now has taken over the lead there with the issues in Brazil, but we see a continued growth opportunity, it's going to be hard to match the first 2 quarters in the remainder of the year, but we still believe that Latin America will be our highest growth region over the next 2 quarters. So we continue to create opportunities there. We are very hopeful that with Argentina and the change that is going on there, that will see more positive, a matter of fact, that is one of the areas we're seeing more interests in companies thinking about making investments than 6 to 12 months ago. We're also seeing in the Ambien region, the need to or continue to spend some money on OpEx and small productivity projects in the mining industries, obviously because the share price -- because the commodity price is there. Its important that they continue to drive costs out. So I would say the greatest challenge remains Venezuela and Brazil, and those will be the greatest challenges in Latin America."

So that's why we've maintained the overall organic growth rate for the year. And Rick, as it relates to the 0.98, that's below what we thought it would be in the quarter but we were thinking of a number more like 1.03, 1.04, so it wasn't too dramatically lower."

But we now have more than 10 pilots and rollouts that are going on at key customers in multiple industries. We're doing in mining, in metals, in automotive and tire, in food, home and personal care, diversified industrials, consumer, multi-industry companies and quite candidly, in our own Rockwell Automation journey on the connected enterprise. So I would say what we're seeing customers doing are starting to implement their journey of digitizing their enterprise. And they're willing to spend at this point on learning and creating value and demonstrating that value in a portion of their business. We have only 1 or 2 major, I'll say company or multiplan, multi-geography rollouts that are going on. But the majority of it is, testing of the concepts, of the integration of IT and OT, and that convergence and how they can also be thinking about this from reducing -- improving their asset utilization in the plant floor, and they're willing to spend money in that. And they're also trying to think about how does this extend more broadly into their entire supply chain? And so that is what we're seeing at this point in time and with the introduction of the high performance architecture and the ability to do realtime integrated control and information, that is the foundation of where they're starting to do this. And its about conversations and dialogues across multidiscipline organization. So our meetings now are with the IT organization, the senior leadership of companies as they're trying to understand what their broader strategy should be and of course, the automation teams where we're traditionally focused. So it's working with different parts of the organization. It's delivering on business outcomes as opposed to simply the productivity from automation. And that's a characterization of where we're at, at this point in time and it's an area that we think will continue to develop over the next couple of years and we'll see the pace of it increase down the road."

Blake has been with the company for over 30 years and has gathered a wealth of experience across the organization, including sales management, business management positions in both segments and international assignments.

I know many of you have had the opportunity to meet Blake over the last few years. In the coming months, we will find the opportunities for Blake to meet with investors in his new role.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter generally played out as we expected with organic sales down about 3.5%. Heavy industry end markets remained very weak globally, led by oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas was down a little over 20% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Consumer and auto verticals saw low to mid-single-digit growth. In the U.S., oil and gas, again, was the weakest vertical. The U.S. is the region where we have seen the largest decline in oil and gas. Food and beverage was one of the stronger verticals and automotive was flat.
In China, strong growth in automotive was more than offset by continued weakness in heavy industries and tire. Sales in China were down a little over 10% year-over-year. Clearly, the U.S. and China remain our most challenging geographies. However, sales in both the U.S. and China increased modestly compared to last quarter.
EMEA was about flat in the quarter, but no backlog. We expect to return to low single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Home and personal care and life sciences remain the strongest verticals in this region. I am pleased with continued strength in Latin America, led by Mexico.
Let me add another couple of points on the quarter. Weak heavy industries continued to affect our process business, which was down high teens in the quarter. Logix sales declined over 5% in the quarter, reflecting the weakness in process industries, and segment margin was 19.3% in the quarter. This is a bit lower than we expected. However, I was pleased that the Control Products & Solutions segment maintained its margin despite lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 financial performance, including our segment margins in his results -- in his remarks, excuse me.
Let me add a couple of brief comments about our first half before moving on to our outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 3.5%, heavy industry verticals were down globally and growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the U.S. and China. I am pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20% despite 8% lower sales, and we are very proud to have received the Ethisphere award for the eighth time, naming us as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity.
Let's move on to what I expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, but continued in the take on modest improvement for the second half of our fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in January, oil and commodity prices seem to have stabilized. Another welcome change is the stability and modest weakening of the U.S. dollars since January, as we mentioned last quarter. The strong U.S. dollar has adversely impacted U.S.-based producers and equipment builders.
So given that the macro environment has remained relatively stable, we believe that our performance in the balance of the year will be in line with what we projected in January, modest sequential improvements, but no year-over-year growth. Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak with some continued growth in the consumer and automotive verticals. The U.S. and China will remain our weakest geographies. We expect continued growth in EMEA and believe Latin America will remain our fastest growth region for the year.
Taking all these factors into consideration and with 2 quarters to go, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance range to down 1.5% to 4.5%. No change to the midpoint. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 sales of about $5.9 billion and are narrowing the EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $6.15. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few closing comments. As I travel and meet with customers and partners around the world, I am confident that our vision of the connected enterprise is coming to life. Early adoption of our new technology is promising, and customers realize that our new high performance architecture optimizes their business performance and makes them more globally competitive. Whether our customer is focused on expansion or productivity, CapEx or OpEx, our technology is equally relevant. Innovation, new product development and domain expertise are the lifeblood of our company, and we continue to invest to enhance our differentiation.
I am very excited about the connected enterprise and could not be more confident about the future success of Rockwell Automation.
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

I'll begin my comments on Page 4, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6%, that's similar to the organic decline that we saw in Q1. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.5%. This quarter, we lapped some of the larger currency rate differences. Segment operating margin was 19.3%, down 2.3 points from Q2 last year, primarily due to lower sales, some unfavorable mix, primarily in the Architecture & Software segment, and a negative impact from currency.
General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q2 compared to $21 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.37, down $0.22 or about 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% compared to 26% in Q2 last year, the lower effective rate this year is primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax item. Free cash flow for Q2 was $203 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 113%. Through 6 months, free cash flow was $348 million with related conversion on adjusted income of 92%.
Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32%. A couple of items not shown on slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 101.3 million, down over 3% compared to last year. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $127 million. Through the first 6 months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. In November, we projected repurchases for the full year totaling 500 million, we're on that pace. At the end of March, we had $197 million remaining on our then existing share repurchase authorization, and on April 4, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment, and I'll focus my comments on the quarter.
Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $630 million in Q2, down 6.6% compared to Q2 last year. The organic sales decline was 3.3%, and currency translation also reduced sales by 3.3%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 24.6%, down 5.2 points from Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower sales volume, negative currency effects, some mix headwinds within the segment and increased spending. The margin result was about 1 point worse than we expected in the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, the largest unfavorable mix factor is related to a larger decline in the controller and software businesses compared to the balance of the segment. The controller and software businesses are the highest margin business within this high-margin segment.
As expected, spending is also up modestly year-over-year in Architecture & Software despite sales being down. The spending increase is primarily related to new product development, and we remain committed to investment in key technologies, even in these more difficult market conditions.
We expect to see continued mixed headwind in the Architecture & Software segment over the balance of the year. However, we expect some sequential sales growth into the second half and consequently expect Q2 to be our lowest margin quarter this year in this segment.
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the second quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $811 million, down 7.5% year-over-year and down 3.9% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%. Sales in the product businesses and the solutions and services businesses within the segment were each down about 4% organically. The book-to-bill in Q2 for solutions and services was 0.98, that's weaker than we expected and reflects continued weakness in heavy industries. The Control Products & Solutions segment continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.2% in Q2, flat to Q2 last year despite the lower sales.
Turning to Page 7. This provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter and year-to-date.
Keith covered the quarter in his comments, and the year-to-date performance pretty much mirrors the second quarter, so I'll move to the next slide, and that takes us to guidance. As Keith mentioned, there are a couple of adjustments to the guidance. We've narrowed the range for both organic sales and adjusted EPS, that's pretty typical for us to do at this point in the year. Organic growth, the midpoint remains at minus 3%, but the new range is minus 1.5% to minus 4.5%. For currency translation, due to a recent weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to several currencies, we now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3% rather than about 4% in the previous guidance. That takes us back to the level of the original November guidance. We still expect reported sales to be about $5.9 billion. With the improvement in currency translation, we went from a little below that number to little above that number.
Regarding segment operating margin, we now expect that to be a little lower than 20.5%. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We're narrowing adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.75 to $6.15 with the same $5.95 midpoint. We continue to expect to convert about 100% of adjusted income to free cash flow, and there are a couple of items not shown here. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session."

Consumer and auto would be the 2 areas that we anticipate the above the company average and positive growth. And the specific question on auto for the quarter was that it was up 3%, and I don't think I said that, but that was the number. So it was one of the offsets to some of our heavy industry declines, if you will. What we're seeing in auto is continued high levels of investment. There's a lot of platform investments that is going on. We also see continued investment in Mexico by many of the U.S. and European and Asian auto producers. We're seeing continued strength in China in the core automotive companies that we deal with. There's still many fringe companies that are struggling. Western Europe still is very slow, not a lot of growth there. And Brazil, given the recession, it has been a difficult market, and we're seeing declines and projects being put on hold in Brazil. I think the other piece to the question is -- probably you were thinking is powertrain. We continue to see improvements in powertrain. We are winning more projects. We have increased the commitments in powertrain over the last 12 to 18 months, and we still see that as a good opportunity for us going forward. And that's an area that we believe there will be ongoing investments and a place where we'll be able to grow shares. So that's pretty much the color around auto."

So I think in the past, generally, when it was talked about the mix, it's been about product businesses versus solutions and services. But within the Architecture & Software segment, our controller and software businesses have a pretty balanced exposure across heavy industry, auto and consumer, that is pretty similar to the overall company average in terms of the exposure. The balance of the Architecture & Software segment, and particularly our motion control, sensing and safety businesses are much more auto and consumer-centric. So with the significant decline we're seeing in heavy industry, and with our process business down 18% year-over-year in Q2, and with auto and consumer showing modest growth, the bigger declines in the segment are coming in the controller and software businesses. So that is principally what's causing that mix issue, and I would say in that regard, look, there's always going to be some normal variability and mix on a quarterly basis."

We also believe that your comment about Logix, 2 points to make. We do expect Logix to be a little bit below the A&S average, as Ted outlined earlier. Why that shift is occurring? It's really because of the end market performance with the other areas within the A&S segment. I would say the opportunities to continue to see growth will be the expansion of our footprint in the OEM sector, mainly because of some of the new introductions of CompactLogix and the capabilities of integrated motion and safety in that platform. We believe that will allow us to create more opportunities in that space, and the other would be heavy industry. As the process starts coming back, we expect to see a better impact in performance of our ControlLogix business in that sector.

Our growth in Mexico is very broad-based. It includes, quite candidly, heavy industries. We're growing in oil and gas, and matter of fact, oil -- the only place we have a positive growth in oil and gas is Mexico. We have mining activities there. Auto is one, but we also -- there's tire investments going there, supporting auto, water/wastewater, consumer. It's a very broad diverse economy. So I do want to leave the impression that it was automotive-driven. And we've had phenomenal growth the last couple of quarters and the last couple of years throughout Latin America. And Mexico now has taken over the lead there with the issues in Brazil, but we see a continued growth opportunity, it's going to be hard to match the first 2 quarters in the remainder of the year, but we still believe that Latin America will be our highest growth region over the next 2 quarters. So we continue to create opportunities there. We are very hopeful that with Argentina and the change that is going on there, that we'll see more positive. Matter of fact, that is one of the areas where we're seeing more interests in companies thinking about making investments than 6 to 12 months ago. We're also seeing in the Ambien region, the need to continue to spend some money on OpEx and small productivity projects in the mining industries, obviously, because of the share price -- because the commodity prices there. It's important that they continue to drive costs out. So I would say the greatest challenge remains Venezuela and Brazil, and those will be the greatest challenges in Latin America."

We're doing it in mining, in metals, in automotive and tire, in food, home and personal care, diversified industrials, consumer, multi-industry companies and quite candidly, in our own Rockwell Automation journey on the connected enterprise. So I would say what we're seeing customers doing are starting to implement their journey of digitizing their enterprise. And they're willing to spend at this point on learning and creating value and demonstrating that value in a portion of their business. We have only 1 or 2 major, I'll say, company or multiplan, multi-geography rollouts that are going on, but the majority of it is testing of the concepts of the integration of IT and OT, that convergence, and how they can also be thinking about this from reducing -- improving their asset utilization on the plant floor, and they're willing to spend money in that. And they're also trying to think about how does this extend more broadly into their entire supply chain? And so that is what we're seeing at this point in time and with the introduction of the high performance architecture and the ability to do realtime integrated control and information, that is the foundation of where they're starting to do this. And its about conversations and dialogues across multidisciplines in their organization. So our meetings now are with the IT organizations, the senior leadership of companies as they're trying to understand what their broader strategy should be and of course, the automation teams where we're traditionally focused. So it's working with different parts of the organization, it's delivering on business outcomes as opposed to simply the productivity from automation.

I suspect by now that you have read the press release that was issued last week, Tuesday. I will be stepping down from the role of President and CEO of Rockwell Automation on June 30 and effective July 1, Blake Moret will succeed me and become President and CEO of the company. I will remain Chairman of the Board. Blake has been with the company for over 30 years and has gathered a wealth of experience across the organization, including sales management, business management positions in both segments and international assignments. He brings a strong customer focus as well as a deep understanding of our values, people and technology. He has proven himself to be an exceptional leader with demonstrated readiness to lead the company. Blake is the ideal executive to move our company forward. I know many of you have had the opportunity to meet Blake over the last few years. In the coming months, we will find the opportunities for Blake to meet with investors in his new role.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter generally played out as we expected with organic sales down about 3.5%. Heavy industry end markets remained very weak globally, led by oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas was down a little over 20% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Consumer and auto verticals saw low to mid-single-digit growth. In the U.S., oil and gas, again, was the weakest vertical. The U.S. is the region where we have seen the largest decline in oil and gas. Food and beverage was one of the stronger verticals and automotive was flat.
In China, strong growth in automotive was more than offset by continued weakness in heavy industries and tire. Sales in China were down a little over 10% year-over-year. Clearly, the U.S. and China remain our most challenging geographies. However, sales in both the U.S. and China increased modestly compared to last quarter.
EMEA was about flat in the quarter, but no backlog. We expect to return to low single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Home and personal care and life sciences remained the strongest verticals in this region. I am pleased with continued strength in Latin America, led by Mexico.
Let me add another couple of points on the quarter. Weak heavy industries continued to affect our process business, which was down high teens in the quarter. Logix sales declined over 5% in the quarter, reflecting the weakness in process industries, and segment margin was 19.3% in the quarter. This is a bit lower than we expected. However, I was pleased that the Control Products & Solutions segment maintained its margin despite lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 financial performance, including our segment margins in his results -- in his remarks, excuse me.
Let me add a couple of brief comments about our first half before moving on to our outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 3.5%, heavy industry verticals were down globally and growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the U.S. and China. I am pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20% despite 8% lower sales, and we are very proud to have received the Ethisphere award for the eighth time, naming us as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity.
Let's move on to what I expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, but continued to indicate some modest improvement for the second half of our fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in January, oil and commodity prices seem to have stabilized. Another welcome change is the stability and modest weakening of the U.S. dollar since January, as we mentioned last quarter. The strong U.S. dollar has adversely impacted U.S.-based producers and equipment builders.
So given that the macro environment has remained relatively stable, we believe that our performance in the balance of the year will be in line with what we projected in January, modest sequential improvements, but no year-over-year growth. Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak with some continued growth in the consumer and automotive verticals. The U.S. and China will remain our weakest geographies. We expect continued growth in EMEA and believe Latin America will remain our fastest growth region for the year.
Taking all these factors into consideration and with 2 quarters to go, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance range to down 1.5% to 4.5%. No change to the midpoint. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 sales of about $5.9 billion and are narrowing the EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $6.15. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few closing comments. As I travel and meet with customers and partners around the world, I am confident that our vision of the connected enterprise is coming to life. Early adoption of our new technology is promising, and customers realize that our new high performance architecture optimizes their business performance and makes them more globally competitive. Whether a customer is focused on expansion or productivity, CapEx or OpEx, our technology is equally relevant. Innovation, new product development and domain expertise are the lifeblood of our company, and we continue to invest to enhance our differentiation.
I am very excited about the connected enterprise and could not be more confident about the future success of Rockwell Automation.
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

I'll begin my comments on Page 4, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6%, that's similar to the organic decline that we saw in Q1. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.5%. This quarter, we lapped some of the larger currency rate differences. Segment operating margin was 19.3%, down 2.3 points from Q2 last year, primarily due to lower sales, some unfavorable mix, primarily in the Architecture & Software segment, and a negative impact from currency.
General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q2 compared to $21 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.37, down $0.22 or about 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% compared to 26% in Q2 last year, the lower effective rate this year is primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax item. Free cash flow for Q2 was $203 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 113%. Through 6 months, free cash flow was $348 million with related conversion on adjusted income of 92%.
Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32%. A couple of items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 101.3 million, down over 3% compared to last year. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $127 million. Through the first 6 months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. In November, we projected repurchases for the full year totaling 500 million, we're on that pace. At the end of March, we had $197 million remaining on our then existing share repurchase authorization, and on April 4, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment, and I'll focus my comments on the quarter.
Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $630 million in Q2, down 6.6% compared to Q2 last year. The organic sales decline was 3.3%, and currency translation also reduced sales by 3.3%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 24.6%, down 5.2 points from Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower sales volume, negative currency effects, some mix headwinds within the segment and increased spending. The margin result was about 1 point worse than we expected in the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, the largest unfavorable mix factor is related to a larger decline in the controller and software businesses compared to the balance of the segment. The controller and software businesses are the highest margin business within this high-margin segment.
As expected, spending is also up modestly year-over-year in Architecture & Software despite sales being down. The spending increase is primarily related to new product development, and we remain committed to investment in key technologies, even in these more difficult market conditions.
We expect to see continued mixed headwind in the Architecture & Software segment over the balance of the year. However, we expect some sequential sales growth into the second half and consequently expect Q2 to be our lowest margin quarter this year in this segment.
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the second quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $811 million, down 7.5% year-over-year and down 3.9% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%. Sales in the product businesses and the solutions and service businesses within the segment were each down about 4% organically. The book-to-bill in Q2 for solutions and services was 0.98, that's weaker than we expected and reflects continued weakness in heavy industries. The Control Products & Solutions segment continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.2% in Q2, flat to Q2 last year despite the lower sales.
Turning to Page 7. This provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter and year-to-date.
Keith covered the quarter in his comments, and the year-to-date performance pretty much mirrors the second quarter, so I'll move to the next slide, and that takes us to guidance. 
As Keith mentioned, there are a couple of adjustments to the guidance. We've narrowed the range for both organic sales and adjusted EPS, that's pretty typical for us to do at this point in the year. Organic growth, the midpoint remains at minus 3%, but the new range is minus 1.5% to minus 4.5%. For currency translation, due to a recent weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to several currencies, we now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3% rather than about 4% in the previous guidance. That takes us back to the level of the original November guidance. We still expect reported sales to be about $5.9 billion. With the improvement in currency translation, we went from a little below that number to little above that number.
Regarding segment operating margin, we now expect that to be a little lower than 20.5%. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We're narrowing adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.75 to $6.15 with the same $5.95 midpoint. We continue to expect to convert about 100% of adjusted income to free cash flow, and there are a couple of items not shown here. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session."

And the specific question on auto for the quarter was that it was up 3%, and I don't think I said that, but that was the number. So it was one of the offsets to some of our heavy industry declines, if you will. What we're seeing in auto is continued high levels of investment. There's a lot of platform investment that is going on. We also see continued investment in Mexico by many of the U.S. and European and Asian auto producers. We're seeing continued strength in China in the core automotive companies that we deal with. There's still many fringe companies that are struggling. Western Europe still is very slow, not a lot of growth there. And Brazil, given the recession, it has been a difficult market, and we're seeing declines and projects being put on hold in Brazil. I think the other piece to the question is -- probably you were thinking is powertrain. We continue to see improvements in powertrain. We are winning more projects. We have increased the commitments in powertrain over the last 12 to 18 months, and we still see that as a good opportunity for us going forward. And that's an area that we believe there will be ongoing investments and a place where we'll be able to grow share. So that's pretty much the color around auto."

So I think in the past, generally, when we've talked about mix, it's been about product businesses versus solutions and services. But within the Architecture & Software segment, our controller and software businesses have a pretty balanced exposure across heavy industry, auto and consumer, that is pretty similar to the overall company average in terms of the exposure. The balance of the Architecture & Software segment, and particularly our motion control, sensing and safety businesses are much more auto and consumer-centric. So with the significant decline we're seeing in heavy industry, and with our process business down 18% year-over-year in Q2, and with auto and consumer showing modest growth, the bigger declines in the segment are coming in the controller and software businesses. So that is principally what's causing that mix issue, and I would say in that regard, look, there's always going to be some normal variability in mix on a quarterly basis."

Oil and gas was what we expected, but the other heavy industries, particularly mining and metals, was a little worse, and that's what triggered the decline. We also believe that your comment about Logix, 2 points to make. We do expect Logix to be a little bit below the A&S average, as Ted outlined earlier. Why that shift is occurring? It's really because of the end market performance with the other areas within the A&S segment. I would say the opportunities to continue to see growth will be the expansion of our footprint in the OEM sector, mainly because of some of the new introductions of CompactLogix and the capabilities of integrated motion and safety in that platform. We believe that will allow us to create more opportunities in that space, and the other would be heavy industry. As the process starts coming back, we expect to see a better impact in performance of our ControlLogix business in that sector. And then as we continue to build out the high-performance architecture and the connected enterprise, we see that as great growth opportunities for our hardware platforms, of which Logix would be front and center there."

Our growth in Mexico is very broad-based. It includes, quite candidly, heavy industries. We're growing in oil and gas, and matter of fact, oil -- the only place we have a positive growth in oil and gas is Mexico. We have mining activities there. Auto is one, but we also -- there's tire investments going there, supporting auto, water/wastewater, consumer. It's a very broad, diverse economy. So I don't want to leave the impression that it was automotive-driven. And we've had phenomenal growth the last couple of quarters and the last couple of years throughout Latin America. And Mexico now has taken over the lead there with the issues in Brazil, but we see a continued growth opportunity, it's going to be hard to match the first 2 quarters in the remainder of the year, but we still believe that Latin America will be our highest growth region over the next 2 quarters. So we continue to create opportunities there. We are very hopeful that with Argentina and the change that is going on there, that we'll see more positive. Matter of fact, that is one of the areas where we're seeing more interest in companies thinking about making investments than 6 to 12 months ago. We're also seeing in the Andean region, the need to continue to spend some money on OpEx and small productivity projects in the mining industries, obviously, because of the share prices -- because the commodity prices there. It's important that they continue to drive costs out. So I would say the greatest challenge remains Venezuela and Brazil, and those will be the greatest challenges in Latin America."

But we now have more than 10 pilots and rollouts that are going on at key customers in multiple industries. We're doing it in mining, in metals, in automotive and tire, in food, home and personal care, diversified industrials, consumer, multi-industry companies and quite candidly, in our own Rockwell Automation journey on the connected enterprise. So I would say what we're seeing customers doing are starting to implement their journey of digitizing their enterprise. And they're willing to spend at this point on learning and creating value and demonstrating that value in a portion of their business. We have only 1 or 2 major, I'll say, company or multiplanned, multi-geography rollouts that are going on, but the majority of it is testing of the concepts of the integration of IT and OT, that convergence, and how they can also be thinking about this from reducing -- improving their asset utilization on the plant floor, and they're willing to spend money in that. And they're also trying to think about how does this extend more broadly into their entire supply chain? And so that is what we're seeing at this point in time and with the introduction of the high performance architecture and the ability to do realtime integrated control and information, that is the foundation of where they're starting to do this. And it's about conversations and dialogues across multidisciplines in their organization. So our meetings now are with the IT organizations, the senior leadership of companies as they're trying to understand what their broader strategy should be and of course, the automation teams where we're traditionally focused. So it's working with different parts of the organization, it's delivering on business outcomes as opposed to simply the productivity from automation. And that's a characterization of where we're at, at this point in time, and it's an area that we think we'll continue to develop over the next couple of years, and we'll see the pace of it increase down the road."

I suspect by now that you have read the press release that was issued last week, Tuesday. I will be stepping down from the role of President and CEO of Rockwell Automation on June 30 and effective July 1, Blake Moret will succeed me and become President and CEO of the company. I will remain Chairman of the Board. Blake has been with the company for over 30 years and has gathered a wealth of experience across the organization, including sales management, business management positions in both segments and international assignments. He brings a strong customer focus as well as a deep understanding of our values, people and technology. He has proven himself to be an exceptional leader with demonstrated readiness to lead the company. Blake is the ideal executive to move our company forward. I know many of you have had the opportunity to meet Blake over the last few years. In the coming months, we will find the opportunities for Blake to meet with investors in his new role.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter generally played out as we expected with organic sales down about 3.5%. Heavy industry end markets remained very weak globally, led by oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas was down a little over 20% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Consumer and auto verticals saw low to mid-single-digit growth. In the U.S., oil and gas, again, was the weakest vertical. The U.S. is the region where we have seen the largest decline in oil and gas. Food and beverage was one of the stronger verticals and automotive was flat.
In China, strong growth in automotive was more than offset by continued weakness in heavy industries and tire. Sales in China were down a little over 10% year-over-year. Clearly, the U.S. and China remain our most challenging geographies. However, sales in both the U.S. and China increased modestly compared to last quarter.
EMEA was about flat in the quarter, but no backlog. We expect to return to low single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Home and personal care and life sciences remained the strongest verticals in this region. I am pleased with continued strength in Latin America, led by Mexico.
Let me add another couple of points on the quarter. Weak heavy industries continued to affect our process business, which was down high teens in the quarter. Logix sales declined over 5% in the quarter, reflecting the weakness in process industries, and segment margin was 19.3% in the quarter. This is a bit lower than we expected. However, I was pleased that the Control Products & Solutions segment maintained its margin despite lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 financial performance, including our segment margins in his results -- in his remarks, excuse me.
Let me add a couple of brief comments about our first half before moving on to our outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 3.5%, heavy industry verticals were down globally and growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the U.S. and China. I am pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20% despite 8% lower sales, and we are very proud to have received the Ethisphere award for the eighth time, naming us as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity.
Let's move on to what I expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, but continued to indicate some modest improvement for the second half of our fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in January, oil and commodity prices seem to have stabilized. Another welcome change is the stability and modest weakening of the U.S. dollar since January, as we mentioned last quarter. The strong U.S. dollar has adversely impacted U.S.-based producers and equipment builders.
So given that the macro environment has remained relatively stable, we believe that our performance in the balance of the year will be in line with what we projected in January, modest sequential improvements, but no year-over-year growth. Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak with some continued growth in the consumer and automotive verticals. The U.S. and China will remain our weakest geographies. We expect continued growth in EMEA and believe Latin America will remain our fastest growth region for the year.
Taking all these factors into consideration and with 2 quarters to go, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance range to down 1.5% to 4.5%. No change to the midpoint. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 sales of about $5.9 billion and are narrowing the EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $6.15. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few closing comments. As I travel and meet with customers and partners around the world, I am confident that our vision of the connected enterprise is coming to life. Early adoption of our new technology is promising, and customers realize that our new high performance architecture optimizes their business performance and makes them more globally competitive. Whether a customer is focused on expansion or productivity, CapEx or OpEx, our technology is equally relevant. Innovation, new product development and domain expertise are the lifeblood of our company, and we continue to invest to enhance our differentiation.
I am very excited about the connected enterprise and could not be more confident about the future success of Rockwell Automation.
With that, let me turn it over to Ted."

I'll begin my comments on Page 4, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,440,000,000, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6%, that's similar to the organic decline that we saw in Q1. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.5%. This quarter, we lapped some of the larger currency rate differences. Segment operating margin was 19.3%, down 2.3 points from Q2 last year, primarily due to lower sales, some unfavorable mix, primarily in the Architecture & Software segment, and a negative impact from currency.
General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q2 compared to $21 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.37, down $0.22 or about 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% compared to 26% in Q2 last year, the lower effective rate this year is primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax item. Free cash flow for Q2 was $203 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 113%. Through 6 months, free cash flow was $348 million with related conversion on adjusted income of 92%.
Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 32%. A couple of items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 101.3 million, down over 3% compared to last year. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $127 million. Through the first 6 months, we've repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. In November, we projected repurchases for the full year totaling 500 million, we're on that pace. At the end of March, we had $197 million remaining on our then existing share repurchase authorization, and on April 4, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
The next 2 slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. Page 5 is the Architecture & Software segment, and I'll focus my comments on the quarter.
Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $630 million in Q2, down 6.6% compared to Q2 last year. The organic sales decline was 3.3%, and currency translation also reduced sales by 3.3%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. On the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 24.6%, down 5.2 points from Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower sales volume, negative currency effects, some mix headwinds within the segment and increased spending. The margin result was about 1 point worse than we expected in the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, the largest unfavorable mix factor is related to a larger decline in the controller and software businesses compared to the balance of the segment. The controller and software businesses are the highest margin business within this high-margin segment.
As expected, spending is also up modestly year-over-year in Architecture & Software despite sales being down. The spending increase is primarily related to new product development, and we remain committed to investment in key technologies, even in these more difficult market conditions.
We expect to see continued mixed headwind in the Architecture & Software segment over the balance of the year. However, we expect some sequential sales growth into the second half and consequently expect Q2 to be our lowest margin quarter this year in this segment.
Moving to Page 6, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the second quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $811 million, down 7.5% year-over-year and down 3.9% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%. Sales in the product businesses and the solutions and service businesses within the segment were each down about 4% organically. The book-to-bill in Q2 for solutions and services was 0.98, that's weaker than we expected and reflects continued weakness in heavy industries. The Control Products & Solutions segment continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.2% in Q2, flat to Q2 last year despite the lower sales.
Turning to Page 7. This provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter and year-to-date.
Keith covered the quarter in his comments, and the year-to-date performance pretty much mirrors the second quarter, so I'll move to the next slide, and that takes us to guidance. 
As Keith mentioned, there are a couple of adjustments to the guidance. We've narrowed the range for both organic sales and adjusted EPS, that's pretty typical for us to do at this point in the year. Organic growth, the midpoint remains at minus 3%, but the new range is minus 1.5% to minus 4.5%. For currency translation, due to a recent weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to several currencies, we now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3% rather than about 4% in the previous guidance. That takes us back to the level of the original November guidance. We still expect reported sales to be about $5.9 billion. With the improvement in currency translation, we went from a little below that number to little above that number.
Regarding segment operating margin, we now expect that to be a little lower than 20.5%. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We're narrowing adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.75 to $6.15 with the same $5.95 midpoint. We continue to expect to convert about 100% of adjusted income to free cash flow, and there are a couple of items not shown here. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session."

I mean, I think that's why we said we had -- we built backlog last quarter, and we expect growth for the full year, the remainder of the year, and we had a very good first quarter in Europe. So I would say that we are seeing improvement there, and that's been driven from both emerging Europe and then specific countries in mature Western Europe, particularly now that the south has come back a little better; strength in Italy, particularly in some of the home and personal care OEM segment; France has turned positive as well as Spain. So we do see that improvement, but it is also modest growth at this point."

Consumer and auto would be the 2 areas that we anticipate the above the company average and positive growth. And the specific question on auto for the quarter was that it was up 3%, and I don't think I said that, but that was the number. So it was one of the offsets to some of our heavy industry declines, if you will. What we're seeing in auto is continued high levels of investment. There's a lot of platform investment that is going on. We also see continued investment in Mexico by many of the U.S. and European and Asian auto producers. We're seeing continued strength in China in the core automotive companies that we deal with. There's still many fringe companies that are struggling. Western Europe still is very slow, not a lot of growth there. And Brazil, given the recession, it has been a difficult market, and we're seeing declines and projects being put on hold in Brazil. I think the other piece to the question is -- probably you were thinking is powertrain. We continue to see improvements in powertrain. We are winning more projects. We have increased the commitments in powertrain over the last 12 to 18 months, and we still see that as a good opportunity for us going forward. And that's an area that we believe there will be ongoing investments and a place where we'll be able to grow share. So that's pretty much the color around auto."

So I think in the past, generally, when we've talked about mix, it's been about product businesses versus solutions and services. But within the Architecture & Software segment, our controller and software businesses have a pretty balanced exposure across heavy industry, auto and consumer, that is pretty similar to the overall company average in terms of the exposure. The balance of the Architecture & Software segment, and particularly our motion control, sensing and safety businesses are much more auto and consumer-centric. So with the significant decline we're seeing in heavy industry, and with our process business down 18% year-over-year in Q2, and with auto and consumer showing modest growth, the bigger declines in the segment are coming in the controller and software businesses. So that is principally what's causing that mix issue, and I would say in that regard, look, there's always going to be some normal variability in mix on a quarterly basis."

It's really because of the end market performance with the other areas within the A&S segment. I would say the opportunities to continue to see growth will be the expansion of our footprint in the OEM sector, mainly because of some of the new introductions of CompactLogix and the capabilities of integrated motion and safety in that platform. We believe that will allow us to create more opportunities in that space, and the other would be heavy industry.

Our growth in Mexico is very broad-based. It includes, quite candidly, heavy industries. We're growing in oil and gas, and matter of fact, oil -- the only place we have a positive growth in oil and gas is Mexico. We have mining activities there. Auto is one, but we also -- there's tire investments going there, supporting auto, water/wastewater, consumer. It's a very broad, diverse economy. So I don't want to leave the impression that it was automotive-driven. And we've had phenomenal growth the last couple of quarters and the last couple of years throughout Latin America. And Mexico now has taken over the lead there with the issues in Brazil, but we see a continued growth opportunity, it's going to be hard to match the first 2 quarters in the remainder of the year, but we still believe that Latin America will be our highest growth region over the next 2 quarters. So we continue to create opportunities there. We are very hopeful that with Argentina and the change that is going on there, that we'll see more positive. Matter of fact, that is one of the areas where we're seeing more interest in companies thinking about making investments than 6 to 12 months ago. We're also seeing in the Andean region, the need to continue to spend some money on OpEx and small productivity projects in the mining industries, obviously, because of the share prices -- because the commodity prices there. It's important that they continue to drive costs out. So I would say the greatest challenge remains Venezuela and Brazil, and those will be the greatest challenges in Latin America."

We're doing it in mining, in metals, in automotive and tire, in food, home and personal care, diversified industrials, consumer, multi-industry companies and quite candidly, in our own Rockwell Automation journey on the connected enterprise. So I would say what we're seeing customers doing are starting to implement their journey of digitizing their enterprise. And they're willing to spend at this point on learning and creating value and demonstrating that value in a portion of their business. We have only 1 or 2 major, I'll say, company or multiplanned, multi-geography rollouts that are going on, but the majority of it is testing of the concepts of the integration of IT and OT, that convergence, and how they can also be thinking about this from reducing -- improving their asset utilization on the plant floor, and they're willing to spend money in that. And they're also trying to think about how does this extend more broadly into their entire supply chain? And so that is what we're seeing at this point in time and with the introduction of the high performance architecture and the ability to do realtime integrated control and information, that is the foundation of where they're starting to do this. And it's about conversations and dialogues across multidisciplines in their organization. So our meetings now are with the IT organizations, the senior leadership of companies as they're trying to understand what their broader strategy should be and of course, the automation teams where we're traditionally focused. So it's working with different parts of the organization, it's delivering on business outcomes as opposed to simply the productivity from automation.

And obviously, that's the goal, you hit it on the head. It's about how do you -- how can you take what we're doing and translate it to the marketing front-end. And that's why I mentioned the broad list of customers that we're currently working with by industry, because many of these are lighthouse accounts -- lighthouse customers that are viewed as market leaders.

As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month, while Pete remains Chairman of our board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity.
As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith's generated exceptional financial returns for share owners during his tenure.
On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way, by focusing on long-term customer value and rocksolid integrity.
So certainly, big shoes to fill, but I am very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners, we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above market revenue growth and superior financial returns.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.
The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about 1 point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked up compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially, but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. 
Globally, the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remained challenging, with oil and gas and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow.
Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline. 
In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally, but particularly in heavy industry end markets, affecting our solutions and services businesses.
In China, conditions remained stable, and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down midteens in the quarter. I am encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year. 
EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I am particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region.
In Latin America, sales were up 8%, led by Mexico where strength remains broad based across most verticals.
Let me add a few comments about the quarter. 
Our process business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year, but grew 4% sequentially. And I am pleased that, as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%. 
Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks.
Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
We expect continued improvement in our products sales. But the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April.
Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals.
Taking all of these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, 1 point lower than our April guidance, and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6. 
Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. 
Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year. 
But here are some initial points. Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers best opportunities for productivity, combining our differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience.
Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customers share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality.
Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above market growth will come from share gains, new value from the connected enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy.
We are very well-positioned to bring the connected enterprise to life for our customers given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value. And I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements.
Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out, and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continued to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers everyday as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers.
With that, Ted?"

I'll start on Page 4, third quarter key financial information.
Sales in the quarter were $1,474,000,000, 6.4% lower than Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 4.8%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.8%. As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations.
Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation costs. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points.
General Corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized that favorable discrete tax items in the current quarter and were also benefiting the share from the R&D tax credit.
Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%. 
A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million.
In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We are running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1,075,000,000 remaining under the previous share repurchase authorizations.
The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results.
On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation costs. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points.
Turning to Page 6. This is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year. On a reported basis, with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%. 
On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in this segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. The decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected, and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada.
The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly, in the U.S., we saw larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and we expect this trend in delays to continue to Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter.
CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation costs.
Moving to the next slide. Page 7 provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and it shows organic growth results for the quarter and the 9 months through June. 
As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific, with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional color, so I'll just add a couple of notes. 
We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total emerging market organic sales, with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%.
Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year '16 guidance.
So as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and the order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the related reduced outlook for Q4, we are reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%.
You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about[ph] $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year, but still at about minus 3%.
We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continued to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced topline.
We now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about 0.5 point lower than previous guidance and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier.
Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts, but basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales will be mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate.
We continued to expect about 100% conversion of adjusted income to free cash flow. 
There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continued to expect General Corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A."

And so the functionality that I talked about for a machine builder, those same products include the functionality that enables that higher level productivity. So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They are using our new products, some of our recent contact Logix releases, motion, power flex drives, to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks. And we can remotely monitor that line and 100 other lines around the world to benchmark performance and maximize uptime. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plant floor drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value. So they are starting to -- they're starting small so that they can have a discrete opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out and each customers going to move at their own pace, so we're very encouraged by the early progress."

As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month, while Pete remains Chairman of our board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity.
As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith's generated exceptional financial returns for share owners during his tenure.
On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way by focusing on long-term customer value and rock solid integrity.
So certainly, big shoes to fill, but I am very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners, we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above market revenue growth and superior financial returns.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about 1 point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked up compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially, but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada.
Globally, the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remained challenging, with oil and gas and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow.
Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline.
In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally, but particularly in heavy industry end markets, affecting our solutions and services businesses.
In China, conditions remained stable, and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down midteens in the quarter. I am encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year.
EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I'm particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region.
In Latin America, sales were up 8%, led by Mexico, where strength remains broad based across most verticals.
Let me add a few comments about the quarter. Our process business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year, but grew 4% sequentially. And I am pleased that, as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%.
Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks.
Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect continued improvement in our products sales. But the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April.
Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals.
Taking all these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, 1 point lower than our April guidance, and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6.
Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year.
But here are some initial points. Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers best opportunities for productivity, combining our differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience.
Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customer share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality.  Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above-market growth will come from share gains, new value from the connected enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy.
We are very well positioned to bring the connected enterprise to life for our customers given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value. And I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements.
Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out, and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continued to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers everyday as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers.
With that, Ted?"

I'll start on Page 4, third quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,474,000,000, 6.4% lower than Q3 last year.

Sales in the quarter were $1,474,000,000, 6.4% lower than Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 4.8%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.8%. As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations.
Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points.
General corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized the favorable discrete tax item in the current quarter, and we're also benefiting this year from the R&D tax credit.
Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%.
A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million.
In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We are running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1,075,000,000 remaining under the previous share repurchase authorizations.
The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results.
On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points.
Turning to Page 6. This is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year on a reported basis with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%.
On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in this segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. The decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected, and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada.
The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly in the U.S., we saw larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and we expect this trend in delays to continue into Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter.
CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation cost.
Moving to the next slide. Page 7 provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the 9 months through June. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional color, so I'll just add a couple of notes. We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total emerging market organic sales with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%.
Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year '16 guidance. So as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and the order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the related reduced outlook for Q4, we are reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%.
You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year, but still at about minus 3%.
We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced top line.
We now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about 0.5 point lower than previous guidance and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier.
Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts, but basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales, we mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate. We continue to expect about 100% conversion of adjusted income to free cash flow.
There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A."

So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They're using our new products, some of our recent CompactLogix releases, motion, PowerFlex drives to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks. And we can remotely monitor that line and 100 other lines around the world to benchmark performance and maximize uptime. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plant floor drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value. So they are starting to -- they're starting small so that they can have a discrete opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out and each customers going to move at their own pace, so we're very encouraged by the early progress."

As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month, while Keith remains Chairman of our board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity.
As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith's generated exceptional financial returns for share owners during his tenure.
On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way by focusing on long-term customer value and rock solid integrity.
So certainly, big shoes to fill, but I am very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners, we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above market revenue growth and superior financial returns.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about 1 point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked up compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially, but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada.
Globally, the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remained challenging, with oil and gas and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow.
Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline.
In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally, but particularly in heavy industry end markets, affecting our solutions and services businesses.
In China, conditions remained stable, and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down midteens in the quarter. I am encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year.
EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I'm particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region.
In Latin America, sales were up 8%, led by Mexico, where strength remains broad based across most verticals.
Let me add a few comments about the quarter. Our process business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year, but grew 4% sequentially. And I am pleased that, as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%.
Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks.
Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect continued improvement in our products sales. But the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April.
Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals.
Taking all these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, 1 point lower than our April guidance, and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6.
Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year.
But here are some initial points. Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers' best opportunities for productivity, combining our differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience.
Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customer share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality.  Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above-market growth will come from share gains, new value from the connected enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy.
We are very well positioned to bring the connected enterprise to life for our customers given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value. And I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements.
Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out, and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continued to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers everyday as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers.
With that, Ted?"

As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations.
Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points.
General corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized the favorable discrete tax item in the current quarter, and we're also benefiting this year from the R&D tax credit.
Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%.
A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million.
In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We are running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1,075,000,000 remaining under the previous share repurchase authorizations.
The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results.
On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points.
Turning to Page 6. This is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year on a reported basis with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%.
On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in this segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. The decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected, and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada.
The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly in the U.S., we saw larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and we expect this trend in delays to continue into Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter.
CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation cost.
Moving to the next slide. Page 7 provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the 9 months through June. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional color, so I'll just add a couple of notes. We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total emerging market organic sales with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%.
Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year '16 guidance. So as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and the order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the related reduced outlook for Q4, we are reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%.
You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year, but still at about minus 3%.
We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced top line.
We now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about 0.5 point lower than previous guidance and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier.
Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts, but basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales, we mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate. We continue to expect about 100% conversion of adjusted income to free cash flow.
There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A."

It was really the solutions and services businesses where we saw the unexpected decline, and it appears to be very much related to heavy industry.

So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They're using our new products, some of our recent CompactLogix releases, motion, PowerFlex drives to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks. And we can remotely monitor that line and 100 other lines around the world to benchmark performance and maximize uptime. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plant floor drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value. So they are starting to -- they're starting small so that they can have a discrete opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out and each customers going to move at their own pace, so we're very encouraged by the early progress."

And 2, if we don't need to adjust the cost structure, do we need to do some reallocation of resources so that we can get positioned for where we think the best growth opportunities will be next year.

As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month, while Keith remains Chairman of our board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity.
As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith's generated exceptional financial returns for share owners during his tenure.
On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way by focusing on long-term customer value and rock solid integrity.
So certainly, big shoes to fill, but I am very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners, we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above market revenue growth and superior financial returns.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about 1 point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked up compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially, but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada.
Globally, the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remained challenging, with oil and gas and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow.
Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline.
In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally, but particularly in heavy industry end markets, affecting our solutions and services businesses.
In China, conditions remained stable, and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down midteens in the quarter. I am encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year.
EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I'm particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region.
In Latin America, sales were up 8%, led by Mexico, where strength remains broad based across most verticals.
Let me add a few comments about the quarter. Our process business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year, but grew 4% sequentially. And I am pleased that, as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%.
Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks.
Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect continued improvement in our products sales. But the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April.
Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals.
Taking all these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, 1 point lower than our April guidance, and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6.
Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year.
But here are some initial points. Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers' best opportunities for productivity, combining our differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience.
Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customer share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality.  Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above-market growth will come from share gains, new value from the connected enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy.
We are very well positioned to bring the connected enterprise to life for our customers given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value. And I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements.
Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out, and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continued to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers everyday as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers.
With that, Ted?"

As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations.
Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points.
General corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized the favorable discrete tax item in the current quarter, and we're also benefiting this year from the R&D tax credit.
Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%.
A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million.
In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We are running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1,075,000,000 remaining under the previous share repurchase authorizations.
The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results.
On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points.
Turning to Page 6. This is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year on a reported basis with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%.
On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in this segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. The decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected, and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada.
The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly in the U.S., we saw larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and we expect this trend in delays to continue into Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter.
CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation cost.
Moving to the next slide. Page 7 provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the 9 months through June. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional color, so I'll just add a couple of notes. We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total emerging market organic sales with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%.
Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year '16 guidance. So as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and the order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the related reduced outlook for Q4, we are reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%.
You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year, but still at about minus 3%.
We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced top line.
We now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about 0.5 point lower than previous guidance and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier.
Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts, but basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales, we mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate. We continue to expect about 100% conversion of adjusted income to free cash flow.
There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A."

The first thing I would say is from a quarterly progression point of view, this was a pretty typical quarter where we actually saw improvement as the quarter progressed. In terms of overall U.S. market conditions, it's a little bit mixed right now. I mean, our products sales in the U.S. were up sequentially, pretty much exactly as we expected. And I'd say we're seeing a positive demand trend on the product side. It was really the solutions and services businesses where we saw the unexpected decline, and it appears to be very much related to heavy industry. As you know, we've got more exposure in solutions and services to heavy industry and a better exposure in product sales to consumer and automotive.

So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They're using our new products, some of our recent CompactLogix releases, motion, PowerFlex drives to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks. And we can remotely monitor that line and 100 other lines around the world to benchmark performance and maximize uptime. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plant floor drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value. So they are starting to -- they're starting small so that they can have a discrete opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out and each customers going to move at their own pace, so we're very encouraged by the early progress."

And 2, if we don't need to adjust the cost structure, do we need to do some reallocation of resources so that we can get positioned for where we think the best growth opportunities will be next year.

As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month, while Keith remains Chairman of our board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity.
As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith's generated exceptional financial returns for share owners during his tenure.
On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way by focusing on long-term customer value and rock solid integrity.
So certainly, big shoes to fill, but I am very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners, we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above market revenue growth and superior financial returns.
With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about 1 point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked up compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially, but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada.
Globally, the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remained challenging, with oil and gas and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow.
Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline.
In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally, but particularly in heavy industry end markets, affecting our solutions and services businesses.
In China, conditions remained stable, and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down midteens in the quarter. I am encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year.
EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I'm particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region.
In Latin America, sales were up 8%, led by Mexico, where strength remains broad based across most verticals.
Let me add a few comments about the quarter. Our process business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year, but grew 4% sequentially. And I am pleased that, as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%.
Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks.
Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect continued improvement in our products sales. But the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April.
Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals.
Taking all these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, 1 point lower than our April guidance, and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6.
Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year.
But here are some initial points. Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers' best opportunities for productivity, combining our differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience.
Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customer share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality.  Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above-market growth will come from share gains, new value from the connected enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy.
We are very well positioned to bring the connected enterprise to life for our customers given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value. And I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements.
Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out, and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continued to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers everyday as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive.
Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers.
With that, Ted?"

Sales in the quarter were $1,474,000,000, 6.4% lower than Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 4.8%, and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.8%. As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations.
Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points.
General corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to the third quarter of last year.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized the favorable discrete tax item in the current quarter, and we're also benefiting this year from the R&D tax credit.
Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%.
A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million.
In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We are running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1,075,000,000 remaining under the previous share repurchase authorizations.
The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results.
On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%.
Moving to the right side of the chart. A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points.
Turning to Page 6. This is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year on a reported basis with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%.
On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in this segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. The decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected, and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada.
The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly in the U.S., we saw larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and we expect this trend in delays to continue into Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter.
CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation cost.
Moving to the next slide. Page 7 provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the 9 months through June. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional color, so I'll just add a couple of notes. We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total emerging market organic sales with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%.
Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year '16 guidance. So as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and the order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the related reduced outlook for Q4, we are reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%.
You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year, but still at about minus 3%.
We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced top line.
We now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about 0.5 point lower than previous guidance and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier.
Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts, but basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales, we mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate. We continue to expect about 100% conversion of adjusted income to free cash flow.
There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A."

The first thing I would say is from a quarterly progression point of view, this was a pretty typical quarter where we actually saw improvement as the quarter progressed. In terms of overall U.S. market conditions, it's a little bit mixed right now. I mean, our products sales in the U.S. were up sequentially, pretty much exactly as we expected. And I'd say we're seeing a positive demand trend on the product side. It was really the solutions and services businesses where we saw the unexpected decline, and it appears to be very much related to heavy industry. As you know, we've got more exposure in solutions and services to heavy industry and a better exposure in product sales to consumer and automotive. And I think it's that dichotomy in the performance of those respective verticals that's causing that result."

And so the functionality that I talked about for a machine builder, those same products include the functionality that enables that higher-level productivity. So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They're using our new products, some of our recent CompactLogix releases, motion, PowerFlex drives to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks. And we can remotely monitor that line and 100 other lines around the world to benchmark performance and maximize uptime. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plant floor drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value so they are starting to -- they're starting small so that they can have a discrete opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out and each customers going to move at their own pace, so we're very encouraged by the early progress."

But given the slowdown that we saw in the solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the revised outlook for Q4, we're now kind of taking that into account as well as assessing what we think we're going to see at least in the first half of next year, and we're going through a careful assessment of, one, do we need to adjust the cost structure? And 2, if we don't need to adjust the cost structure, do we need to do some reallocation of resources so that we can get positioned for where we think the best growth opportunities will be next year. That's a combination of both of those things that have caused us to put some potential restructuring charges into Q4."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our pro",1011,"Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our product businesses continued to improve sequentially, and the Architecture & Software segment returned to year-over-year organic growth. Orders and sales of our solutions and services businesses, while still down year-over-year, came in as expected. Globally, oil and gas and mining remained the weakest verticals, with oil and gas down about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, it appears these markets are stabilizing. 
Consumer and automotive both had good growth in the quarter. For automotive, this was the best year-over-year growth quarter of the year. Our powertrain initiative is yielding results and is contributing toward growth and share gains in this vertical. 
From a regional perspective, in the U.S., our product businesses continued to improve sequentially and were up year-over-year for the first time this year. Food and beverage and automotive were our strongest verticals in the U.S. EMEA was down year-over-year in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected, but order growth was strong and up mid-single digits year-over-year. Our performance in Asia was stronger than we expected, with growth in most countries in the region, including China, where we saw modest year-over-year growth for the first time this year. And as expected, our organic growth rate in Latin America slowed down. Continued growth in Mexico was offset by weakness elsewhere in the region, including Brazil. 
A couple of additional comments about the quarter. Our process business was down 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued weakness in heavy industries. Logix was down 1% compared to last year, but grew again sequentially, and I'm pleased with about 20% segment margin in the quarter despite higher restructuring charges. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks. 
Moving to the full year. Fiscal 2016 was a challenging year, but I believe we executed well in difficult market conditions. Here are some key points. Throughout fiscal 2016, we've talked about significant declines in heavy industry verticals. Oil and gas was down about 25% for the year; mining, mid-teens. Weak heavy industry performance impacted process and Logix performance, which were down 15% and 4% for the year, respectively. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits. This reflects our continued success with machine builders. After several strong years, automotive continued to grow, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative, and we saw double-digit growth in revenue streams related to new value from the connected enterprise. We'll talk more about that on Thursday at our Investor Day. 
With respect to financial performance, we were able to keep our segment margin above 20% despite 7% lower reported sales. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion, over 100% of adjusted income, and we continued to return cash to share owners, almost $900 million during fiscal 2016. Just last week, we announced a 5% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle. 
To accelerate the execution of our strategy, we acquired 3 great companies during fiscal 2016. These acquisitions further strengthen our technology differentiation, increase our domain expertise and expand market access. MagneMotion adds to our portfolio of innovative motion control solutions for consumer and transportation verticals. Automation Control Products adds new value to our software offering and applications across all industries, and MAVERICK Technologies adds expertise in chemical, consumer, life sciences and oil and gas industry applications. I believe these acquisitions will help us grow market share. 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment. 
Let's move on now to the fiscal 2017 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Since these significant declines in early 2016, oil and commodity prices have somewhat recovered, and our business in heavy industry markets generally appears to have stabilized. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of global capital expenditures. We therefore expect improvement to continue into fiscal 2017 with continued growth in the consumer and auto verticals and with heavy industries about flat year-over-year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 2% year-over-year. In addition, we project the acquisitions we made in 2016 to contribute significant growth. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2017 sales guidance of a little more than $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.25. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you later this week at our Annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day in Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Atlanta this year. Coincidentally, Atlanta is my hometown. We again expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world for this year's Automation Fair. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions and information solutions and highlight how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners bring the connected enterprise to life. 
Regardless of the macro environment, the secular tailwinds for automation remain intact, and the opportunities provided by the connected enterprise are real. I believe we are best positioned to deliver the connected enterprise to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base. We have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. And the value we provide is in high demand as every day, customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We will continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share. 
More on Thursday during Investor Day. And with that, Ted?"

I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency trans",2135,"Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points, and acquisitions increased sales by 40 basis points. Both the organic result and the currency impact were a little better than we expected. 
Segment operating margin was 19.8%, down 1.1 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year-over-year was primarily due to lower organic sales and higher restructuring charges partly offset by favorable mix. Restructuring charges in the quarter totaled about $20 million, higher than the $10 million that we talked about in our last earnings call. We elected to go deeper with restructuring to help offset known earnings headwinds in fiscal year '17 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to areas where we believe we have the best growth opportunities in the coming year. We expect these actions to generate gross savings of over $30 million in fiscal '17 and over $40 million on a full run rate basis. 
General corporate net expense was $25 million in Q4 compared to $20 million a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter last year. In Q4 this year, the adjusted effective tax rate was lower than last year, but also better than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable mix of income across our global operations. Compared to Q4 last year, we also benefited this year from the R&D tax credit. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $1.57 in Q4 last year. The effect on adjusted EPS of lower operating earnings was partly offset by a lower tax rate and lower share count. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 is a few cents above the implied fourth quarter guidance, including the lower tax rate, but despite the higher restructuring charges. Free cash flow for Q4 was $235 million. That's another very good quarter. The rolling 4-quarter return on invested capital was 33%. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130 million. That's down 3% from Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $130 million. 
Turning to Page 5. This is the full year version of the key financial information. Sales were $5,880,000,000 for the full year, down 6.8%. Organic sales declined 3.9%. Currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.2%, down 1.4 points from last year. The primary factors were lower organic sales and the negative impact from currency effects, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Adjusted EPS was $5.93, down 7% compared to last year on a 7% reported sales decline. 
General corporate net expense was $80 million for the full year. That was about $5 million more than we talked about last quarter. Free cash flow for the full year was $834 million, which was 107% of adjusted income, a little better than our targeted conversion and previous guidance. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares at a cost of $500 million. That's right around the $500 million target that we shared last November. 
The next 2 slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on Page 6. I'll start with the quarter performance. On the left side of this chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q4, up 1.8% from the same quarter last year. Organic sales increased 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 1%, and currency translation reduced sales by 60 basis points. As Blake mentioned, this is the first quarter for year-over-year organic growth in the Architecture & Software segment in over a year. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. Architecture & Software margins in the quarter were 25.8%, down 1.5 points from Q4 last year and primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher restructuring charges. For the full year, A&S sales were down 4.2% as reported, with a 1.5% organic sales decline, a 30 basis point contribution from acquisitions and currency translation reducing sales by 3%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 26.4%, down 3 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower sales, unfavorable mix and unfavorable currency effects. 
Now on Page 7, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $842 million, down 8.8% year-over-year with an organic sales decline of 8%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 80 basis points. The organic sales in the product businesses in this segment grew by about 1%. Solutions and services business sales declined by about 14%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for solutions and services was 0.92. That's better than the typical Q4 result, but on a relatively weak billings denominator. 
Operating margin was 14.8%, down 1.4 points compared to last year, primarily due to the significant organic sales decline, partly offset by productivity. For the full year, CP&S sales were down 8.8% year-over-year and down 5.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3%. On an organic basis for the full year, product sales in the segment were down about 2%, and solutions and services sales declined by about 8%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.2%, 30 basis points below 2015. This was a very good result despite an almost 9% drop in reported sales and largely attributable to strong productivity performance in the year. 
Page 8 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rates. Starting with the quarter, the U.S. was down about 7%, Canada down about 10%. In the U.S., our product businesses grew year-over-year in Q4 for the first time in fiscal '16. EMEA was down 3%. But as Blake noted, underlying orders were good, and it was a relatively difficult year-over-year comparison. We saw about 5% growth in Asia Pacific, with China growth a little below that, and with India in the high single digits. This is the first quarter for organic growth in Asia Pacific and in China in more than a year. Latin America was up about 1%. Mexico was up almost 10%, but that was largely offset by declines in Brazil and the balance of the region. 
Moving to the full year. I'll try to provide some vertical color on the full year results. In the U.S. and Canada, sales declined 7%. Across all regions this year, we experienced significant weakness in heavy industries, and that was particularly true in the U.S. For the company in total, oil and gas was down about 25% for the full year, but our largest decline in oil and gas occurred in the U.S., considerably worse than the company average. Similarly, mining, which was down mid-teens year-over-year for the company, was down over 20% in the U.S. The best-growing verticals in the U.S. were food and beverage and life sciences. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 2% year-over-year with 1% growth in the mature markets and almost 4% growth in the emerging markets. On a vertical basis, oil and gas was down about 10%, mining was down mid-single digit, and we saw particularly strong growth in life sciences and home and personal care. 
In Asia Pacific, we finished the year with sales down 5%. India saw a double-digit growth, and China was down a little less than 10%. In Asia Pacific, heavy industry verticals were down across the board, except for water/wastewater. Automotive, food and beverage and life sciences were the best performing. Food and beverage was up about 20% year-over-year, primarily due to China. 
In Latin America, sales increased 7% for the full year, with Mexico over 20% and Brazil down almost 10%. Oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was about flat. We saw growth in most other verticals, with strong growth in auto and home and personal care. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 1%, with growth in Latin America and EMEA emerging markets and declines in China. 
And that takes us to the fiscal '17 guidance slide. On the revenue side, here's how we're thinking about fiscal year '17. We've seen solid sequential growth in our product businesses over the last 2 quarters of fiscal year '16. Orders in our solutions and services businesses seem to be reaching a bottom. From a vertical perspective, it appears that oil and gas and mining are stabilizing. We don't expect things to get better in fiscal year '17, but we don't expect the drag in these industries that we experienced in 2016 to continue. We expect our business in auto and consumer industries to continue to grow. We've always said that our business tracks best with levels of industrial production. Current forecasts of industrial production for fiscal year '17 indicate growth of a little over 1%. That compares to a 20 basis point decline in industrial production in 2016. Generally, we expect to grow at a [indiscernible] growth. 
Blake mentioned that during 2016, we saw double-digit growth in some revenue streams related to the connected enterprise. We expect these revenue streams to continue to grow faster than the company average in fiscal 2017. With other share gain opportunities like powertrain and OEM, this will help us to continue to generate above-market organic growth. Taking all of that into account, we expect organic growth in fiscal '17 of about 2%. We expect acquisitions to add about 1.5 points of additional growth. We expect a minor headwind from currency, about a 50 basis point reduction to sales for the full year. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming a euro rate of $1.09. 
We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be a little over $6 billion. Our guidance range for organic growth is 0 to 4%. We expect to see growth in all regions, except Canada. We expect Canada to be up -- to be about flat year-over-year in '17. We expect slightly higher growth in the product businesses than in our solutions and services businesses. And given the beginning backlog in our solutions and services businesses, for the company in total, we expect to see a lower rate of growth in the first half of the year and a higher growth in the second half. 
We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%, maybe a little bit lower. That's not our normal conversion, but we know we have margin headwinds to deal with in 2017, namely the restoration of incentive compensation, an increase in operating pension expense and unfavorable currency impact that's catching up to us from the rolling of currency hedges we had in place last year. 
We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24%. That's a little higher than in 2016. The rate reflects recognition of an expected discrete benefit in the first quarter, so the rate will be lower in Q1 and higher over the balance of the year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.85 to $6.25. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And a couple of items not shown here: General corporate net expense should be approximately $75 million in 2017. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 128 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Blake already talked about last week's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2017 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases in 2017. 
The final page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '17. I think what's most relevant on this chart is that you can see graphically the fiscal '17 earning headwinds we've been talking about over the past few quarters. The restoration of incentive compensation is about a $0.25 headwind, with pension, currency and tax rate all at about $0.05. Altogether, about $0.40 of headwinds. Based on our previous and ongoing share repurchases, we expect a tailwind of about $0.15 from share count, along with the core contribution. That's the walk to the $6.05 at the midpoint for fiscal 2017. We expect the effect of the recent acquisitions to be about neutral to adjusted EPS, including acquisition-related costs. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick, and we'll begin Q&A."

There's no better way for us to spur our growth in performance and growth in our core platforms. That being said, the pace of the technology and the demands of customers that they have on their automation and information partners with credibility and understanding of their best opportunities for productivity do put a little additional emphasis on acquiring and partnering for new technology and domain expertise. So it's more about the accelerated pace of the technology that may spur a little bit more activity on the acquisition side. But again, our priorities remain, first, organic growth. And then in terms of capital, acquisitions followed by dividend and share repurchase. So I don't want to signal -- I'm not signaling an interest in going after something big. We're not constrained. But our first priorities when we do consider acquisitions are: ""How do they accelerate our existing strategy? How do they bring us technology innovation? How do they increase our domain expertise? How do they increase our market access?"" And so the best acquisitions address one or more of those areas, and then we look secondarily about their impact on some portion of our financial structure."

So we can't depend entirely on our distributors to make that market for us. So we're investing in people who have skills in that area and have the expertise and the applications and the technology for driving that additional productivity. And we're looking at partners as well. Engineering companies, when they see the value of working with us, they can be a very credible source of information and value-add for those customers as well. So it's a broad approach. It remains one that includes distribution at its core, but it also includes developing our own capabilities as well as developing deeper relationships with key engineering firms."

I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our product businesses continued to improve sequentially, and the Architecture & Software segment returned to year-over-year organic growth. Orders and sales of our solutions and services businesses, while still down year-over-year, came in as expected. Globally, oil and gas and mining remained the weakest verticals, with oil and gas down about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, it appears these markets are stabilizing. 
Consumer and automotive both had good growth in the quarter. For automotive, this was the best year-over-year growth quarter of the year. Our powertrain initiative is yielding results and is contributing toward growth and share gains in this vertical. 
From a regional perspective, in the U.S., our product businesses continued to improve sequentially and were up year-over-year for the first time this year. Food and beverage and automotive were our strongest verticals in the U.S. EMEA was down year-over-year in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected, but order growth was strong and up mid-single digits year-over-year. Our performance in Asia was stronger than we expected, with growth in most countries in the region, including China, where we saw modest year-over-year growth for the first time this year. And as expected, our organic growth rate in Latin America slowed down. Continued growth in Mexico was offset by weakness elsewhere in the region, including Brazil. 
A couple of additional comments about the quarter. Our process business was down 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued weakness in heavy industries. Logix was down 1% compared to last year, but grew again sequentially, and I'm pleased with about 20% segment margin in the quarter despite higher restructuring charges. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks. 
Moving to the full year. Fiscal 2016 was a challenging year, but I believe we executed well in difficult market conditions. Here are some key points. Throughout fiscal 2016, we've talked about significant declines in heavy industry verticals. Oil and gas was down about 25% for the year; mining, mid-teens. Weak heavy industry performance impacted process and Logix performance, which were down 15% and 4% for the year, respectively. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits. This reflects our continued success with machine builders. After several strong years, automotive continued to grow, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative, and we saw double-digit growth in revenue streams related to new value from the connected enterprise. We'll talk more about that on Thursday at our Investor Day. 
With respect to financial performance, we were able to keep our segment margin above 20% despite 7% lower reported sales. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion, over 100% of adjusted income, and we continued to return cash to share owners, almost $900 million during fiscal 2016. Just last week, we announced a 5% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle. 
To accelerate the execution of our strategy, we acquired 3 great companies during fiscal 2016. These acquisitions further strengthen our technology differentiation, increase our domain expertise and expand market access. MagneMotion adds to our portfolio of innovative motion control solutions for consumer and transportation verticals. Automation Control Products adds new value to our software offering and applications across all industries, and MAVERICK Technologies adds expertise in chemical, consumer, life sciences and oil and gas industry applications. I believe these acquisitions will help us grow market share. 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment. 
Let's move on now to the fiscal 2017 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Since these significant declines in early 2016, oil and commodity prices have somewhat recovered, and our business in heavy industry markets generally appears to have stabilized. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of global capital expenditures. We therefore expect improvement to continue into fiscal 2017 with continued growth in the consumer and auto verticals and with heavy industries about flat year-over-year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 2% year-over-year. In addition, we project the acquisitions we made in 2016 to contribute significant growth. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2017 sales guidance of a little more than $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.25. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you later this week at our Annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day in Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Atlanta this year. Coincidentally, Atlanta is my hometown. We again expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world for this year's Automation Fair. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions and information solutions and highlight how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners bring the connected enterprise to life. 
Regardless of the macro environment, the secular tailwinds for automation remain intact, and the opportunities provided by the connected enterprise are real. I believe we are best positioned to deliver the connected enterprise to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base. We have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. And the value we provide is in high demand as every day, customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We will continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share. 
More on Thursday during Investor Day. And with that, Ted?"
300504,406689588,1077962,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency trans",2135,"Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points, and acquisitions increased sales by 40 basis points. Both the organic result and the currency impact were a little better than we expected. 
Segment operating margin was 19.8%, down 1.1 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year-over-year was primarily due to lower organic sales and higher restructuring charges partly offset by favorable mix. Restructuring charges in the quarter totaled about $20 million, higher than the $10 million that we talked about in our last earnings call. We elected to go deeper with restructuring to help offset known earnings headwinds in fiscal year '17 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to areas where we believe we have the best growth opportunities in the coming year. We expect these actions to generate gross savings of over $30 million in fiscal '17 and over $40 million on a full run rate basis. 
General corporate net expense was $25 million in Q4 compared to $20 million a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter last year. In Q4 this year, the adjusted effective tax rate was lower than last year, but also better than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable mix of income across our global operations. Compared to Q4 last year, we also benefited this year from the R&D tax credit. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $1.57 in Q4 last year. The effect on adjusted EPS of lower operating earnings was partly offset by a lower tax rate and lower share count. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 is a few cents above the implied fourth quarter guidance, including the lower tax rate, but despite the higher restructuring charges. Free cash flow for Q4 was $235 million. That's another very good quarter. The rolling 4-quarter return on invested capital was 33%. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130 million. That's down 3% from Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $130 million. 
Turning to Page 5. This is the full year version of the key financial information. Sales were $5,880,000,000 for the full year, down 6.8%. Organic sales declined 3.9%. Currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.2%, down 1.4 points from last year. The primary factors were lower organic sales and the negative impact from currency effects, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Adjusted EPS was $5.93, down 7% compared to last year on a 7% reported sales decline. 
General corporate net expense was $80 million for the full year. That was about $5 million more than we talked about last quarter. Free cash flow for the full year was $834 million, which was 107% of adjusted income, a little better than our targeted conversion and previous guidance. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares at a cost of $500 million. That's right around the $500 million target that we shared last November. 
The next 2 slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on Page 6. I'll start with the quarter performance. On the left side of this chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q4, up 1.8% from the same quarter last year. Organic sales increased 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 1%, and currency translation reduced sales by 60 basis points. As Blake mentioned, this is the first quarter for year-over-year organic growth in the Architecture & Software segment in over a year. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. Architecture & Software margins in the quarter were 25.8%, down 1.5 points from Q4 last year and primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher restructuring charges. For the full year, A&S sales were down 4.2% as reported, with a 1.5% organic sales decline, a 30 basis point contribution from acquisitions and currency translation reducing sales by 3%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 26.4%, down 3 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower sales, unfavorable mix and unfavorable currency effects. 
Now on Page 7, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $842 million, down 8.8% year-over-year with an organic sales decline of 8%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 80 basis points. The organic sales in the product businesses in this segment grew by about 1%. Solutions and services business sales declined by about 14%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for solutions and services was 0.92. That's better than the typical Q4 result, but on a relatively weak billings denominator. 
Operating margin was 14.8%, down 1.4 points compared to last year, primarily due to the significant organic sales decline, partly offset by productivity. For the full year, CP&S sales were down 8.8% year-over-year and down 5.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3%. On an organic basis for the full year, product sales in the segment were down about 2%, and solutions and services sales declined by about 8%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.2%, 30 basis points below 2015. This was a very good result despite an almost 9% drop in reported sales and largely attributable to strong productivity performance in the year. 
Page 8 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rates. Starting with the quarter, the U.S. was down about 7%, Canada down about 10%. In the U.S., our product businesses grew year-over-year in Q4 for the first time in fiscal '16. EMEA was down 3%. But as Blake noted, underlying orders were good, and it was a relatively difficult year-over-year comparison. We saw about 5% growth in Asia Pacific, with China growth a little below that, and with India in the high single digits. This is the first quarter for organic growth in Asia Pacific and in China in more than a year. Latin America was up about 1%. Mexico was up almost 10%, but that was largely offset by declines in Brazil and the balance of the region. 
Moving to the full year. I'll try to provide some vertical color on the full year results. In the U.S. and Canada, sales declined 7%. Across all regions this year, we experienced significant weakness in heavy industries, and that was particularly true in the U.S. For the company in total, oil and gas was down about 25% for the full year, but our largest decline in oil and gas occurred in the U.S., considerably worse than the company average. Similarly, mining, which was down mid-teens year-over-year for the company, was down over 20% in the U.S. The best-growing verticals in the U.S. were food and beverage and life sciences. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 2% year-over-year with 1% growth in the mature markets and almost 4% growth in the emerging markets. On a vertical basis, oil and gas was down about 10%, mining was down mid-single digit, and we saw particularly strong growth in life sciences and home and personal care. 
In Asia Pacific, we finished the year with sales down 5%. India saw a double-digit growth, and China was down a little less than 10%. In Asia Pacific, heavy industry verticals were down across the board, except for water/wastewater. Automotive, food and beverage and life sciences were the best performing. Food and beverage was up about 20% year-over-year, primarily due to China. 
In Latin America, sales increased 7% for the full year, with Mexico over 20% and Brazil down almost 10%. Oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was about flat. We saw growth in most other verticals, with strong growth in auto and home and personal care. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 1%, with growth in Latin America and EMEA emerging markets and declines in China. 
And that takes us to the fiscal '17 guidance slide. On the revenue side, here's how we're thinking about fiscal year '17. We've seen solid sequential growth in our product businesses over the last 2 quarters of fiscal year '16. Orders in our solutions and services businesses seem to be reaching a bottom. From a vertical perspective, it appears that oil and gas and mining are stabilizing. We don't expect things to get better in fiscal year '17, but we don't expect the drag in these industries that we experienced in 2016 to continue. We expect our business in auto and consumer industries to continue to grow. We've always said that our business tracks best with levels of industrial production. Current forecasts of industrial production for fiscal year '17 indicate growth of a little over 1%. That compares to a 20 basis point decline in industrial production in 2016. Generally, we expect to grow at a [indiscernible] growth. 
Blake mentioned that during 2016, we saw double-digit growth in some revenue streams related to the connected enterprise. We expect these revenue streams to continue to grow faster than the company average in fiscal 2017. With other share gain opportunities like powertrain and OEM, this will help us to continue to generate above-market organic growth. Taking all of that into account, we expect organic growth in fiscal '17 of about 2%. We expect acquisitions to add about 1.5 points of additional growth. We expect a minor headwind from currency, about a 50 basis point reduction to sales for the full year. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming a euro rate of $1.09. 
We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be a little over $6 billion. Our guidance range for organic growth is 0 to 4%. We expect to see growth in all regions, except Canada. We expect Canada to be up -- to be about flat year-over-year in '17. We expect slightly higher growth in the product businesses than in our solutions and services businesses. And given the beginning backlog in our solutions and services businesses, for the company in total, we expect to see a lower rate of growth in the first half of the year and a higher growth in the second half. 
We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%, maybe a little bit lower. That's not our normal conversion, but we know we have margin headwinds to deal with in 2017, namely the restoration of incentive compensation, an increase in operating pension expense and unfavorable currency impact that's catching up to us from the rolling of currency hedges we had in place last year. 
We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24%. That's a little higher than in 2016. The rate reflects recognition of an expected discrete benefit in the first quarter, so the rate will be lower in Q1 and higher over the balance of the year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.85 to $6.25. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And a couple of items not shown here: General corporate net expense should be approximately $75 million in 2017. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 128 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Blake already talked about last week's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2017 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases in 2017. 
The final page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '17. I think what's most relevant on this chart is that you can see graphically the fiscal '17 earning headwinds we've been talking about over the past few quarters. The restoration of incentive compensation is about a $0.25 headwind, with pension, currency and tax rate all at about $0.05. Altogether, about $0.40 of headwinds. Based on our previous and ongoing share repurchases, we expect a tailwind of about $0.15 from share count, along with the core contribution. That's the walk to the $6.05 at the midpoint for fiscal 2017. We expect the effect of the recent acquisitions to be about neutral to adjusted EPS, including acquisition-related costs. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick, and we'll begin Q&A."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our pro",1010,"Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our product businesses continued to improve sequentially, and the Architecture & Software segment returned to year-over-year organic growth. Orders and sales of our solutions and services businesses, while still down year-over-year, came in as expected. Globally, oil and gas and mining remained the weakest verticals, with oil and gas down about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, it appears these markets are stabilizing. 
Consumer and automotive both had good growth in the quarter. For automotive, this was the best year-over-year growth quarter of the year. Our powertrain initiative is yielding results and is contributing toward growth and share gains in this vertical. 
From a regional perspective, in the U.S., our product businesses continued to improve sequentially and were up year-over-year for the first time this year. Food and beverage and automotive were our strongest verticals in the U.S. EMEA was down year-over-year in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected, but order growth was strong and up mid-single digits year-over-year. Our performance in Asia was stronger than we expected, with growth in most countries in the region, including China, where we saw modest year-over-year growth for the first time this year. And as expected, our organic growth rate in Latin America slowed down. Continued growth in Mexico was offset by weakness elsewhere in the region, including Brazil. 
A couple of additional comments about the quarter. Our process business was down 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued weakness in heavy industries. Logix was down 1% compared to last year, but grew again sequentially, and I'm pleased with about 20% segment margin in the quarter despite higher restructuring charges. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks. 
Moving to the full year. Fiscal 2016 was a challenging year, but I believe we executed well in difficult market conditions. Here are some key points. Throughout fiscal 2016, we've talked about significant declines in heavy industry verticals. Oil and gas was down about 25% for the year; mining, mid-teens. Weak heavy industry performance impacted process and Logix performance, which were down 15% and 4% for the year, respectively. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits. This reflects our continued success with machine builders. After several strong years, automotive continued to grow, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative, and we saw double-digit growth in revenue streams related to new value from the connected enterprise. We'll talk more about that on Thursday at our Investor Day. 
With respect to financial performance, we were able to keep our segment margin above 20% despite 7% lower reported sales. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion, over 100% of adjusted income, and we continued to return cash to shareowners, almost $900 million during fiscal 2016. Just last week, we announced a 5% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle. 
To accelerate the execution of our strategy, we acquired 3 great companies during fiscal 2016. These acquisitions further strengthen our technology differentiation, increase our domain expertise and expand market access. MagneMotion adds to our portfolio of innovative motion control solutions for consumer and transportation verticals. Automation Control Products adds new value to our software offering and applications across all industries, and MAVERICK Technologies adds expertise in chemical, consumer, life sciences and oil and gas industry applications. I believe these acquisitions will help us grow market share. 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment. 
Let's move on now to the fiscal 2017 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Since the significant declines in early 2016, oil and commodity prices have somewhat recovered, and our business in heavy industry markets generally appears to have stabilized. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of global capital expenditures. We therefore expect improvement to continue into fiscal 2017 with continued growth in the consumer and auto verticals and with heavy industries about flat year-over-year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 2% year-over-year. In addition, we project the acquisitions we made in 2016 to contribute significant growth. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2017 sales guidance of a little more than $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.25. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you later this week at our Annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Atlanta this year. Coincidentally, Atlanta is my hometown. We again expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world for this year's Automation Fair. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions and information solutions and highlight how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners bring the connected enterprise to life. 
Regardless of the macro environment, the secular tailwinds for automation remain intact, and the opportunities provided by the connected enterprise are real. I believe we are best positioned to deliver the connected enterprise to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base. We have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. And the value we provide is in high demand as every day, customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We will continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share. 
More on Thursday during Investor Day. And with that, Ted?"
300504,406689588,1078258,"Rockwell Automation Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency trans",2135,"Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points, and acquisitions increased sales by 40 basis points. Both the organic result and the currency impact were a little better than we expected. 
Segment operating margin was 19.8%, down 1.1 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year-over-year was primarily due to lower organic sales and higher restructuring charges partly offset by favorable mix. Restructuring charges in the quarter totaled about $20 million, higher than the $10 million that we talked about in our last earnings call. We elected to go deeper with restructuring to help offset known earnings headwinds in fiscal year '17 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to areas where we believe we have the best growth opportunities in the coming year. We expect these actions to generate gross savings of over $30 million in fiscal '17 and over $40 million on a full run rate basis. 
General corporate net expense was $25 million in Q4 compared to $20 million a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter last year. In Q4 this year, the adjusted effective tax rate was lower than last year, but also better than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable mix of income across our global operations. Compared to Q4 last year, we also benefited this year from the R&D tax credit. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $1.57 in Q4 last year. The effect on adjusted EPS of lower operating earnings was partly offset by a lower tax rate and lower share count. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 is a few cents above the implied fourth quarter guidance, including the lower tax rate, but despite the higher restructuring charges. Free cash flow for Q4 was $235 million. That's another very good quarter. The rolling 4-quarter return on invested capital was 33%. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130 million. That's down 3% from Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $130 million. 
Turning to Page 5. This is the full year version of the key financial information. Sales were $5,880,000,000 for the full year, down 6.8%. Organic sales declined 3.9%. Currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.2%, down 1.4 points from last year. The primary factors were lower organic sales and the negative impact from currency effects, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Adjusted EPS was $5.93, down 7% compared to last year on a 7% reported sales decline. 
General corporate net expense was $80 million for the full year. That was about $5 million more than we talked about last quarter. Free cash flow for the full year was $834 million, which was 107% of adjusted income, a little better than our targeted conversion and previous guidance. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares at a cost of $500 million. That's right on the $500 million target that we shared last November. 
The next 2 slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on Page 6. I'll start with the quarter performance. On the left side of this chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q4, up 1.8% from the same quarter last year. Organic sales increased 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 1%, and currency translation reduced sales by 60 basis points. As Blake mentioned, this is the first quarter for year-over-year organic growth in the Architecture & Software segment in over a year. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. Architecture & Software margins in the quarter were 25.8%, down 1.5 points from Q4 last year and primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher restructuring charges. For the full year, A&S sales were down 4.2% as reported, with a 1.5% organic sales decline, a 30 basis point contribution from acquisitions and currency translation reducing sales by 3%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 26.4%, down 3 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower sales, unfavorable mix and unfavorable currency effects. 
Now on Page 7, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $842 million, down 8.8% year-over-year with an organic sales decline of 8%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 80 basis points. The organic sales in the product businesses in this segment grew by about 1%. Solutions and services business sales declined by about 14%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for solutions and services was 0.92. That's better than the typical Q4 result, but on a relatively-weak billings denominator. 
Operating margin was 14.8%, down 1.4 points compared to last year, primarily due to the significant organic sales decline, partly offset by productivity. For the full year, CP&S sales were down 8.8% year-over-year and down 5.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3%. On an organic basis for the full year, product sales in the segment were down about 2%, and solutions and services sales declined by about 8%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.2%, 30 basis points below 2015. This was a very good result despite an almost 9% drop in reported sales and largely attributable to strong productivity performance in the year. 
Page 8 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rate. Starting with the quarter, the U.S. was down about 7%, Canada down about 10%. In the U.S., our product businesses grew year-over-year in Q4 for the first time in fiscal '16. EMEA was down 3%. But as Blake noted, underlying orders were good, and it was a relatively-difficult year-over-year comparison. We saw about 5% growth in Asia Pacific, with China growth a little below that, and with India in the high single digits. This is the first quarter for organic growth in Asia Pacific and in China in more than a year. Latin America was up about 1%. Mexico was up almost 10%, but that was largely offset by declines in Brazil and the balance of the region. 
Moving to the full year. I'll try to provide some vertical color on the full year results. In the U.S. and Canada, sales declined 7%. Across all regions this year, we experienced significant weakness in heavy industries, and that was particularly true in the U.S. For the company in total, oil and gas was down about 25% for the full year, but our largest decline in oil and gas occurred in the U.S., considerably worse than the company average. Similarly, mining, which was down mid-teens year-over-year for the company, was down over 20% in the U.S. The best-growing verticals in the U.S. were food and beverage and life sciences. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 2% year-over-year with 1% growth in the mature markets and almost 4% growth in the emerging markets. On a vertical basis, oil and gas was down about 10%, mining was down mid-single digit, and we saw particularly strong growth in life sciences and home and personal care. 
In Asia Pacific, we finished the year with sales down 5%. India saw double-digit growth, and China was down a little less than 10%. In Asia Pacific, heavy industry verticals were down across the board, except for water/wastewater. Automotive, food and beverage and life sciences were the best performing. Food and beverage was up about 20% year-over-year, primarily due to China. 
In Latin America, sales increased 7% for the full year, with Mexico over 20% and Brazil down almost 10%. Oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was about flat. We saw growth in most other verticals, with strong growth in auto and home and personal care. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 1%, with growth in Latin America and EMEA emerging markets and declines in China. 
And that takes us to the fiscal '17 guidance slide. On the revenue side, here's how we're thinking about fiscal year '17. We've seen solid sequential growth in our product businesses over the last 2 quarters of fiscal year '16. Orders in our solutions and services businesses seem to be reaching a bottom. From a vertical perspective, it appears that oil and gas and mining are stabilizing. We don't expect things to get better in fiscal year '17, but we don't expect the drag in these industries that we experienced in 2016 to continue. We expect our business in auto and consumer industries to continue to grow. We've always said that our business tracks best with levels of industrial production. Current forecasts of industrial production for fiscal year '17 indicate growth of a little over 1%. That compares to a 20 basis point decline in industrial production in 2016. Generally, we expect to grow at a more by more C [ph] growth. 
Blake mentioned that during 2016, we saw double-digit growth in some revenue streams related to the connected enterprise. We expect these revenue streams to continue to grow faster than the company average in fiscal 2017. With other share gain opportunities like powertrain and OEM, this will help us to continue to generate above-market organic growth. Taking all of that into account, we expect organic growth in fiscal '17 of about 2%. We expect acquisitions to add about 1.5 points of additional growth. We expect a minor headwind from currency, about a 50 basis point reduction to sales for the full year. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming a euro rate of $1.09. 
We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be a little over $6 billion. Our guidance range for organic growth is 0 to 4%. We expect to see growth in all regions, except Canada. We expect Canada to be -- to be about flat year-over-year in '17. We expect slightly higher growth in the product businesses than in our solutions and services businesses. And given the beginning backlog in our solutions and services businesses, for the company in total, we expect to see a lower rate of growth in the first half of the year and a higher growth in the second half. 
We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%, maybe a little bit lower. That's not our normal conversion, but we know we have margin headwinds to deal with in 2017, namely the restoration of incentive compensation, an increase in operating pension expense and unfavorable currency impact that's catching up to us from the rolling of currency hedges we had in place last year. 
We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24%. That's a little higher than in 2016. The rate reflects recognition of an expected discrete benefit in the first quarter, so the rate will be lower in Q1 and higher over the balance of the year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.85 to $6.25. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And a couple of items not shown here: General corporate net expense should be approximately $75 million in 2017. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 128 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Blake already talked about last week's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2017 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases in 2017. 
The final page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '17. I think what's most relevant on this chart is that you can see graphically the fiscal '17 earning headwinds we've been talking about over the past few quarters. The restoration of incentive compensation is about a $0.25 headwind, with pension, currency and tax rate all at about $0.05. Altogether, about $0.40 of headwinds. Based on our previous and ongoing share repurchases, we expect a tailwind of about $0.15 from share count. Along with the core contribution, that's the walk to the $6.05 at the midpoint for fiscal 2017. We expect the effect of the recent acquisitions to be about neutral to adjusted EPS, including acquisition-related costs. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick, and we'll begin Q&A."

And in fact, just -- again, there in August, having joint presentations for indigenous customers about the linkage of the connected enterprise with the China Manufacturing 2025 initiative, particularly around those information solutions, the addition of EMEA software, higher-value services to complement the products and the software.

Well, I will be talking some more specifically about the role of these acquisitions and others on Thursday. But briefly, we remain primarily an organic growth company. There's no better way for us to spur our growth in performance than growth in our core platforms. That being said, the pace of the technology and the demands of customers that they have on their automation and information partners where credibility and an understanding of their best opportunities for productivity do put a little additional emphasis on acquiring and partnering for new technology and domain expertise. So it's more about the accelerated pace of the technology that may spur a little bit more activity on the acquisition side. But again, our priorities remain, first, organic growth. And then in terms of capital, acquisitions followed by dividend and share repurchase. So I don't want to signal -- I'm not signaling an interest in going after something big. We're not constrained. But our first priorities when we do consider acquisitions are: How do they accelerate our existing strategy? How do they bring us technology innovation? How do they increase our domain expertise? How do they increase our market access? And so the best acquisitions address one or more of those areas, and then we look secondarily about their impact on some portion of our financial structure."

Sales in our pro",1010,"Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. 
The quarter was a little better than our expectations. Sales in our product businesses continued to improve sequentially, and the Architecture & Software segment returned to year-over-year organic growth. Orders and sales of our solutions and services businesses, while still down year-over-year, came in as expected. Globally, oil and gas and mining remained the weakest verticals, with oil and gas down about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, it appears these markets are stabilizing. 
Consumer and automotive both had good growth in the quarter. For automotive, this was the best year-over-year growth quarter of the year. Our powertrain initiative is yielding results and is contributing toward growth and share gains in this vertical. 
From a regional perspective, in the U.S., our product businesses continued to improve sequentially and were up year-over-year for the first time this year. Food and beverage and automotive were our strongest verticals in the U.S. EMEA was down year-over-year in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected, but order growth was strong and up mid-single digits year-over-year. Our performance in Asia was stronger than we expected, with growth in most countries in the region, including China, where we saw modest year-over-year growth for the first time this year. And as expected, our organic growth rate in Latin America slowed down. Continued growth in Mexico was offset by weakness elsewhere in the region, including Brazil. 
A couple of additional comments about the quarter. Our process business was down 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued weakness in heavy industries. Logix was down 1% compared to last year, but grew again sequentially, and I'm pleased with about 20% segment margin in the quarter despite higher restructuring charges. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks. 
Moving to the full year. Fiscal 2016 was a challenging year, but I believe we executed well in difficult market conditions. Here are some key points. Throughout fiscal 2016, we've talked about significant declines in heavy industry verticals. Oil and gas was down about 25% for the year; mining, mid-teens. Weak heavy industry performance impacted process and Logix performance, which were down 15% and 4% for the year, respectively. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits. This reflects our continued success with machine builders. After several strong years, automotive continued to grow, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative, and we saw double-digit growth in revenue streams related to new value from the connected enterprise. We'll talk more about that on Thursday at our Investor Day. 
With respect to financial performance, we were able to keep our segment margin above 20% despite 7% lower reported sales. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion, over 100% of adjusted income, and we continued to return cash to shareowners, almost $900 million during fiscal 2016. Just last week, we announced a 5% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle. 
To accelerate the execution of our strategy, we acquired 3 great companies during fiscal 2016. These acquisitions further strengthen our technology differentiation, increase our domain expertise and expand market access. MagneMotion adds to our portfolio of innovative motion control solutions for consumer and transportation verticals. Automation Control Products adds new value to our software offering and applications across all industries, and MAVERICK Technologies adds expertise in chemical, consumer, life sciences and oil and gas industry applications. I believe these acquisitions will help us grow market share. 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment. 
Let's move on now to the fiscal 2017 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Since the significant declines in early 2016, oil and commodity prices have somewhat recovered, and our business in heavy industry markets generally appears to have stabilized. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of global capital expenditures. We therefore expect improvement to continue into fiscal 2017 with continued growth in the consumer and auto verticals and with heavy industries about flat year-over-year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 2% year-over-year. In addition, we project the acquisitions we made in 2016 to contribute significant growth. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2017 sales guidance of a little more than $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.25. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. 
Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you later this week at our Annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Atlanta this year. Coincidentally, Atlanta is my hometown. We again expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world for this year's Automation Fair. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions and information solutions and highlight how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners bring the connected enterprise to life. 
Regardless of the macro environment, the secular tailwinds for automation remain intact, and the opportunities provided by the connected enterprise are real. I believe we are best positioned to deliver the connected enterprise to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base. We have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. And the value we provide is in high demand as every day, customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We will continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share. 
More on Thursday during Investor Day. And with that, Ted?"

I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency trans",2135,"Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with Page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,539,000,000, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points, and acquisitions increased sales by 40 basis points. Both the organic result and the currency impact were a little better than we expected. 
Segment operating margin was 19.8%, down 1.1 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year-over-year was primarily due to lower organic sales and higher restructuring charges partly offset by favorable mix. Restructuring charges in the quarter totaled about $20 million, higher than the $10 million that we talked about in our last earnings call. We elected to go deeper with restructuring to help offset known earnings headwinds in fiscal year '17 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to areas where we believe we have the best growth opportunities in the coming year. We expect these actions to generate gross savings of over $30 million in fiscal '17 and over $40 million on a full run rate basis. 
General corporate net expense was $25 million in Q4 compared to $20 million a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter last year. In Q4 this year, the adjusted effective tax rate was lower than last year, but also better than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable mix of income across our global operations. Compared to Q4 last year, we also benefited this year from the R&D tax credit. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $1.57 in Q4 last year. The effect on adjusted EPS of lower operating earnings was partly offset by a lower tax rate and lower share count. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 is a few cents above the implied fourth quarter guidance, including the lower tax rate, but despite the higher restructuring charges. Free cash flow for Q4 was $235 million. That's another very good quarter. The rolling 4-quarter return on invested capital was 33%. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130 million. That's down 3% from Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $130 million. 
Turning to Page 5. This is the full year version of the key financial information. Sales were $5,880,000,000 for the full year, down 6.8%. Organic sales declined 3.9%. Currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.2%, down 1.4 points from last year. The primary factors were lower organic sales and the negative impact from currency effects, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Adjusted EPS was $5.93, down 7% compared to last year on a 7% reported sales decline. 
General corporate net expense was $80 million for the full year. That was about $5 million more than we talked about last quarter. Free cash flow for the full year was $834 million, which was 107% of adjusted income, a little better than our targeted conversion and previous guidance. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares at a cost of $500 million. That's right on the $500 million target that we shared last November. 
The next 2 slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on Page 6. I'll start with the quarter performance. On the left side of this chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q4, up 1.8% from the same quarter last year. Organic sales increased 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 1%, and currency translation reduced sales by 60 basis points. As Blake mentioned, this is the first quarter for year-over-year organic growth in the Architecture & Software segment in over a year. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. Architecture & Software margins in the quarter were 25.8%, down 1.5 points from Q4 last year and primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher restructuring charges. For the full year, A&S sales were down 4.2% as reported, with a 1.5% organic sales decline, a 30 basis point contribution from acquisitions and currency translation reducing sales by 3%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 26.4%, down 3 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower sales, unfavorable mix and unfavorable currency effects. 
Now on Page 7, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $842 million, down 8.8% year-over-year with an organic sales decline of 8%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 80 basis points. The organic sales in the product businesses in this segment grew by about 1%. Solutions and services business sales declined by about 14%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for solutions and services was 0.92. That's better than the typical Q4 result, but on a relatively-weak billings denominator. 
Operating margin was 14.8%, down 1.4 points compared to last year, primarily due to the significant organic sales decline, partly offset by productivity. For the full year, CP&S sales were down 8.8% year-over-year and down 5.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3%. On an organic basis for the full year, product sales in the segment were down about 2%, and solutions and services sales declined by about 8%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.2%, 30 basis points below 2015. This was a very good result despite an almost 9% drop in reported sales and largely attributable to strong productivity performance in the year. 
Page 8 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rate. Starting with the quarter, the U.S. was down about 7%, Canada down about 10%. In the U.S., our product businesses grew year-over-year in Q4 for the first time in fiscal '16. EMEA was down 3%. But as Blake noted, underlying orders were good, and it was a relatively-difficult year-over-year comparison. We saw about 5% growth in Asia Pacific, with China growth a little below that, and with India in the high single digits. This is the first quarter for organic growth in Asia Pacific and in China in more than a year. Latin America was up about 1%. Mexico was up almost 10%, but that was largely offset by declines in Brazil and the balance of the region. 
Moving to the full year. I'll try to provide some vertical color on the full year results. In the U.S. and Canada, sales declined 7%. Across all regions this year, we experienced significant weakness in heavy industries, and that was particularly true in the U.S. For the company in total, oil and gas was down about 25% for the full year, but our largest decline in oil and gas occurred in the U.S., considerably worse than the company average. Similarly, mining, which was down mid-teens year-over-year for the company, was down over 20% in the U.S. The best-growing verticals in the U.S. were food and beverage and life sciences. 
In EMEA, organic sales were up 2% year-over-year with 1% growth in the mature markets and almost 4% growth in the emerging markets. On a vertical basis, oil and gas was down about 10%, mining was down mid-single digit, and we saw particularly strong growth in life sciences and home and personal care. 
In Asia Pacific, we finished the year with sales down 5%. India saw double-digit growth, and China was down a little less than 10%. In Asia Pacific, heavy industry verticals were down across the board, except for water/wastewater. Automotive, food and beverage and life sciences were the best performing. Food and beverage was up about 20% year-over-year, primarily due to China. 
In Latin America, sales increased 7% for the full year, with Mexico over 20% and Brazil down almost 10%. Oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was about flat. We saw growth in most other verticals, with strong growth in auto and home and personal care. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 1%, with growth in Latin America and EMEA emerging markets and declines in China. 
And that takes us to the fiscal '17 guidance slide. On the revenue side, here's how we're thinking about fiscal year '17. We've seen solid sequential growth in our product businesses over the last 2 quarters of fiscal year '16. Orders in our solutions and services businesses seem to be reaching a bottom. From a vertical perspective, it appears that oil and gas and mining are stabilizing. We don't expect things to get better in fiscal year '17, but we don't expect the drag in these industries that we experienced in 2016 to continue. We expect our business in auto and consumer industries to continue to grow. We've always said that our business tracks best with levels of industrial production. Current forecasts of industrial production for fiscal year '17 indicate growth of a little over 1%. That compares to a 20 basis point decline in industrial production in 2016. Generally, we expect to grow at a more by more C [ph] growth. 
Blake mentioned that during 2016, we saw double-digit growth in some revenue streams related to the connected enterprise. We expect these revenue streams to continue to grow faster than the company average in fiscal 2017. With other share gain opportunities like powertrain and OEM, this will help us to continue to generate above-market organic growth. Taking all of that into account, we expect organic growth in fiscal '17 of about 2%. We expect acquisitions to add about 1.5 points of additional growth. We expect a minor headwind from currency, about a 50 basis point reduction to sales for the full year. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming a euro rate of $1.09. 
We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be a little over $6 billion. Our guidance range for organic growth is 0 to 4%. We expect to see growth in all regions, except Canada. We expect Canada to be -- to be about flat year-over-year in '17. We expect slightly higher growth in the product businesses than in our solutions and services businesses. And given the beginning backlog in our solutions and services businesses, for the company in total, we expect to see a lower rate of growth in the first half of the year and a higher growth in the second half. 
We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%, maybe a little bit lower. That's not our normal conversion, but we know we have margin headwinds to deal with in 2017, namely the restoration of incentive compensation, an increase in operating pension expense and unfavorable currency impact that's catching up to us from the rolling of currency hedges we had in place last year. 
We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24%. That's a little higher than in 2016. The rate reflects recognition of an expected discrete benefit in the first quarter, so the rate will be lower in Q1 and higher over the balance of the year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.85 to $6.25. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And a couple of items not shown here: General corporate net expense should be approximately $75 million in 2017. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 128 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Blake already talked about last week's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2017 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases in 2017. 
The final page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '17. I think what's most relevant on this chart is that you can see graphically the fiscal '17 earning headwinds we've been talking about over the past few quarters. The restoration of incentive compensation is about a $0.25 headwind, with pension, currency and tax rate all at about $0.05. Altogether, about $0.40 of headwinds. Based on our previous and ongoing share repurchases, we expect a tailwind of about $0.15 from share count. Along with the core contribution, that's the walk to the $6.05 at the midpoint for fiscal 2017. We expect the effect of the recent acquisitions to be about neutral to adjusted EPS, including acquisition-related costs. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick, and we'll begin Q&A."

It's good to see capital going to acquisitions, and I think you've had a pretty good 2016 in that respect. And from your prepared remarks, it sounded like you're maybe seeing other acquisition opportunities in this new fiscal year. Ted, you talked about a lower share repurchase in fiscal '17 depending on acquisition spend. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand what you're seeing out there. Now that you own MAVERICK, there may not be a large opportunity -- or as large opportunities in the -- on the system integration side. And Blake, if you could comment on your willingness to maybe do somewhat bigger deals. There's a number of attractive segments of the industrial automation industry that you're maybe not participating in today, so trying to understand your appetite there."

Well, I will be talking some more specifically about the role of these acquisitions and others on Thursday. But briefly, we remain primarily an organic growth company. There's no better way for us to spur our growth in performance than growth in our core platforms. That being said, the pace of the technology and the demands of customers that they have on their automation and information partners where credibility and an understanding of their best opportunities for productivity do put a little additional emphasis on acquiring and partnering for new technology and domain expertise. So it's more about the accelerated pace of the technology that may spur a little bit more activity on the acquisition side. But again, our priorities remain, first, organic growth. And then in terms of capital, acquisitions followed by dividend and share repurchase. So I don't want to signal -- I'm not signaling an interest in going after something big. We're not constrained. But our first priorities when we do consider acquisitions are: How do they accelerate our existing strategy? How do they bring us technology innovation? How do they increase our domain expertise? How do they increase our market access? And so the best acquisitions address one or more of those areas, and then we look secondarily about their impact on some portion of our financial structure."

I know you've made some changes there in terms of senior leadership in recent quarters. I wonder if you could talk about your strategy in China and any changes there in terms of your approach to distribution. It sounds like you're doing well with machine builders.

We remain committed to limited market-making distribution around the world, and we have seen some optimism coming from our distributors and from our salespeople who are working with distributors. We also see the need to increase our own capabilities, particularly when we're having these more-unstructured discussions about the connected enterprise. So we can't depend entirely on our distributors to make that market for us, and so we're investing in people who have skills in that area and have the expertise and the applications and the technology for driving that additional productivity. And we're looking at partners as well. Engineering companies, when they see the value of working with us, they can be a very credible source of information and value-add for those customers as well. So it's a broad approach. It remains one that includes distribution at its core, but it also includes developing our own capabilities as well as developing deeper relationships with key engineering firms."
