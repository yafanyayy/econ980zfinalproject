But I want to",1037,"Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are on the call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.
There's obviously a lot of focus on energy, and we'll talk about energy as we get further into the presentation. But I want to talk about a variety of things that we think are actually working very nicely before we get to that.
On Slide 3 in the related slides that we distributed, we've tried to highlight some of the initiatives that are working well or within our expectations. I'll touch on a few of these in my remarks here, but as an overarching comment, I would want to say that I am quite encouraged with the positive operating leverage that we achieved in the quarter. The positive revenue trajectory, the stable expense levels and solid progress that we've made on the technology project that we're pursuing. 
We are highly focused on improving the profitability and growth profile of the company, and we made very tangible progress in 2015 towards those goals. Additionally, despite the weakness in energy commodity prices, we are able to maintain strong overall asset quality metrics, and we experienced an encouraging improvement in the rate of loan growth compared to the prior quarter during the fourth quarter here. 
On Slide 4, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the third quarter, we experienced improved loan growth in the fourth quarter at $536 million or about 5% annualized. Excluding the effects of expected energy loan attrition, loan growth was more than $700 million or about 8% annualized. 
We were pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposit growth shown in the chart on the right has been a strong story for Zions for quite some time, and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most viable source, which is noninterest-bearing deposits. The value of those deposits should increase as rates rise and should lead to a strong increase in earnings if and when interest rates further increased. Thus far, we've been able to hold deposit rates quite flat.
Turning to Slide 5. The most significant source of revenue for Zions is net interest income, which equals about 78% of the fourth quarter net revenue. Although a portion of the increase from the prior quarter was driven by interest income recoveries that may not occur in the first quarter of 2016, we expect the interest rate increase in December will offset that factor. Also driving net interest income higher was the increase in both loans and securities as well as the material reduction in interest paid on debt. Accordingly, we expect we'll experience similar, if not slightly higher, net interest income in the first quarter of 2016.
On Slide 6, we were encouraged with the results from the initiatives we've made to grow fee income. Managed fee income increased 4% from the 2014 year, and we are targeting a stronger growth rate in 2016. Managed fee income is defined by assets income sources we manage directly and exclude the effect of dividends, securities gains and losses and other similar sources. 
The most significant increase in 2015 was from treasury management, which increased 13%. It also happens to be our strongest contributor to total fee income. Some of the headwinds include loan fees, which were down due in part to soft demand for energy lending as well as overdraft fees, which is attributable at least in part to strengthening consumer balance sheets. 
On Slide 7, we have the cost savings initiative scorecard graph, with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by the end of 2017. The bar on the right illustrating the cost saves that were accomplished in 2015. We remain on track to achieve the targeted cost reductions by 2017, having already realized more than half of the goal by the end of 2015. 
We're encouraged with the achievement of holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion in 2015. Additionally, our commitment is to hold that line item, adjusted for certain restructuring costs, to below $1.6 billion in 2016. We expect benefits in 2016 to include the simplification of operations that are due in part to the charter consolidation.
Moving to Slide 8. We have achieved a portion of another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which was to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below in the second half of 2015. We're encouraged with this achievement, and we are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio in 2016 of 66% or better as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1 of last year.
On Slide 9, we are satisfied with the progress we have made on our technology projects. The general ledger transition and new reporting tool conversion are complete. The credit approval workflow system software is installed in most of our banks, with the completion scheduled for the spring of this year. The same is true for the enterprise loan operations. We're tracking for a spring completion. 
Regarding our core systems replacement project, which we've dubbed Future Core and where we've partnered with Tata Consultancy Services, we're expecting a consumer loan system to roll out later this year, with commercial lending tracking for 2017 and the deposits scheduled for 2018. In summary, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for the future. These are investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where technology is obviously playing an increasingly important role.
Finally, as noted in the press release, the consolidation of our 7 subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter was completed on December 31. We'll continue to emphasize our locally-oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brand in each market we serve. And we'll find some additional efficiency from this consolidation of charters. We're very optimistic about the future operational and financial performance for Zions.
With that brief overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $88 million or $0.43 per share. Relative to the third quarter, net interest income increased about 5.5%. 
Adjusted for recoveries of interest income and a linked-quarter increase in income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased just under 3%. Actively managed noninterest income, which excludes investment-related items like security gains and losses, increased slightly from the prior quarter, and as Harris mentioned earlier, increased about 4% for the full year 2015 when compared to the full year in 2014. 
At just over $400 million, noninterest expenses were higher in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due in part to elevated levels of expenses in certain categories as detailed in the press release, which accompanied this call. We are encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to realize our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.6 billion for 2015.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. We had expected a moderate build and the reserve for energy loans partially offset by continued reserve release [indiscernible] in the portfolio. Although throughout most of the quarter, we expected the provision for loan losses to be in line with the third quarter results, the decline in the price of oil near the end of the quarter resulted in a moderately higher provision. The energy loan portfolio continued to perform about as we had expected. 
As we progress through 2016, we expect quarterly provisions to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter results. The key driver of our expectation for an elevated provision in 2016 is lower prevailing energy prices. Actual results may therefore vary from expectations if energy prices remain volatile. 
Finally, I would like to highlight the return on tangible common equity. Although we are working to drive shareholder returns to a much higher level, I'll point out that our efforts over the past year have resulted in a better than 100 basis point increase in shareholder return when compared to the same period a year ago, while capital levels have actually increased slightly during the period.
Turning to Slide 11, I'll address some of the drivers of net interest income, beginning with volume. Details of our investment portfolio are shown here on Slide 11. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the past year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the recently established liquidity coverage ratio rules. 
Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environment when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the fourth quarter, we added $1.5 billion to our investment securities portfolio on average when compared to the third quarter. In light of the general market expectation for rising short-term rates, we are exercising caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivities as we purchase fixed-rate investments and duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio. 
The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is estimated to be 2.9 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to about 3.1 years. As expected, the addition of these fixed-rate investments reduced Zion sensitivity somewhat as shown in the table at the bottom right of the page. 
Worth noting the deposit assumptions employed in our [indiscernible] case are, in fact, faster than what we are seeing in the market today, or in plain language, our scenario model assumer faster deposit repricing than we are currently observing in the market. So the improvement in net interest income from the December rate hike could and likely will be higher than that shown in the table on Slide 11.
On Page 12, we break down year-over-year loan growth. Overall, we are encouraged with our fourth quarter loan growth despite some headwinds, as Harris mentioned earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, period end loans grew at a little over 5% annualized. Net commercial and industrial loan growth for the last year was about 6% when excluding the effect of energy loan attrition. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth without an adverse change in our underwriting standards. 
Year-over-year, net churn commercial real estate growth was about 8% when removing the effect of national real estate portfolio. Residential mortgage continues to be a major focus for growth across our geographic footprint. The other category experienced healthy growth from subcategories such as home equity and municipal lending.
The 2 portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more are the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolios. Financial real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans, and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point to the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. The rate of decline is slowing for this portfolio, and it currently accounts for less than 50% of tangible common equity. 
The energy portfolio attrition is well-documented as we have discussed this regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. We expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. To summarize, our outlook on loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which should be in the low to mid-single-digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the yield or on the portfolio [indiscernible] can be found on Slide 13. This slide key components of our net interest margin, the top line is the loan yield, which increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to average 4.24%. As described in the press release, there was a recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield. Excluding this recovery, the loan yields on the portfolio declined about 2 basis points from the prior quarter. 
The securities portfolio yield declined slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the redemption of high-cost subordinated debt. The net interest margin increased to 3.23%, a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter.
And adjusted for the income recovery, the net interest margin would have been about 3.18%. This increase is largely attributable to the change in earning asset mix, more loans and securities in the fourth quarter and less cash as well as the previously mentioned reduction of high-cost subordinated debt.
Slide 14 provides more detail on loan yields, specifically, the coupon and loan production [indiscernible] portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risk of future yield on loans and current interest rate environment. The yellow line reflects the GAAP yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for this increase is the previously mentioned interest recovery. 
Importantly, the weighted average coupon of loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon, of course, excludes the effect of amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production also stabilized in the fourth quarter as we saw the yield on larger loans improved somewhat in December, reflective of the moving LIBOR. Although our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the small loan space, our production coupons have been stable.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 15. I'll be brief and say that we continue to experience generally strong credit quality performance in both geographies and segments, with the notable exception of energy-related loans, which are included in our C&I segment. Our reserve for credit loss is quite strong at just under 1.7% of loans, which is nearly 2x our nonperforming assets and over a decade worth of charge-offs based on the fourth quarter annualized results. Despite an increase in classified energy-related loans of just under -- I'm sorry, just over $76 million from the prior quarter level, overall classified loans increased only $45 million or 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Nonperforming assets declined slightly from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined due to recoveries, which were $32 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross charge-offs were relatively stable when compared to the prior quarter. Our outlook for 2016 net charge-offs is between 30 and 35 basis points of average loans. The majority of these charge-offs are expected to be energy-related. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and the Houston market more broadly."

Without repeated the table that we have in our earnings release on Page 4 of the earnings release in this -- in the main section of this slide deck can be found in the appendix, but let me just make some summary comments. 
As noted in the press release, energy loan outstandings and commitments declined fairly substantially from the prior quarter and from a year ago. We commented that we believe this would happen throughout 2015. The decline in outstandings was about $450 million compared to a year ago, and commitments are down approximately $1 billion since a year ago. 
Classified energy loan balances increased by approximately $76 million from the prior quarter and finished at a level that is actually somewhat better than what we would have expected a year ago. Nonaccrual energy loans declined from the prior quarter, primarily due to net charge-offs, which is not the way you want to reduce that bucket, but it's important to note that the level did not increase much if you adjust for net charge-offs.
Turning to Slide 16. Let's see, it's not Slide 16. Slide 17. Yes. As we noted since late 2014, we have been extremely active in managing the energy portfolio, including the full attention of our entire executive team, reviewing the portfolio frequently on a credit-by-credit basis plus significant interaction with our customers. Based upon that input, along with our models, we are updating our outlook for energy loan losses. 
As noted previously, these various methodologies led us to an estimated energy loan -- energy loan losses of between $75 million to $125 million for the 9-quarter period ending the fourth quarter of 2016. That was estimated more than a year ago based upon oil prices near $50. It is obviously considerably -- the price of oil was obviously considerably lower than that today, with most of that decline occurring during December 2015 and January 2016. So it's appropriate to provide an update about loss expectation. 
Assuming $30 per barrel for the next several quarters, we estimate that energy loan losses will be between $75 million and $100 million in 2016. This is on the high end of the initial range but has been driven by the decline in the oil and gas prices relative to the initial expectation. And as Paul just mentioned, we expect total losses for the company to remain manageable, with net charge-offs ranging between 30 and 35 basis points for the entire consolidated portfolio. We continue to build our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 5%. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures loss expectations that we've reported in the past and have been reported by peers.
On Slide 17, we are providing some additional disclosures on trends in various major types of energy credits, with the orange line representing upstream or exploration and production loans; the green line representing energy services; and the yellow line representing all other energy-related loans. 
On the left is the trend in balances outstanding. Despite the capital markets being somewhat quiet in the fourth quarter, we still experienced a substantial decline in balances as borrowers continued to sell assets and used cash flow to reduce debt. On the right -- on the top right is the trend in classified energy loans by subtype, with services increasing during fourth quarter, while classified E&P companies experienced a decline in that quarter. Nonaccruals are shown at the bottom. We expect continued downgrades but we expect that the situation, as noted before, will be manageable. 
On Slide 18, we show an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left-hand side of each bar represents the Houston exposure. The point of this slide really is the Houston CRE portfolio is diversified across a variety of asset types product categories, and we are not concentrated in any one particular area, with a very minimal exposure to land.
Slide 19 is [indiscernible  for us, which shows the commercial real estate portfolio by cash flow and collateral support. You'll notice that there's very low in the way of tail risk. Property values could decline or cash flow could decline substantially, and very few properties would run into substantial trouble. 
While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure which are worth mentioning. When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us much more conservatively today. They include: first, that our total commercial real estate balances are approximately $1.2 billion less today than they were going into 2008; and exposure to land is down more than 80% from what we saw going into the previous cycle. 
Additionally, our mix of construction lending and CRE term lending has shifted much more to CRE term. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office and multifamily construction financing is almost double today what it was going into the previous cycle of 2008. With that as a bit of a backdrop, Paul, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans, due primarily to factors already discussed earlier in our comments.Over t",441,"Thanks, Scott. Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans, due primarily to factors already discussed earlier in our comments.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect net interest income to increase from the fourth quarter levels. We anticipate continued loan and security growth and additional benefit from December's slight rate increase, which will outpace the headwinds of 1 fewer day of interest income and no anticipated large interest income recoveries. 
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $100 million for every 100 basis point increase in short-term rates. We expect our quarterly provision that is moderately higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming energy prices remain near current levels. We expect to maintain a strong reserve ratio on energy loans. 
We expect the noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on these line items. As a reminder, dividend from federal agencies, namely the Federal Home Loan Bank, will decline due to the charter consolidation. You may recall we had multiple memberships to several federal home loan banks, and we're consolidating those to a single federal home loan bank. And due to the Fast Act, which is more commonly known as the Highway Spending Bill and its impact on dividends from the Federal Reserve. 
Noninterest expense, as stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 4 basis points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter related to alternative energy and research and development. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 34% in 2016, which may fluctuate somewhat due to how much of our investment in technology projects is eligible for tax credits. 
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. The tender offer completed in the fourth quarter reduces preferred dividends by approximately $10 million annually, although the amounts are uneven. For example, assuming no changes to the outstanding preferred equity from today, the first and third quarter dividend rates are expected to be 112 [ph] -- or I'm sorry, $12 million each, and the second and fourth quarters should be approximately $15 million each.
This concludes our prepared remarks. So would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

I mean, the nice thing about the reserve-based lending is that it is unlike any other type of commercial lending we do, it is made to adjust on a periodic basis.

And the industry, E&P companies, they know how to live within their cash flow generally speaking problem so won't encounter problems, but they know how to ratchet back cash flow. And it fundamentally comes in the form of controlling their CapEx. But they have many other things to control, including the cost that they receive from services companies, which are down anywhere from 25% to 35% in 2016. The other thing that you probably read about is that just lifting cost. Pure cash lifting costs, depending on the company, depending on the reservoir, et cetera, et cetera, are generally in the $7 to $12 range, pure cash lifting cost.

But I want to",1040,"Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are on the call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.
There's obviously a lot of focus on energy, and we'll talk about energy as we get further into the presentation. But I want to talk about a variety of things that we think are actually working very nicely before we get to that.
On Slide 3 in the related slides that we distributed, we've tried to highlight some of the initiatives that are working well or within our expectations. I'll touch on a few of these in my remarks here, but as an overarching comment, I would want to say that I am quite encouraged with the positive operating leverage that we achieved in the quarter, the positive revenue trajectory, the stable expense levels and the solid progress that we've made on the technology project that we're pursuing.
We are highly focused on improving the profitability and growth profile of the company, and we made very tangible progress in 2015 towards those goals. Additionally, despite the weakness in energy commodity prices, we are able to maintain strong overall asset quality metrics, and we experienced an encouraging improvement in the rate of loan growth compared to the prior quarter during the fourth quarter here.
On Slide 4, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the third quarter, we experienced improved loan growth in the fourth quarter at $536 million or about 5% annualized. Excluding the effects of expected energy loan attrition, loan growth was more than $700 million or about 8% annualized.
We were pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposit growth shown in the chart on the right has been a strong story for Zions for quite some time, and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most viable source, which is noninterest-bearing deposits. The value of those deposits should increase as rates rise and should lead to a strong increase in earnings if and when interest rates further increase. Thus far, we've been able to hold deposit rates quite flat.
Turning to Slide 5. The most significant source of revenue for Zions is net interest income, which equals about 78% of the fourth quarter net revenue. Although a portion of the increase from the prior quarter was driven by interest income recoveries that may not occur in the first quarter of 2016, we expect the interest rate increase in December will offset that factor. Also driving net interest income higher was the increase in both loans and securities as well as the material reduction in interest paid on debt. Accordingly, we expect we'll experience similar, if not slightly higher, net interest income in the first quarter of 2016.
On Slide 6, we were encouraged with the results from the initiatives we've made to grow fee income. Managed fee income increased 4% from the 2014 year, and we are targeting a stronger growth rate in 2016. Managed fee income is defined by us as income sources we manage directly and excludes the effect of dividends, security gains and losses and other similar sources.
The most significant increase in 2015 was from treasury management, which increased 13%. It also happens to be our strongest contributor to total fee income. Some of the headwinds include loan fees, which were down due in part to soft demand for energy lending as well as overdraft fees, which is attributable at least in part to strengthening consumer balance sheets.
On Slide 7, we have the cost savings initiative scorecard graph, with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by the end of 2017, the bar on the right illustrating the cost saves that were accomplished in 2015. We remain on track to achieve the targeted cost reductions by 2017, having already realized more than half of the goal by the end of 2015.
We're encouraged with the achievement of holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion in 2015. Additionally, our commitment is to hold that line item, adjusted for certain restructuring costs, to below $1.6 billion in 2016. We expect benefits in 2016 to include the simplification of operations that are due in part to the charter consolidation.
Moving to Slide 8. We have achieved a portion of another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which was to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below in the second half of 2015. We're encouraged with this achievement, and we are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio in 2016 of 66% or better as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1 of last year.
On Slide 9, we are satisfied with the progress we have made on our technology projects. The general ledger transition and new reporting tool conversion are complete. The credit approval workflow system software is installed in most of our banks, with the completion scheduled for the spring of this year. The same is true for the enterprise loan operations. We're tracking for a spring completion.
Regarding our core systems replacement project, which we've dubbed FutureCore and where we've partnered with Tata Consultancy Services, we're expecting the consumer loan system to roll out later this year, with commercial lending tracking for 2017 and the deposits module scheduled for 2018. In summary, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future. These are investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where technology is obviously playing an increasingly important role.
Finally, as noted in the press release, the consolidation of our 7 subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter was completed on December 31. We'll continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brand in each market we serve. But we'll find some additional efficiency from this consolidation of charters. We're very optimistic about the future operational and financial performance for Zions.
With that brief overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $88 million or $0.43 per share. Relative to the third quarter, net interest income increased about 5.5%.
Adjusted for recoveries of interest income and a linked-quarter increase in income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased just under 3%. Actively managed noninterest income, which excludes investment-related items like security gains and losses, increased slightly from the prior quarter, and as Harris mentioned earlier, increased about 4% for the full year 2015 when compared to the full year 2014.
At just over $400 million, noninterest expenses were higher in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due in part to elevated levels of expenses in certain categories as detailed in the press release, which accompanied this call. We are encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to realize our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.6 billion for 2015.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. We had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans partially offset by continued reserve release in the portfolio. Although throughout most of the quarter, we expected the provision for loan losses to be in line with the third quarter results, the decline in the price of oil near the end of the quarter resulted in a moderately higher provision. The energy loan portfolio continued to perform about as we had expected.
As we progress through 2016, we expect quarterly provisions to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter results. The key driver of our expectation for an elevated provision in 2016 is lower prevailing energy prices. Actual results may therefore vary from expectations if energy prices remain volatile.
Finally, I would like to highlight the return on tangible common equity. Although we are working to drive shareholder returns to a much higher level, I'll point out that our efforts over the past year have resulted in a better than 100 basis point increase in shareholder returns when compared to the same period a year ago, while capital levels have actually increased slightly during the period.
Turning to Slide 11. I'll address some of the drivers of net interest income, beginning with volume. Details of our investment portfolio are shown here on Slide 11. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the past year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the recently established liquidity coverage ratio rules.
Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environment when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the fourth quarter, we added $1.5 billion to our investment securities portfolio on average when compared to the third quarter. In light of the general market expectation for rising short-term rates, we are exercising caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments and duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio.
The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is estimated to be 2.9 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to about 3.1 years. As expected, the addition of these fixed-rate investments reduced Zions' asset sensitivity somewhat as shown in the table at the bottom right of the page.
Worth noting, the deposit beta assumptions employed in our ""Slowed"" case are, in fact, faster than what we are seeing in the market today, or in plain language, our ""Slow"" scenario model assumes faster deposit repricing than we are currently observing in the market. So the improvement in net interest income from the December rate hike could and likely will be higher than that shown in the table on Slide 11.
On Page 12, we break down year-over-year loan growth. Overall, we are encouraged with our fourth quarter loan growth despite some headwinds, as Harris mentioned earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew at a little over 5% annualized. Net commercial and industrial loan growth for the last year was about 6% when excluding the effect of energy loan attrition. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth without an adverse change in our underwriting standards.
Year-over-year, net churn in commercial real estate growth was about 8% when removing the effect of national real estate portfolio. Residential mortgage continues to be a major focus for growth across our geographic footprint. The other category experienced healthy growth from various subcategories such as home equity and municipal lending.
The 2 portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more are the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio. The national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans, and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point to the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. The rate of decline is slowing for this portfolio, and it currently accounts for less than 50% of tangible common equity.
The energy portfolio attrition is well documented as we have discussed this regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. We expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. To summarize, our outlook on loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which should be in the low to mid-single-digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the yield or rates on the portfolio and loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is the loan yield, which increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to average 4.24%. As described in the press release, there was a recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield. Excluding this recovery, the loan yield on the portfolio declined about 2 basis points from the prior quarter.
The securities portfolio yield declined slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the redemption of high-cost subordinated debt. The net interest margin increased to 3.23%, a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter.
If adjusted for the income recovery, the net interest margin would have been about 3.18%. This increase is largely attributable to the change in earning asset mix, more loans and securities in the fourth quarter and less cash as well as the previously mentioned reduction of high-cost subordinated debt.
Slide 14 provides more detail on loan yields, specifically the coupon on new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risk to the future yield on loans in the current interest rate environment. The yellow line reflects the GAAP yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for this increase is the previously mentioned interest recoveries.
Importantly, the weighted average coupon of loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon, of course, excludes the effect of amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production also stabilized in the fourth quarter as we saw the yield on larger loans improved somewhat in December, reflective of the move in LIBOR. Although our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the small loan space, our production coupons have been stable.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 15. I'll be brief and say that we continue to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments, with the notable exception of energy-related loans, which are included in our C&I segment. Our reserve for credit loss is quite strong at just under 1.7% of loans, which is nearly 2x our nonperforming assets and over a decade worth of charge-offs based on the fourth quarter annualized results. Despite an increase in classified energy-related loans of just under -- I'm sorry, just over $76 million from the prior quarter level, overall classified loans increased only $45 million or 3% in the fourth quarter.
Nonperforming assets declined slightly from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined due to recoveries, which were $32 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross charge-offs were relatively stable when compared to the prior quarter. Our outlook for 2016 net charge-offs is between 30 and 35 basis points of average loans. The majority of these charge-offs are expected to be energy-related.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and the Houston market more broadly."

But let me just m",887,"Thank you, Paul, and I'll start on Slide 17. We've not repeated the table that we have in our earnings release on Page 4 of the earnings release in this -- in the main section of this slide deck, although it can be found in the appendix. But let me just make some summary comments.
As noted in the press release, energy loan outstandings and commitments declined fairly substantially from the prior quarter and from a year ago. We commented that we believe this would happen throughout 2015. The decline in outstandings was about $450 million compared to a year ago, and commitments are down approximately $1 billion since a year ago.
Classified energy loan balances increased by approximately $76 million from the prior quarter and finished at a level that is actually somewhat better than what we would have expected a year ago. Nonaccrual energy loans declined from the prior quarter, primarily due to net charge-offs, which is not the way you want to reduce that bucket. But it's important to note that the level did not increase much if you adjust for net charge-offs.
Turning to Slide 16 -- let's see. It's not Slide 16. It's probably Slide 17, yes. Or is it -- sorry, yes. As we noted since late 2014, we have been extremely active in managing the energy portfolio, including the full attention of our entire executive team, reviewing the portfolio frequently on a credit-by-credit basis plus significant interaction with our customers. Based upon that input, along with our models, we are updating our outlook for energy loan losses.
As noted previously, these various methodologies led us to an estimated energy loan -- energy loan losses of between $75 million to $125 million for the 9-quarter period ending the fourth quarter of 2016. That was estimated more than a year ago based upon oil prices near $50. It is obviously considerably -- the price of oil was obviously considerably lower than that today, with most of that decline occurring during December 2015 and January 2016. So it's appropriate to provide an update to that loss expectation.
Assuming $30 per barrel for the next several quarters, we estimate that energy loan losses will be between $75 million and $100 million in 2016. This is on the high end of the initial range but has been driven by the decline in the oil and gas prices relative to the initial expectation. And as Paul just mentioned, we expect total losses for the company to remain manageable, with net charge-offs ranging between 30 and 35 basis points for the entire consolidated portfolio. We continue to build our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 5%. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations that we've reported in the past and that have been reported by peers.
On Slide 17, we are providing some additional disclosures on trends in the various major types of energy credits, with the orange line representing upstream or exploration and production loans; the green line representing energy services; and the yellow line representing all other energy-related loans.
On the left is the trend in balances outstanding. Despite the capital markets being somewhat quiet in the fourth quarter, we still experienced a substantial decline in balances as borrowers continue to sell assets and use cash flow to reduce debt. On the right -- on the top right is the trend in classified energy loans by subtype, with services increasing during the fourth quarter, while classified E&P companies experienced a decline in that quarter. Nonaccruals are shown at the bottom. We expect continued downgrades but we expect that the situation, as noted before, will be manageable.
On Slide 18, we show an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left-hand side of each bar represents the Houston exposure. The point of this slide really is that the Houston CRE portfolio is diversified across a variety of asset types, product categories, and we are not concentrated in any one particular area, with very minimal exposure to land.
Slide 19 is a new disclosure for us, which shows the commercial real estate portfolio by cash flow and collateral support. You'll notice that there's very little in the way of tail risk. Property values could decline or cash flow could decline substantially, and very few properties would run into substantial trouble.
While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure which are worth mentioning. When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us much more conservatively today. They include, first, that our total commercial real estate balances are approximately $1.2 billion less today than they were going into 2008; and our exposure to land is down more than 80% from what we saw going into the previous cycle.
Additionally, our mix of construction lending and CRE term lending has shifted much more to CRE term. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office and multifamily construction financing is almost double today what it was going into the previous cycle of 2008. With that as a bit of a backdrop, Paul, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter.

Over the next 4 quarters, we expect net interest income to increase from the fourth quarter level. We anticipate continued loan and security growth and additional benefit from December's slight rate increase, which will outpace the headwinds of 1 fewer day of interest income and no anticipated large interest income recoveries.
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $100 million for every 100 basis point increase in short-term rates. We expect a quarterly provision that is moderately higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming energy prices remain near current levels. We expect to maintain a strong reserve ratio on energy loans.
We expect the noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on these line items. As a reminder, dividend from federal agencies, namely the Federal Home Loan Banks, will decline due to the charter consolidation. You may recall we had multiple memberships to several Federal Home Loan Banks, and we're consolidating those to a single Federal Home Loan Bank. And due to the FAST Act, which is more commonly known as the highway spending bill and its impact on dividends from the Federal Reserve.
Noninterest expense, as stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 4 basis points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter related to alternative energy and research and development. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 34% in 2016, which may fluctuate somewhat due to how much of our investment in technology projects is eligible for tax credits.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. The tender offer completed in the fourth quarter reduces preferred dividends by approximately $10 million annually, although the amounts are uneven. For example, assuming no changes to the outstanding preferred equity from today, the first and third quarter dividend rates are expected to be 112 -- or I'm sorry, $12 million each, and the second and fourth quarters should be approximately $15 million each.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Sabrina, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

Recall that on the services side of our portfolio, about 35% of the portfolio is term if amortizing on a little less than a 5-year basis. And so we're continuing to see reductions there. And then the last comment I would make is that during the year, we had approximately $140 million of capital contributed by private equity firms, and that didn't all go to support reductions. But it -- a portion of it did. And additionally, we saw about $150 million in loan commitments reduced as a result of restructurings that we did.

But some of the business units are originating new terms so that we can continue to create a more stabilized CRE portfolio with stabilized income streams."

But I want to",1038,"Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are on the call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.
There's obviously a lot of focus on energy, and we'll talk about energy as we get further into the presentation. But I want to talk about a variety of things that we think are actually working very nicely before we get to that.
On Slide 3 in the related slides that we've distributed, we've tried to highlight some of the initiatives that are working well or within our expectations. I'll touch on a few of these in my remarks here, but as an overarching comment, I would want to say that I am quite encouraged with the positive operating leverage that we achieved in the quarter, the positive revenue trajectory, the stable expense levels and solid progress that we've made on the technology projects that we're pursuing.
We are highly focused on improving the profitability and growth profile of the company, and we made very tangible progress in 2015 towards those goals. Additionally, despite the weakness in energy commodity prices, we are able to maintain strong overall asset quality metrics, and we experienced an encouraging improvement in the rate of loan growth compared to the prior quarter during the fourth quarter here.
On Slide 4, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the third quarter, we experienced improved loan growth in the fourth quarter at $536 million or about 5% annualized. Excluding the effects of expected energy loan attrition, loan growth was more than $700 million or about 8% annualized.
We were pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposit growth shown in the chart on the right has been a strong story for Zions for quite some time, and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most valuable source, which is noninterest-bearing deposits. The value of those deposits should increase as rates rise and should lead to a strong increase in earnings if and when interest rates further increase. Thus far, we've been able to hold deposit rates quite flat.
Turning to Slide 5. The most significant source of revenue for Zions is net interest income, which equals about 78% of the fourth quarter net revenue. Although a portion of the increase from the prior quarter was driven by interest income recoveries that may not occur in the first quarter of 2016, we expect the interest rate increase in December will offset that factor. Also driving net interest income higher was the increase in both loans and securities as well as the material reduction in interest paid on debt. Accordingly, we expect we'll experience similar, if not slightly higher, net interest income in the first quarter of 2016.
On Slide 6, we were encouraged with the results from the initiatives we've made to grow fee income. Managed fee income increased 4% from the 2014 year, and we are targeting a stronger growth rate in 2016. Managed fee income is defined by us as income sources we manage directly and excludes the effect of dividends, securities gains and losses and other similar sources.
The most significant increase in 2015 was from treasury management, which increased 13%. It also happens to be our strongest contributor to total fee income. Some of the headwinds include loan fees, which were down due in part to soft demand for energy lending as well as overdraft fees, which is attributable at least in part to strengthening consumer balance sheets.
On Slide 7, we have the cost savings initiative scorecard graph, with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by the end of 2017; the bar on the right illustrating the cost saves that were accomplished in 2015. We remain on track to achieve the targeted cost reductions by 2017, having already realized more than half of the goal by the end of 2015.
We're encouraged with the achievement of holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion in 2015. Additionally, our commitment is to hold that line item, adjusted for certain restructuring costs, to below $1.6 billion in 2016. We expect benefits in 2016 to include the simplification of operations that are due in part to the charter consolidation.
Moving to Slide 8. We have achieved a portion of another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which was to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below in the second half of 2015. We're encouraged with this achievement, and we are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio in 2016 of 66% or better as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1 of last year.
On Slide 9, we are satisfied with the progress we have made on our technology projects. The general ledger transition and new reporting tool conversion are complete. The credit approval workflow system software is installed in most of our banks, with the completion scheduled for the spring of this year. The same is true for the enterprise loan operations. We're tracking for a spring completion.
Regarding our core systems replacement project, which we've dubbed FutureCore where we've partnered with Tata Consultancy Services, we're expecting the consumer loan system to roll out later this year, with commercial lending tracking for 2017 and the deposits module scheduled for 2018. In summary, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future. These are investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where technology is obviously playing an increasingly important role.
Finally, as noted in the press release, the consolidation of our 7 subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter was completed on December 31. We'll continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brands in each market we serve. But we'll find some additional efficiency from this consolidation of charters. We're very optimistic about the future operational and financial performance for Zions.
With that brief overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $88 million or $0.43 per share. Relative to the third quarter, net interest income increased about 5.5%.
Adjusted for recoveries of interest income and a linked-quarter increase in income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased just under 3%. Actively managed noninterest income, which excludes investment-related items like securities gains and losses, increased slightly from the prior quarter, and as Harris noted earlier, increased about 4% for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014.
At just over $400 million, noninterest expenses were higher in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due in part to elevated levels of expenses in certain categories as detailed in the press release, which accompanied this call. We are encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to realize our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.6 billion for 2015.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. We had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans partially offset by continued reserve release in the rest of the portfolio. Although throughout most of the quarter, we expected the provision for loan losses to be in line with the third quarter results, the decline in the price of oil near the end of the quarter resulted in a moderately higher provision. The energy loan portfolio continued to perform about as we had expected.
As we progress through 2016, we expect quarterly provisions to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter results. The key driver of our expectation for an elevated provision in 2016 is the lower prevailing energy prices. Actual results may therefore vary from expectations if energy prices remain volatile.
Finally, I would like to highlight the return on tangible common equity. Although we are working to drive shareholder returns to a much higher level, I'll point out that our efforts over the past year have resulted in a better than 100 basis point increase in shareholder returns when compared to the same period a year ago, while capital levels have actually increased slightly during the period.
Turning to Slide 11. I'll address some of the drivers of net interest income, beginning with volume. Details of our investment portfolio are shown here on Slide 11. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the past year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the recently established liquidity coverage ratio rules.
Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the fourth quarter, we added $1.5 billion to our investment securities portfolio on average when compared to the third quarter. In light of the general market expectation for rising short-term rates, we are exercising caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivities as we purchase fixed-rate investments and duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio.
The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is estimated to be 2.9 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to about 3.1 years. As expected, the addition of these fixed-rate investments reduce Zions' asset sensitivity somewhat as shown in the table at the bottom right of the page.
Worth noting, the deposit beta assumptions employed in our ""Slowed"" case are, in fact, faster than what we are seeing in the market today, or in plain language, our ""Slow"" scenario model assumes faster deposit repricing than we are currently observing in the market. So the improvement in net interest income from the December rate hike could and likely will be higher than that shown in the table on Slide 11.
On Page 12, we break down year-over-year loan growth. Overall, we are encouraged with our fourth quarter loan growth despite some headwinds, as Harris mentioned earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew at a little over 5% annualized. Net commercial and industrial loan growth for the last year was about 6% when excluding the effect of energy loan attrition. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth without an adverse change in our underwriting standards.
Year-over-year, net churn in commercial real estate growth was about 8% when removing the effect of national real estate portfolio. Residential mortgage continues to be a major focus for growth across our geographic footprint. The other category experienced healthy growth from various subcategories such as home equity and municipal lending.
The 2 portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more are the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio. The national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans, and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point to the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. The rate of decline is slowing for this portfolio, and it currently accounts for less than 50% of tangible common equity.
The energy portfolio attrition is well documented as we have discussed this regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. We expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. To summarize, our outlook on loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which should be in the low to mid-single digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the yield or rates on the portfolio and loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is the loan yield, which increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to average 4.24%. As described in the press release, there was a recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield. Excluding this recovery, the loan yield on the portfolio declined about 2 basis points from the prior quarter.
The securities portfolio yield declined slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the redemption of high-cost subordinated debt. The net interest margin increased to 3.23%, a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter.
If adjusted for the income recovery, the net interest margin would have been about 3.18%. This increase is largely attributable to the change in earning asset mix, more loans and securities in the fourth quarter and less cash as well as the previously mentioned reduction of high-cost subordinated debt.
Slide 14 provides more detail on loan yields, specifically the coupon on new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risk to the future yield on loans in the current interest rate environment. The yellow line reflects the GAAP yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for this increase is the previously mentioned interest recoveries.
Importantly, the weighted average coupon of the loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon, of course, excludes the effect of amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production also stabilized in the fourth quarter as we saw the yield on larger loans improved somewhat in December, reflective of the move in LIBOR. Although our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the small loan space, our production coupons have been stable.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 15. I'll be brief and say that we continue to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments, with the notable exception of energy-related loans, which are included in our C&I segment. Our reserve for credit loss is quite strong at just under 1.7% of loans, which is nearly 2x our nonperforming assets and over a decade's worth of charge-offs based on the fourth quarter annualized results. Despite an increase in classified energy-related loans of just under -- I'm sorry, just over $76 million from the prior quarter level, overall classified loans increased only $45 million or 3% in the fourth quarter.
Nonperforming assets declined slightly from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined due to recoveries, which were $32 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross charge-offs were relatively stable when compared to the prior quarter. Our outlook for 2016 net charge-offs is between 30 and 35 basis points of average loans. The majority of these charge-offs are expected to be energy-related.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and the Houston market more broadly."

We've not repeated the table that we have in our earnings release on Page 4 of the earnings release in this -- in the main section of this slide deck, although it can be found in the appendix. But let me just make some summary comments.
As noted in the press release, energy loan outstandings and commitments declined fairly substantially from the prior quarter and from a year ago. We commented that we believe this would happen throughout 2015. The decline in outstandings was about $450 million compared to a year ago, and commitments are down approximately $1 billion since a year ago.
Classified energy loan balances increased by approximately $76 million from the prior quarter and finished at a level that is actually somewhat better than what we would have expected a year ago. Nonaccrual energy loans declined from the prior quarter, primarily due to net charge-offs, which is not the way you want to reduce that bucket. But it's important to note that the level did not increase much if you adjust for net charge-offs.
Turning to Slide 16 -- let's see. It's not Slide 16. It's probably Slide 17, yes. Or is it -- sorry, yes. As we noted since late 2014, we have been extremely active in managing the energy portfolio, including the full attention of our entire executive team, reviewing the portfolio frequently on a credit-by-credit basis plus significant interaction with our customers. Based upon that input, along with our models, we are updating our outlook for energy loan losses.
As noted previously, these various methodologies led us to an estimated energy loan -- energy loan losses of between $75 million to $125 million for the 9-quarter period ending the fourth quarter of 2016. That was estimated more than a year ago based upon oil prices near $50. It is obviously considerably -- the price of oil was obviously considerably lower than that today, with most of that decline occurring during December 2015 and January 2016. So it's appropriate to provide an update to that loss expectation.
Assuming $30 per barrel for the next several quarters, we estimate that energy loan losses will be between $75 million and $100 million in 2016. This is on the high end of the initial range, but has been driven by the decline in the oil and gas prices relative to the initial expectation. And as Paul just mentioned, we expect total losses for the company to remain manageable, with net charge-offs ranging between 30 and 35 basis points for the entire consolidated portfolio. We continue to build our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 5%. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations that we've reported in the past and that have been reported by peers.
On Slide 17, we are providing some additional disclosures on trends in the various major types of energy credits, with the orange line representing upstream or exploration and production loans; the green line representing energy services; and the yellow line representing all other energy-related loans.
On the left is the trend in balances outstanding. Despite the capital markets being somewhat quiet in the fourth quarter, we still experienced a substantial decline in balances as borrowers continue to sell assets and use cash flow to reduce debt. On the right -- on the top right is the trend in classified energy loans by subtype, with services increasing during the fourth quarter, while classified E&P companies experienced a decline in that quarter. Nonaccruals are shown at the bottom. We expect continued downgrades but we expect that the situation, as noted before, will be manageable.
On Slide 18, we show an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left-hand side of each bar represents the Houston exposure. The point of this slide really is that the Houston CRE portfolio is diversified across a variety of asset types, product categories, and we are not concentrated in any one particular area, with very minimal exposure to land.
Slide 19 is a new disclosure for us, which shows the commercial real estate portfolio by cash flow and collateral support. You'll notice that there's very little in the way of tail risk. Property values could decline or cash flow could decline substantially, and very few properties would run into substantial trouble.
While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure which are worth mentioning. When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us much more conservatively today. They include, first, that our total commercial real estate balances are approximately $1.2 billion less today than they were going into 2008; and our exposure to land is down more than 80% from what we saw going into the previous cycle.
Additionally, our mix of construction lending and CRE term lending has shifted much more to CRE term. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office and multifamily construction financing is almost double today what it was going into the previous cycle of 2008. With that as a bit of a backdrop, Paul, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans due primarily to factors already discussed earlier in our comments.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect net interest income to increase from the fourth quarter level. We anticipate continued loan and security growth and additional benefit from December's slight rate increase, which will outpace the headwinds of 1 fewer day of interest income and no anticipated large interest income recoveries.
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $100 million for every 100 basis point increase in short-term rates. We expect a quarterly provision that is moderately higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming energy prices remain near current levels. We expect to maintain a strong reserve ratio on energy loans.
We expect the noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on these line items. As a reminder, dividends from federal agencies, namely the Federal Home Loan Banks, will decline due to the charter consolidation. You may recall we had multiple memberships to several Federal Home Loan Banks, and we're consolidating those to a single Federal Home Loan Bank. And due to the FAST Act, which is more commonly known as the highway spending bill and its impact on dividends from the Federal Reserve.
Noninterest expense, as stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 4 basis points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter related to alternative energy and research and development. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 34% in 2016, which may fluctuate somewhat due to how much of our investment in technology projects is eligible for tax credits.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. The tender offer completed in the fourth quarter reduces preferred dividends by approximately $10 million annually, although the amounts are uneven. For example, assuming no changes to the outstanding preferred equity from today, the first and third quarter dividend rates are expected to be 112 -- or I'm sorry, $12 million each, and the second and fourth quarters should be approximately $15 million each.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Sabrina, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

It doesn't mean they won't encounter problems, they will encounter problems, but they know how to ratchet back cash flow. And it's -- fundamentally comes in the form of controlling their CapEx. But they have many other things to control, including the cost that they receive from services companies, which are down anywhere from 25% to 35% in 2016. The other thing that you've probably read about is that just lifting costs -- pure cash lifting costs, depending on the company, depending on the reservoir, et cetera, et cetera, are generally in the $7 to $12 range, pure cash lifting costs.

But I want to",1039,"Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are on the call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results.
There's obviously a lot of focus on energy, and we'll talk about energy as we get further into the presentation. But I want to talk about a variety of things that we think are actually working very nicely before we get to that.
On Slide 3 in the related slides that we've distributed, we've tried to highlight some of the initiatives that are working well and are within our expectations. I'll touch on a few of these in my remarks here, but as an overarching comment, I would want to say that I am quite encouraged with the positive operating leverage that we achieved in the quarter, the positive revenue trajectory, the stable expense levels and solid progress that we've made on the technology projects that we're pursuing.
We are highly focused on improving the profitability and growth profile of the company, and we made very tangible progress in 2015 towards those goals. Additionally, despite the weakness in energy commodity prices, we are able to maintain strong overall asset quality metrics, and we experienced an encouraging improvement in the rate of loan growth compared to the prior quarter during the fourth quarter here.
On Slide 4, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the third quarter, we experienced improved loan growth in the fourth quarter of $536 million or about 5% annualized. Excluding the effects of expected energy loan attrition, loan growth was more than $700 million or about 8% annualized.
We were pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposit growth shown in the chart on the right has been a strong story for Zions for quite some time, and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most viable source, which is noninterest-bearing deposits. The value of those deposits should increase as rates rise and should lead to a strong increase in earnings if and when interest rates further increase. Thus far, we've been able to hold deposit rates quite flat.
Turning to Slide 5. The most significant source of revenue for Zions is net interest income, which equals about 78% of the fourth quarter net revenue. Although a portion of the increase from the prior quarter was driven by interest income recoveries that may not occur in the first quarter of 2016, we expect the interest rate increase in December will offset that factor. Also driving net interest income higher was the increase in both loans and securities as well as the material reduction in interest paid on debt. Accordingly, we expect we'll experience similar, if not slightly higher, net interest income in the first quarter of 2016.
On Slide 6, we were encouraged with the results from the initiatives we've made to grow fee income. Managed fee income increased 4% from the 2014 year, and we are targeting a stronger growth rate in 2016. Managed fee income is defined by us as income sources we manage directly and excludes the effect of dividends, securities gains and losses and other similar sources.
The most significant increase in 2015 was from treasury management, which increased 13%. It also happens to be our strongest contributor to total fee income. Some of the headwinds include loan fees, which were down due in part to soft demand for energy lending as well as overdraft fees, which is attributable at least in part to strengthening consumer balance sheets.
On Slide 7, we have the cost savings initiative scorecard graph, with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by the end of 2017; the bar on the right illustrating the cost saves that were accomplished in 2015. We remain on track to achieve the targeted cost reductions by 2017, having already realized more than half of the goal by the end of 2015.
We're encouraged with the achievement of holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion in 2015. Additionally, our commitment is to hold that line item, adjusted for certain restructuring costs, to below $1.6 billion in 2016. We expect benefits in 2016 to include the simplification of operations that are due in part to the charter consolidation.
Moving to Slide 8. We have achieved a portion of another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which was to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below in the second half of 2015. We're encouraged with this achievement, and we are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio in 2016 of 66% or better as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1 of last year.
On Slide 9, we are satisfied with the progress we have made on our technology projects. The general ledger transition and new reporting tool conversion are complete. The credit approval workflow system software is installed in most of our banks, with the completion scheduled for the spring of this year. The same is true for the enterprise loan operations. We're tracking for a spring completion.
Regarding our core systems replacement project, which we've dubbed FutureCore where we've partnered with Tata Consultancy Services, we're expecting the consumer loan system to roll out later this year, with commercial lending tracking for 2017 and the deposits module scheduled for 2018. In summary, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future. These are investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where technology is obviously playing an increasingly important role.
Finally, as noted in the press release, the consolidation of our 7 subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter was completed on December 31. We'll continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brands in each market we serve. But we'll find some additional efficiency from this consolidation of charters. We're very optimistic about the future operational and financial performance for Zions.
With that brief overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $88 million or $0.43 per share. Relative to the third quarter, net interest income increased about 5.5%.
Adjusted for recoveries of interest income and a linked-quarter increase in income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased just under 3%. Actively managed noninterest income, which excludes investment-related items and securities gains and losses, increased slightly from the prior quarter, and as Harris noted earlier, increased about 4% for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014.
At just over $400 million, noninterest expenses were higher in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due in part to elevated levels of expenses in certain categories as detailed in the press release, which accompanied this call. We are encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to realize our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.6 billion for 2015.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. We had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans partially offset by continued reserve release in the rest of the portfolio. Although throughout most of the quarter, we expected the provision for loan losses to be in line with the third quarter results, the decline in the price of oil near the end of the quarter resulted in a moderately higher provision. The energy loan portfolio continued to perform about as we had expected.
As we progress through 2016, we expect quarterly provisions to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter results. The key driver of our expectation for an elevated provision in 2016 is the lower prevailing energy prices. Actual results may therefore vary from expectations if energy prices remain volatile.
Finally, I would like to highlight the return on tangible common equity. Although we are working to drive shareholder returns to a much higher level, I'll point out that our efforts over the past year have resulted in a better than 100 basis point increase in shareholder returns when compared to the same period a year ago, while capital levels have actually increased slightly during the period.
Turning to Slide 11. I'll address some of the drivers of net interest income, beginning with volume. Details of our investment portfolio are shown here on Slide 11. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the past year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the recently established liquidity coverage ratio rules.
Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the fourth quarter, we added $1.5 billion to our investment securities portfolio on average when compared to the third quarter. In light of the general market expectation for rising short-term rates, we are exercising caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivities as we purchase fixed-rate investments and duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio.
The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is estimated to be 2.9 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to about 3.1 years. As expected, the addition of these fixed-rate investments reduce Zions' asset sensitivity somewhat as shown in the table at the bottom right of the page.
Worth noting, the deposit beta assumptions employed in our ""Slowed"" case are, in fact, faster than what we are seeing in the market today, or in plain language, our ""Slow"" scenario model assumes faster deposit repricing than we are currently observing in the market. So the improvement in net interest income from the December rate hike could and likely will be higher than that shown in the table on Slide 11.
On Page 12, we break down year-over-year loan growth. Overall, we are encouraged with our fourth quarter loan growth despite some headwinds, as Harris mentioned earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew at a little over 5% annualized. Net commercial and industrial loan growth for the last year was about 6% when excluding the effect of energy loan attrition. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth without an adverse change in our underwriting standards.
Year-over-year, net churn in commercial real estate growth was about 8% when removing the effect of national real estate portfolio. Residential mortgage continues to be a major focus for growth across our geographic footprint. The other category experienced healthy growth from various subcategories such as home equity and municipal lending.
The 2 portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more are the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio. The national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans, and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point to the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. The rate of decline is slowing for this portfolio, and it currently accounts for less than 50% of tangible common equity.
The energy portfolio attrition is well documented as we have discussed this regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. We expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. To summarize, our outlook on loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which should be in the low to mid-single digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the yield or rates on the portfolio and loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is the loan yield, which increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to average 4.24%. As described in the press release, there was a recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield. Excluding this recovery, the loan yield on the portfolio declined about 2 basis points from the prior quarter.
The securities portfolio yield declined slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the redemption of high-cost subordinated debt. The net interest margin increased to 3.23%, a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter.
If adjusted for the income recovery, the net interest margin would have been about 3.18%. This increase is largely attributable to the change in earning asset mix, more loans and securities in the fourth quarter and less cash as well as the previously mentioned reduction of high-cost subordinated debt.
Slide 14 provides more detail on loan yields, specifically the coupon on new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risk to the future yield on loans in the current interest rate environment. The yellow line reflects the gap yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for this increase is the previously mentioned interest recoveries.
Importantly, the weighted average coupon of the loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon, of course, excludes the effect of amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production also stabilized in the fourth quarter as we saw the yield on larger loans improved somewhat in December, reflective of the move in LIBOR. Although our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the small loan space, our production coupons have been stable.
Turning to credit quality on Slide 15. I'll be brief and say that we continue to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments, with the notable exception of energy-related loans, which are included in our C&I segment. Our reserve for credit loss is quite strong at just under 1.7% of loans, which is nearly 2x our nonperforming assets and over a decade's worth of charge-offs based on the fourth quarter annualized results. Despite an increase in classified energy-related loans of just under -- I'm sorry, just over $76 million from the prior quarter level, overall classified loans increased only $45 million or 3% in the fourth quarter.
Nonperforming assets declined slightly from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined due to recoveries, which were $32 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross charge-offs were relatively stable when compared to the prior quarter. Our outlook for 2016 net charge-offs is between 30 and 35 basis points of average loans. The majority of these charge-offs are expected to be energy-related.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and the Houston market more broadly."

But let me just m",887,"Thank you, Paul, and I'll start on Slide 17. We've not repeated the table that we have in our earnings release on Page 4 of the earnings release in this -- in the main section of this slide deck, although it can be found in the appendix. But let me just make some summary comments.
As noted in the press release, energy loan outstandings and commitments declined fairly substantially from the prior quarter and from a year ago. We commented that we believe this would happen throughout 2015. The decline in outstandings was about $450 million compared to a year ago, and commitments are down approximately $1 billion since a year ago.
Classified energy loan balances increased by approximately $76 million from the prior quarter and finished at a level that is actually somewhat better than what we would have expected a year ago. Nonaccrual energy loans declined from the prior quarter, primarily due to net charge-offs, which is not the way you want to reduce that bucket. But it's important to note that the level did not increase much if you adjust for net charge-offs.
Turning to Slide 16 -- let's see. It's not Slide 16. It's probably Slide 17, yes. Or is it -- sorry, yes. As we noted since late 2014, we have been extremely active in managing the energy portfolio, including the full attention of our entire executive team, reviewing the portfolio frequently on a credit-by-credit basis plus significant interaction with our customers. Based upon that input, along with our models, we are updating our outlook for energy loan losses.
As noted previously, these various methodologies led us to an estimated energy loan -- energy loan losses of between $75 million to $125 million for the 9-quarter period ending the fourth quarter of 2016. That was estimated more than a year ago based upon oil prices near $50. It is obviously considerably -- the price of oil was obviously considerably lower than that today, with most of that decline occurring during December 2015 and January 2016. So it's appropriate to provide an update to that loss expectation.
Assuming $30 per barrel for the next several quarters, we estimate that energy loan losses will be between $75 million and $100 million in 2016. This is on the high end of the initial range, but has been driven by the decline in the oil and gas prices relative to the initial expectation. And as Paul just mentioned, we expect total losses for the company to remain manageable, with net charge-offs ranging between 30 and 35 basis points for the entire consolidated portfolio. We continue to build our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 5%. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations that we've reported in the past and that have been reported by peers.
On Slide 17, we are providing some additional disclosures on trends in the various major types of energy credits, with the orange line representing upstream or exploration and production loans; the green line representing energy services; and the yellow line representing all other energy-related loans.
On the left is the trend in balances outstanding. Despite the capital markets being somewhat quiet in the fourth quarter, we still experienced a substantial decline in balances as borrowers continue to sell assets and use cash flow to reduce debt. On the right -- on the top right is the trend in classified energy loans by subtype, with services increasing during the fourth quarter, while classified E&P companies experienced a decline in that quarter. Nonaccruals are shown at the bottom. We expect continued downgrades but we expect that the situation, as noted before, will be manageable.
On Slide 18, we show an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left-hand side of each bar represents the Houston exposure. The point of this slide really is that the Houston CRE portfolio is diversified across a variety of asset types, product categories, and we are not concentrated in any one particular area, with very minimal exposure to land.
Slide 19 is a new disclosure for us, which shows the commercial real estate portfolio by cash flow and collateral support. You'll notice that there's very little in the way of tail risk. Property values could decline or cash flow could decline substantially, and very few properties would run into substantial trouble.
While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure which are worth mentioning. When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us much more conservatively today. They include, first, that our total commercial real estate balances are approximately $1.2 billion less today than they were going into 2008; and our exposure to land is down more than 80% from what we saw going into the previous cycle.
Additionally, our mix of construction lending and CRE term lending has shifted much more to CRE term. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office and multifamily construction financing is almost double today what it was going into the previous cycle of 2008. With that as a bit of a backdrop, Paul, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans due primarily to factors already discussed earlier in our comments.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect net interest income to increase from the fourth quarter level. We anticipate continued loan and security growth and additional benefit from December's slight rate increase, which will outpace the headwinds of 1 fewer day of interest income and no anticipated large interest income recoveries.
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $100 million for every 100 basis point increase in short-term rates. We expect a quarterly provision that is moderately higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming energy prices remain near current levels. We expect to maintain a strong reserve ratio on energy loans.
We expect the noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on these line items. As a reminder, dividends from federal agencies, namely the Federal Home Loan Banks, will decline due to the charter consolidation. You may recall we had multiple memberships to several Federal Home Loan Banks, and we're consolidating those to a single Federal Home Loan Bank. And due to the FAST Act, which is more commonly known as the highway spending bill and its impact on dividends from the Federal Reserve.
Noninterest expense, as stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expense to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 4 basis points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter related to alternative energy and research and development. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 34% in 2016, which may fluctuate somewhat due to how much of our investment in technology projects is eligible for tax credits.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. The tender offer completed in the fourth quarter reduces preferred dividends by approximately $10 million annually, although the amounts are uneven. For example, assuming no changes to the outstanding preferred equity from today, the first and third quarter dividend rates are expected to be 112 -- or I'm sorry, $12 million each, and the second and fourth quarters should be approximately $15 million each.

Actually, the paydowns are coming much more -- they're more heavily weighted to the services portfolio, number one. Number two, we -- you're going to see a natural contraction in the reserve base outstandings as those -- as the redetermination came down during the quarter, the borrowing bases were redetermined down. We saw some natural payoffs there. And those would be the 2 primary areas. And we saw a continued term amortization. Recall that on the services side of our portfolio, about 35% of the portfolio is term. It's amortizing on a little less than a 5-year basis. And so we're continuing to see reductions there. And then the last comment I would make is that during the year, we had approximately $140 million of capital contributed by private equity firms, and that didn't all go to support reductions. But it -- a portion of it did. And additionally, we saw about $150 million in loan commitments reduced as a result of restructurings that we did. So really, it's across the board, and it's all pretty healthy-type reductions that you would anticipate."

I'm going to talk about some information on the accompanying slides, just some opening comments here. 
On Slide 3, here are some highlights for the quarter. We were pleased with the continued strength of strong increases preprovision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that are in line with our stated expense initiatives. 
Another item that appears to be an emerging trend in the last 6 months is stronger loan growth. In the first quarter, loans increased at an annualized rate of 7.6%, accelerating from the prior quarter's rate of 5.3%. It was one of the best first quarter growth rates Zions has posted in the last decade. 
We achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter. And we are tracking well on the efficiency initiative that we announced last summer, with the efficiency ratio falling to 68.5%. 
Although there will be much discussion about energy lending on this call, which only comprises about 6% of our loan portfolio, the other 94% of our loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well, and energy is a manageable situation for us. Of note, although that earnings per share only increased $0.01 per share over the prior year period, the change in the provision for credit losses between those 2 quarters is equal to about $0.12 per share. So although energy concerns will be with us for 2016, that effect is fairly transitory compared to the improving trend in underlying financial performance over the course of the last year.
If we turn to Slide 4, our preprovision net revenue has improved by 21% over the past year. This positive [ph] operating leverage has been driven by holding adjusted noninterest expense growth to 2.5%, while adjusted revenue has increased nearly 8% over the same period. We expect to continue to post continued strong momentum in this area over the next couple of years.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the fourth quarter, we experienced an acceleration in the first quarter with loans held for investment increasing, as previously noted, 7.6% annualized after posting a healthy 5.3% annualized growth rate in the prior quarter. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth specifically on energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposits declined modestly about 1% from the prior quarter, which is somewhat common for a first quarter for us. And the year-over-year improvement of 3.7% is similar to the performance in first quarters over approximately the last decade.
Moving to Slide 6, we are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 66% or better for the full year 2016. We're encouraged with the improvement from the prior quarter to 68.5% in the first quarter, which included a couple of significant seasonal expense items.
Advancing to Slide 7, including energy loans, credit quality was really solid across the company by various loan types and geographies. Total classified loans increased to 3.7% from 3.4% in the prior quarter and that's -- but aside from energy, classified loans declined slightly to 2% of total loans. Nonperforming assets expressed as a percentage of loans and OREO increased to 1.3% from 0.9% in the prior quarter. However, if one excludes energy credits, nonperforming asset to loan ratio is only 0.7%. 
On the topic of losses, substantially all of the losses in the first quarter were attributable to energy loss. We'll have some further discussion on that later, but the takeaway here is that the energy situation is quite manageable and the overall provision and loss rates remain in line with industry averages.
On Slide 8, this is a repeat of this slide we produced for Investor Day back in February, but it helps to visually show the various initiatives than we are tracking to help improve the operating performance the company. I'm pleased with the progress made in several of these areas in a relatively short period of time, and most initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines.
Similarly, Slide 9 is a summary of the key financial performance metrics that we are targeting, and we feel very good about the progress we've made and expect that with continued discipline, that will meet or exceed these goals. 
that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the first quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.38 per share.  
Relative to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased about $4 million. Adjusted for fourth quarter recoveries of interest income and income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased $17 million or about 4% on a linked quarter basis. Customer related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, were flat to the fourth quarter and improved about 7% from the first quarter of 2015. 
At just less than $400 million, noninterest expense was slightly lower in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. However, there were several notable items impacting both quarters.  First, on salaries and employee benefits, the first quarter included $6 million related to equity grants to retirement-eligible employees and $7 million in seasonal payroll taxes, while the fourth quarter included an incentive compensation accrual reversal of $5 million. Additionally, as noted on the fourth quarter earnings call, fourth quarter noninterest expenses included elevated levels of FDIC loss sharing expense and an elevated legal accrual. 
We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allowed Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expenses at less than $1.6 billion for 2016.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, as we conveyed at February's Investor Day, we increased our allowance for credit losses in the first relative to the fourth quarter, reflective of continued stress in our oil and gas portfolio. As we progress through 2016, we currently expect quarterly provisions to be roughly consistent with first quarter results. A key driver of this outlook is overall market conditions, including the level and volatility of energy prices. Scott will provide more detail on our energy portfolio just a moment.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was about 8.5% -- was up about 8.5% when compared to the first quarter 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was up on an annualized rate of just under 4%.  In controlling for the $13 million of elevated FDIC related revenues and interest income recoveries reported in the fourth quarter of 2015, the linked quarter growth rate was closer to 15%. This recent rate of growth in net interest income while not sustainable over the long term, reflects our focus on improving the profitability of our balance sheet and has been significantly helped by strong loan growth, the movement of cash to high quality liquid investments, the maturities of higher cost wholesale funds and December's federal funds target rate increase. Looking ahead, net interest income is expected to increase throughout 2016 as loan growth and active management of the investment portfolio impacts the size and mix of earning assets. Importantly, our performance objectives assume a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target rate in December of 2016. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates as shown in the box at the bottom right of Slide 11.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the first quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent, high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rules. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in baseline and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. 
During the first quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $1.3 billion on average when compared to the first quarter. This average balanced growth was influenced by the $1.1. billion point-to-point increase in available-for-sale securities as well as the continued impact of purchases we made in the prior quarter. 
We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet sensitivity, interest rate sensitivity, as we purchase fixed-rate investments and with respect to duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio. The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire security's portfolio is about 2.6 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 3.1 years. 
On Page 19, we break down year-over-year loan growth in a slightly different format than we have utilized previously. The size of the bubbles on this chart represent loan portfolio size, while the position against the vertical axis represents year-over-year growth. As shown, Zions is generally growing where we want to grow where owner-occupied C&I and residential mortgage remain opportunities for additional growth. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew 7% on an annualized basis, in particular strength in C&I and term CRE. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth while maintaining our underwriting standards.
There are 4 loan losses that have been in decline for this past year or more. And the most substantial rates of decline are in the national real estate portfolio and energy portfolio, each declining approximately 16% from the prior year-ago period.  The national real estate portfolio represents about 5% of loans. And the attrition here has resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point of the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. We have indicated that we expected the rate of attrition to taper, and it's beginning to happen, recently declining an annualized $276 million as compared to the year-over-year decline of $415 million. On energy, as we move through redetermination on upstream energy credits, we expect paydowns due to reduced borrowing bases.
To summarize, our outlook for loan growth for the next 12 months is for an increasing portfolio, which will be in the mid-single-digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the rate or yields of a portfolio, can be found on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 10 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.14%. As described in the press release, the prior quarter had a recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield as well as elevated income from FDIC-supported loans. Excluding these 2 factors, the yield on the loan portfolio increased somewhat from the prior quarter lifted by the increase in benchmark rates. However, older loans booked at wider spreads are regularly maturing and continue to place pressure on loan yields. 
The securities portfolio yield improved slightly this quarter, largely due the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk as well as the increase in rates that affected our floating-rate securities. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and was stable relative to prior quarter. 
The net interest margin increased to 3.35% in the first quarter, a 12 basis point increase from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the ongoing shift in earning asset composition to a higher concentration of loans and securities and a lower concentration of cash.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss our fee income initiative as well as provide additional detail about our energy portfolio. Scott?"

Because of the seasonality of the results, we think the year-over-year comparison is more relevant. Through the hard work of our employees, we were able to increase customer related fee income by 7% over the year-ago period. These results have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of the expense associated with rewards programs, such as cash back, from the noninterest expense category to net against card revenue, which was done to align our accounting approach to be more comparable to the majority of banks within the industry. 
The areas experiencing the most significant growth in fee -- and customer fees included loan fees, which increased nearly $4 million or 38% from the year-ago period to equal $14 million in the first quarter 2016. Bankcard fees increased more than $2 million or 17% to equal nearly $18 million. Treasury management is our largest category of customer fee income, which increased 3% from the year-ago period to equal about $35 million. Relative to the prior quarter, we experienced an increase in dividends, although there was a valuation adjustment to one of our investments that adversely affected dividends by about $2 million.
Transitioning to energy now, obviously energy is of significant concern to many investors. And it's all an hands-on-deck effort here at Zions to do as much as possible, obviously to protect the value of principal and interest of our loans and at the same time, demonstrating our long-term commitment to our customers.
Before we dive into the numbers though, let me first address something that is the subject of much discussion on the earnings conference calls of other banks with energy exposure, the Shared National Credit exam results. As you know, this is a regulatory exam and is subject to disclosure restrictions. We have incorporated the vast majority of the results of the Shared National Credit exam in our first quarter results. And if we incorporate all of the results, the financial results of the quarter would not be materially different. 
Our grading methodology has been and continues to be consistent with regulatory guidance. As you know, -- as you may know, the Shared National Credit Program is not final. Some grades of loans where we are a participant bank are in their appeal period. Obviously, we downgrade credits based upon the Shared National Credit results where applicable. But in the Shared National Credit results are better than our internal grade, we leave the internal grade in place. So as investors looking at our financial condition, you are getting a very conservative view of the portfolio.
Let me move now to Slide 16. As you can see, our energy loan outstandings -- and also from the material in the press release increased $21 million from the prior quarter, with declines in the services portfolio, offset by some new underwriting in upstream, midstream and downstream, and a handful of defensive draws. Of course, energy loan commitments and balances are down substantially from year-ago period, and we do expect further attrition as we move through the borrowing base redetermination process. We are about 40% through the spring redetermination, and we anticipate the average borrowing base of a client to decline by about 12% to 15% relative to the fall redetermination. 
Also on Slide 16, as you can see on the right side of the slide and the chart on Page 4 of the press release, classified energy loan balances increased by $194 million from the prior quarter to equal 27% of outstanding balances. And nonaccrual loans increased by $220 million from the prior quarter to equal 10.8% of loan balances. The increase in both categories was evenly weighted between upstream loans and services, loans to energy services companies. The primary driver of these increases had to do with the severity of the commodity price volatility early in the quarter, a flattening of the Nymex strip and a continued uncertain outlook.
Turning to Slide 17, we are displaying some new information here to help investors better understand the nature of our unfunded oil and gas commitments. We have just under $400 million of unfunded loan commitments in the criticized category or just under 20% of total commitments. However, and this is very important, about 1/2 of that $400 million is unavailable to the borrower for various reasons, including borrowing base restrictions, covenant breaches or antihoarding provisions. During the quarter, we experienced 6 loans that did drop on on their lines equaling about $55 million of balances. Again, not something we are happy to see, but it is manageable. And as a senior secured lender, we feel good about our loss severity in the event that there is a default on any of these loans.
Moving on to Slide 18, it may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of our criticized and classified energy loans and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their payments. Only 9% of nonaccrual loans are past due.
Moving to Slide 19, as we all know in the first quarter, there was significant oil and gas price volatility. This volatility, combined with continuing credit-by-credit review and our top fund regression models, is leading us to update our outlook for energy loan losses. More specifically, if oil were to hover in the mid-$30s area, we currently expect losses in 2016 to be in the $100 million area. Recall our prior outlook was for a range of $75 million to $100 million for the year. Clearly, prices today are above the mid-$30 range level, however, we always want to be prepared for lower prices. During the second quarter, we will be closely monitoring the results of the spring reserve base redetermination and the actions being taken by our private equity sponsors to better inform our full year energy loss outlook.
We continue to build our energy loss reserve to a level of $214 million or more than 8% of energy balances. this is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations. 
I'm sure we'll have questions about energy lending, but let me step back and look at the objectives we're working towards is a company.  
On Slide 20, this is summary several items we articulated at our recent Investor Day. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage. And I think at this point with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we -- than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well against these goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns of capital, it is premature to discuss capital returns opportunities as we are awaiting the results of the 2016 CCAR. However, we aspire to have a much higher return of capital than experienced in the recent past.
Finally, we're absolutely committed our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really as a strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank in the United States. And we are only one of 4 banks and have performed an industry-leading levels since of this -- since the initiation of this survey.
Paul, with that, I'll turn the call back over you to conclude."

Slide 22 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are adjusting our loan outlook to increasing due primarily to factors already discussed in earlier comments. We expect net interest income to increase from the first quarter level as continued growth of loans and investment securities offset possible pressure on loan pricing. 
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $75 million to $135 million for each 100 basis point increase in rates. That's particularly focused on the short end of the curve. 
We expect a quarterly provision for loan and lease losses in 2016 that is roughly consistent with the provision taken in the first quarter of 2016, assuming current market conditions. This incorporates the maintenance of a strong reserve ratio on energy loans, although we expect energy loan balances to continue the declining trend.
We expect the noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. As stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring expenses. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than the normal quarterly run rate, which was facilitated in part from the consolidation of our banking charters. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% for the full year in 2016.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. As noted last quarter, the preferred tender completed in the 4Q will reduce preferred dividends by approximately $10 million in 2016 versus 2015. I expect that you have noticed the preferred tender announced today along with this earnings release. This action, if successful, is expected to reduce our run rate preferred dividends to an annual level of roughly $45 million.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Abigail, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

And so that has somewhat of an effect on effective rent and NOI, but most of our properties are absorbing quite nicely. And office, there is some risk there, but the loan sizes are not significant. And the underwriting is very solid with 50% to 55% loan to cost on some of the construction loans, where they were done on a little bit of a speculative basis and we have great sponsors there. And so we have quite a bit of comfort. If we see migration in the CRE book, it will mostly be in the vast grade ranges that may be a few outliers that go to criticized."

So we don't believe our office exposure is going to be material, although we do have exposure there. I would just say also that if you have to look at our CRE exposure in Texas relative to what we had in 2008, we have about $1 billion less total CRE exposure today than we had in 2008. We have significantly pivoted from construction lending to CRE term there. And you can see that in our numbers, we have no land A and B, and we have close to $1 billion of it going into the '08 downturn. That was principally because when you did construction loans, that you generally finance Phase 2 and Phase 3 land.

There a lot of reasons for that. And so we feel pretty confident that oilfield service will be under considerable stress for the remainder of this year and a fair amount of next year."

So that was part of that allowance for credit losses and overall portfolio balance. And then we -- the reserve for loans, excluding the energy loan portfolio which is $2.6 billion. But excluding that, we do have a reserve to loan ratio of about 1.2% on that book of business. And that would compare to now net charge-offs in the quarter on that portfolio, and I would also compare it to about 70 basis points of nonaccrual loans. So it's really pretty strong reserve relative to the current credit quality positioning of that. And it's just continue to get better and better, so there's not as much support as there was 2 or 3 years ago for keeping that reserve level higher."

I'm going to talk about some information on the accompanying slides, just some opening comments here. 
On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in preprovision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that are in line with our stated expense initiatives. 
Another item that appears to be an emerging trend in the last 6 months is stronger loan growth. In the first quarter, loans increased at an annualized rate of 7.6%, accelerating from the prior quarter's rate of 5.3%. It was one of the best first quarter growth rates Zions has posted in the last decade. 
We achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and we are tracking well on the efficiency initiative that we announced last summer, with the efficiency ratio falling to 68.5%. 
Although there will be much discussion about energy lending on this call, which only comprises about 6% of our loan portfolio, the other 94% of our loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well, and energy is a manageable situation for us. Of note, although that earnings per share only increased $0.01 per share over the prior year period, the change in the provision for credit losses between those 2 quarters is equal to about $0.12 per share. So although energy concerns will be with us for 2016, that effect is fairly transitory compared to the improving trend in underlying financial performance over the course of the last year.
If we turn to Slide 4, our preprovision net revenue has improved by 21% over the past year. This positive operating leverage has been driven by holding adjusted noninterest expense growth of 2.5%, while adjusted revenue has increased nearly 8% over the same period. We expect to continue to post continued strong momentum in this area over the next couple of years.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the fourth quarter, we experienced an acceleration in the first quarter with loans held for investment increasing, as previously noted, 7.6% annualized after posting a healthy 5.3% annualized growth rate in the prior quarter. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically on energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposits declined modestly about 1% from the prior quarter, which is somewhat common for a first quarter for us. And the year-over-year improvement of 3.7% is similar to the performance in first quarters over approximately the last decade.
Moving to Slide 6, we are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 66% or better for the full year 2016. We're encouraged with the improvement from the prior quarter to 68.5% in the first quarter, which included a couple of significant seasonal expense items.
Advancing to Slide 7, excluding energy loans, credit quality is really solid across the company by various loan types and geographies. Total classified loans increased to 3.7% from 3.4% in the prior quarter and that's -- but aside from energy, classified loans declined slightly to 2% of total loans. Nonperforming assets expressed as a percentage of loans and OREO increased to 1.3% from 0.9% in the prior quarter. However, if one excludes energy credits, the nonperforming asset to loan ratio is only 0.7%. 
On the topic of losses, substantially all of the losses in the first quarter were attributable to energy loans. We'll have some further discussion on that later, but the takeaway here is that the energy situation is quite manageable and the overall provision and loss rates remain in line with industry averages.
On Slide 8, this is a repeat of the slide we produced for Investor Day back in February, but it helps to visually show the various initiatives that we are tracking to help improve the operating performance of the company. I'm pleased with the progress made in several of these areas in a relatively short period of time, and most initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines.
Similarly, Slide 9 is a summary of the key financial performance metrics that we are targeting, and we feel very good about the progress we've made and expect that with continued discipline, that we'll meet or exceed these goals. 
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the first quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.38 per share.  
Relative to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased about $4 million. Adjusted for fourth quarter recoveries of interest income and income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased $17 million or about 4% on a linked quarter basis. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, were flat to the fourth quarter and improved about 7% from the first quarter of 2015. 
At just less than $400 million, noninterest expense was slightly lower in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. However, there were several notable items impacting both quarters. First, on salaries and employee benefits, the first quarter included $6 million related to equity grants to retirement-eligible employees and $7 million in seasonal payroll taxes, while the fourth quarter included an incentive compensation accrual reversal of $5 million. Additionally, as noted on the fourth quarter earnings call, fourth quarter noninterest expenses included elevated levels of FDIC loss sharing expense and an elevated legal accrual. 
We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allowed Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expenses at less than $1.6 billion for 2016.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, as we conveyed at February's Investor Day, we increased our allowance for credit losses in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, reflective of continued stress in our oil and gas portfolio. As we progress through 2016, we currently expect quarterly provisions to be roughly consistent with first quarter results. A key driver of this outlook is overall market conditions, including the level and volatility of energy prices. Scott will provide more detail on our energy portfolio in just a moment.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was about 8.5% -- was up about 8.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was up on an annualized rate of just under 4%. In controlling for the $13 million of elevated FDIC-related revenues and interest income recoveries reported in the fourth quarter of 2015, the linked quarter growth rate is closer to 15%. This recent rate of growth in net interest income, while not sustainable over the long term, reflects our focus on improving the profitability of our balance sheet and has been significantly helped by strong loan growth, the movement of cash, the high-quality liquid investments, the maturities of higher cost wholesale funds and December's federal funds target rate increase. Looking ahead, net interest income is expected to increase throughout 2016 as loan growth and active management of the investment portfolio impact the size and mix of earning assets. Importantly, our performance objectives assume a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target rate in December of 2016. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates as shown in the box at the bottom right of Slide 11.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the first quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent, high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rules. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in baseline and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. 
During the first quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $1.3 billion on average when compared to the fourth quarter. This average balanced growth was influenced by the $1.1 billion point-to-point increase in available-for-sale securities as well as the continued impact of purchases we made in the prior quarter. 
We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet sensitivity, interest rate sensitivity, as we purchase fixed-rate investments and with respect to duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio. The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire security's portfolio is about 2.6 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 3.1 years. 
On Page 13, we break down year-over-year loan growth in a slightly different format than we have utilized previously. The size of the bubbles on this chart represent loan portfolio size, while the position against the vertical axis represents year-over-year growth. As shown, Zions is generally growing where we want to grow where owner-occupied C&I and residential mortgage remain opportunities for additional growth. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew 7% on an annualized basis, with particular strength in C&I and term CRE. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth while maintaining our underwriting standards.
There are 4 loan classes that have been in decline for this past year or more. And the most substantial rates of decline are in the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio, each declining approximately 16% from the prior year-ago period. The national real estate portfolio represents about 5% of loans. And the attrition here has resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point of the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. We have indicated that we expected the rate of attrition to taper, and that is beginning to happen, recently declining an annualized $276 million as compared to the year-over-year decline of $415 million. On energy, as we move through the spring redetermination on upstream energy credits, we expect paydowns due to reduced borrowing bases.
To summarize, our outlook for loan growth for the next 12 months is for an increasing portfolio, which would be in the mid-single-digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the rate or yields of the portfolio, can be found on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 10 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.14%. As described in the press release, the prior quarter container recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield as well as elevated income from FDIC-supported loans. Excluding these 2 factors, the yield on the loan portfolio increased somewhat from the prior quarter, lifted by the increase in benchmark rates. However, older loans that were booked at wider spreads are regularly maturing and continued to place slight pressure on loan yields. 
The securities portfolio yield improved slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk as well as the increase in rates that affected our floating-rate securities. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and was stable relative to the prior quarter. 
The net interest margin increased to 3.35% in the first quarter, a 12 basis point increase from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the ongoing shift in earning asset composition to a higher concentration of loans and securities and a lower concentration of cash.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss our fee income initiative as well as provide additional detail about our energy portfolio. Scott?"

Because of the seasonality of the results, we think the year-over-year comparison is more relevant. Through the hard work of our employees, we were able to increase customer-related fee income by 7% over the year-ago period. These results have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of the expense associated with rewards programs, such as cash back, from the noninterest expense category to net against our card revenue, which was done to align our accounting approach to be more comparable to the majority of banks within the industry. 
The areas experiencing the most significant growth in fee -- in customer fees included loan fees, which increased nearly $4 million or 38% from the year-ago period to equal $14 million in the first quarter of 2016. Bank card fees increased more than $2 million or 17% to equal nearly $18 million. Treasury management is our largest category of customer-related fee income, which increased 3% from the year-ago period to equal about $35 million. Relative to the prior quarter, we experienced an increase in dividends, although there was a valuation adjustment to one of our investments that adversely affected dividends by about $2 million.
Transitioning to energy now, obviously, energy is of significant concern to many investors. And it's all a hands-on-deck effort here at Zions to do as much as possible, obviously to protect the value of both the principal and interest of our loans and at the same time demonstrating our long-term commitment to our customers.
Before we dive into the numbers though, let me first address something that is the subject of much discussion on the earnings conference calls of other banks with energy exposure, the shared national credit exam results. As you know, this is a regulatory exam and is subject to disclosure restrictions. We have incorporated the vast majority of the results of the shared national credit exam in our first quarter results. And if we'd incorporated all of the results, the financial results of the quarter would not be materially different. 
Our grading methodology has been and continues to be consistent with regulatory guidance. As you know -- as you may know, the shared national credit exam is not final. Some grades of loans where we are a participant bank are in their appeal period. Obviously, we downgrade credits based upon the shared national credit results where applicable. But if the shared national credit results are better than our internal grade, we leave the internal grade in place. So as investors looking at our financial condition, you are getting a very conservative view of the portfolio.
Let me move now to Slide 16. As you can see, our energy loan outstandings, and also from the material in the press, increased $21 million from the prior quarter, with declines in the services portfolio, offset by some new underwriting in upstream, midstream and downstream, and a handful of defensive draws. Of course, energy loan commitments and balances are down substantially from a year-ago period, and we do expect further attrition as we move through the borrowing base redetermination process. We are about 40% through the spring redetermination, and we anticipate the average borrowing base of a client to decline by about 12% to 15% relative to the fall redetermination. 
Also, on Slide 16, as you can see on the right side of the slide and the chart on Page 4 of the press release, classified energy loan balances increased by $194 million from the prior quarter to equal 27% of outstanding balances. And nonaccrual loans increased by $220 million from the prior quarter to equal 10.8% of loan balances. The increase in both categories was evenly weighted between upstream loans and services, loans to energy services companies. The primary driver of these increases had to do with the severity of the commodity price volatility early in the quarter, a flattening of the NYMEX strip and a continued uncertain outlook.
Turning to Slide 17. We are displaying some new information here to help investors better understand the nature of our unfunded oil and gas commitments. We have just under $400 million of unfunded loan commitments in the criticized category or just under 20% of total commitments. However, and this is very important, about 1/2 of that $400 million is unavailable to the borrower for various reasons, including borrowing base restrictions, covenant breaches or antihoarding provisions. During the quarter, we experienced 6 loans that did drop on their lines equaling about $55 million of balances. Again, not something we're happy to see, but it is manageable. And as a senior secured lender, we feel good about our loss severity in the event that there is a default on any of these loans.
Moving on to Slide 18. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of our criticized and classified energy loans and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their payments. Only 9% of nonaccrual loans are past due.
Moving to Slide 19. As we all know in the first quarter, there was significant oil and gas price volatility. This volatility, combined with continuing rigorous credit-by-credit review and our top-down regression models, is leading us to update our outlook for energy loan losses. More specifically, if oil were to hover in the mid-$30s area, we currently expect losses in 2016 to be in the $100 million area. Recall our prior outlook was for a range of $75 million to $100 million for the year. Clearly, prices today are above the mid-$30 range level, however, we always want to be prepared for lower prices. During the second quarter, we will be closely monitoring the results of the spring reserve base redetermination and the actions being taken by our private equity sponsors to better inform our full year energy loss outlook.
We continue to build our energy loss reserve to a level of $214 million or more than 8% of energy balances. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations. 
I'm sure we'll have questions about energy lending, but let me step back and look at the objectives we're working towards as a company.  
On Slide 20, this is summary of several items we articulated at our recent Investor Day. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage. And I think at this point with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we -- than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well against these goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns of capital, it is premature to discuss capital returns opportunities as we are awaiting the results of the 2016 CCAR. However, we aspire to have a much higher return of capital than experienced in the recent past.
Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really as a strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank in the United States. And we are only one of 4 banks that have performed at industry-leading levels since this -- since the initiation of this survey.
Paul, with that, I'll turn the call back over to you to conclude."

Slide 22 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are adjusting our loan outlook to increasing due primarily to factors already discussed in earlier comments. We expect net interest income to increase from the first quarter level as continued growth of loans and investment securities offset possible pressure on loan pricing. 
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to annual net interest income of about $75 million to $135 million for each 100 basis point increase in rates. That's particularly focused on the short end of the curve. 
We expect a quarterly provision for loan and lease losses in 2016 that is roughly consistent with the provision taken in the first quarter of 2016, assuming current market conditions. This incorporates the maintenance of a strong reserve ratio on energy loans, although we expect energy loan balances to continue their declining trend.
We expect that noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. As stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring expenses. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than the normal quarterly run rate, which was facilitated in part from the consolidation of our banking charters. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% for the full year of 2016.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. As noted last quarter, the preferred tender completed in the fourth quarter will reduce preferred dividends by approximately $10 million in 2016 versus 2015. I expect that you have noticed the preferred tender announced today along with this earnings release. This action, if successful, is expected to reduce our run rate preferred dividends to an annual level of roughly $45 million.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Abigail, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

And so that has somewhat of an effect on net effective rents and NOI, but most of our properties are absorbing quite nicely. And office, there is some risk there, but the loan sizes are not significant. And the underwriting is very solid with 50% to 55% loan to cost on some of the construction loans, where they were done on a little bit of a speculative basis, and we have great sponsors there. And so we have quite a bit of comfort. If we see migration in the CRE book, it will mostly be in the past grade ranges of with maybe a few outliers that go to criticized."

So we don't believe our office exposure is going to be material, although we do have exposure there. I would just comment also that if you really have to look at our CRE exposure in Texas relative to what we had in 2008, we have about $1 billion less in total CRE exposure today than we had in 2008. We have significantly pivoted from construction lending to CRE term there. And you can see that in our numbers. We have virtually no land A and B, and we had close to $1 billion of it going into the '08 downturn. That was principally because when you did construction loans, then you generally finance Phase 2 and Phase 3 land. And then the final point is that -- we -- the amount of equity that has gone into office, multifamily particularly, is almost double what it was in the cycle leading up to 2008.

There are a lot of countervailing things here. Obviously, the Federal Reserve rate increase helped us. But I would ask you to remember and as we disclosed on our Investor Day, we provided some incremental disclosures around kind of the sensitivity of earning assets to changes in rates. And one of the things I would point out is that, we continue to have some level of loans, particularly prime-based loans that are floored. And so they -- for example, because they are at floor rate, would not have enjoyed the kind of the dollar-for-dollar, basis point-for-basis point increase with the Fed. And so that -- and we've also got some swaps on the books. So those things combined with, I would say, continued pricing pressure kind of led to that overall net yield improvement."

So that was part of that allowance for credit losses and overall portfolio balance. And then we -- the reserve for loans, excluding the energy loan portfolio which is $2.6 billion, but excluding that, we'd have a reserve to loan ratio of about 1.2% on that book of business.

I'm going to talk about some information on the accompanying slides, just some opening comments here. 
On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in preprovision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that are in line with our stated expense initiatives. 
Another item that appears to be an emerging trend in the last 6 months is stronger loan growth. In the first quarter, loans increased at an annualized rate of 7.6%, accelerating from the prior quarter's rate of 5.3%. It was one of the best first quarter growth rates Zions has posted in the last decade. 
We achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and we are tracking well on the efficiency initiative that we announced last summer, with the efficiency ratio falling to 68.5%. 
Although there will be much discussion about energy lending on this call, which only comprises about 6% of our loan portfolio, the other 94% of our loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well, and energy is a manageable situation for us. Of note, although that earnings per share only increased $0.01 per share over the prior year period, the change in the provision for credit losses between those 2 quarters is equal to about $0.12 per share. So although energy concerns will be with us for 2016, that effect is fairly transitory compared to the improving trend in underlying financial performance over the course of the last year.
If we turn to Slide 4, our preprovision net revenue has improved by 21% over the past year. This positive operating leverage has been driven by holding adjusted noninterest expense growth of 2.5%, while adjusted revenue has increased nearly 8% over the same period. We expect to continue to post continued strong momentum in this area over the next couple of years.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the fourth quarter, we experienced an acceleration in the first quarter with loans held for investment increasing, as previously noted, 7.6% annualized after posting a healthy 5.3% annualized growth rate in the prior quarter. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically on energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Deposits declined modestly about 1% from the prior quarter, which is somewhat common for a first quarter for us. And the year-over-year improvement of 3.7% is similar to the performance in first quarters over approximately the last decade.
Moving to Slide 6, we are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 66% or better for the full year 2016. We're encouraged with the improvement from the prior quarter to 68.5% in the first quarter, which included a couple of significant seasonal expense items.
Advancing to Slide 7, excluding energy loans, credit quality is really solid across the company by various loan types and geographies. Total classified loans increased to 3.7% from 3.4% in the prior quarter and that's -- but aside from energy, classified loans declined slightly to 2% of total loans. Nonperforming assets expressed as a percentage of loans and OREO increased to 1.3% from 0.9% in the prior quarter. However, if one excludes energy credits, the nonperforming asset to loan ratio is only 0.7%. 
On the topic of losses, substantially all of the losses in the first quarter were attributable to energy loans. We'll have some further discussion on that later, but the takeaway here is that the energy situation is quite manageable and the overall provision and loss rates remain in line with industry averages.
On Slide 8, this is a repeat of the slide we produced for our Investor Day back in February, but it helps to visually show the various initiatives that we are tracking to help improve the operating performance of the company. I'm pleased with the progress made in several of these areas in a relatively short period of time, and most initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines.
Similarly, Slide 9 is a summary of the key financial performance metrics that we are targeting, and we feel very good about the progress we've made and expect that with continued discipline, that we'll meet or exceed these goals. 
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the first quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.38 per share.  
Relative to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased about $4 million. Adjusted for fourth quarter recoveries of interest income and income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased $17 million or about 4% on a linked quarter basis. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, were flat to the fourth quarter and improved about 7% from the first quarter of 2015. 
At just less than $400 million, noninterest expense was slightly lower in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. However, there were several notable items impacting both quarters. First, on salaries and employee benefits, the first quarter included $6 million related to equity grants to retirement-eligible employees and $7 million in seasonal payroll taxes, while the fourth quarter included an incentive compensation accrual reversal of $5 million. Additionally, as noted on the fourth quarter earnings call, fourth quarter noninterest expenses included elevated levels of FDIC loss sharing expense and an elevated legal accrual. 
We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allowed Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expenses at less than $1.6 billion for 2016.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, as we conveyed at February's Investor Day, we increased our allowance for credit losses in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, reflective of continued stress in our oil and gas portfolio. As we progress through 2016, we currently expect quarterly provisions to be roughly consistent with first quarter results. A key driver of this outlook is overall market conditions, including the level and volatility of energy prices. Scott will provide more detail on our energy portfolio in just a moment.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was about 8.5% -- was up about 8.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was up at an annualized rate of just under 4%. In controlling for the $13 million of elevated FDIC-related revenues and interest income recoveries reported in the fourth quarter of 2015, the linked quarter growth rate was closer to 15%. This recent rate of growth in net interest income, while not sustainable over the long term, reflects our focus on improving the profitability of our balance sheet and has been significantly helped by strong loan growth, the movement of cash, the high-quality liquid investments, the maturities of higher cost wholesale funds and December's federal funds target rate increase. Looking ahead, net interest income is expected to increase throughout 2016 as loan growth and active management of the investment portfolio impact the size and mix of earning assets. Importantly, our performance objectives assume a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target rate in December of 2016. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates as shown in the box at the bottom right of Slide 11.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the first quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent, high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rules. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in baseline and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. 
During the first quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $1.3 billion on average when compared to the fourth quarter. This average balanced growth was influenced by the $1.1 billion point-to-point increase in available-for-sale securities as well as the continued impact of purchases we made in the prior quarter. 
We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet sensitivity -- interest rate sensitivity, as we purchase fixed-rate investments and with respect to duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio. The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over 3 years. The duration of the entire security's portfolio is about 2.6 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 3.1 years. 
On Page 13, we break down year-over-year loan growth in a slightly different format than we have utilized previously. The size of the bubbles on this chart represent loan portfolio size, while the position against the vertical axis represents year-over-year growth. As shown, Zions is generally growing where we want to grow while owner-occupied C&I and residential mortgage remain opportunities for additional growth. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew 7% on an annualized basis, with particular strength in C&I and term CRE. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth while maintaining our underwriting standards.
There are 4 loan classes that have been in decline for this past year or more. And the most substantial rates of decline are in the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio, each declining approximately 16% from the prior year-ago period. The national real estate portfolio represents about 5% of loans. And the attrition here has resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point of the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. We have indicated that we expected the rate of attrition to taper, and that is beginning to happen, recently declining an annualized $276 million as compared to the year-over-year decline of $415 million. On energy, as we move through the spring redetermination on upstream energy credits, we expect paydowns due to reduced borrowing bases.
To summarize, our outlook for loan growth for the next 12 months is for an increasing portfolio, which would be in the mid-single-digit rate of growth range.
Another key component of net interest income, which is the rate or yields of the portfolio, can be found on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 10 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.14%. As described in the press release, the prior quarter contained a recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield as well as elevated income from FDIC-supported loans. Excluding these 2 factors, the yield on the loan portfolio increased somewhat from the prior quarter, lifted by the increase in benchmark rates. However, older loans that were booked at wider spreads are regularly maturing and continued to place slight pressure on loan yields. 
The securities portfolio yield improved slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk as well as the increase in rates that affected our floating-rate securities. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and was stable relative to the prior quarter. 
The net interest margin increased to 3.35% in the first quarter, a 12 basis point increase from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the ongoing shift in earning asset composition to a higher concentration of loans and securities and a lower concentration of cash.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss our fee income initiative as well as provide additional detail about our energy portfolio. Scott?"

Because of the seasonality of the results, we think the year-over-year comparison is more relevant. Through the hard work of our employees, we were able to increase customer-related fee income by 7% over the year-ago period. These results have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of the expense associated with rewards programs, such as cash back, from the noninterest expense category to net against our card revenue, which was done to align our accounting approach to be more comparable to the majority of banks within the industry. 
The areas experiencing the most significant growth in fee -- in customer fees included loan fees, which increased nearly $4 million or 38% from the year-ago period to equal $14 million in the first quarter of 2016. Bank card fees increased more than $2 million or 17% to equal nearly $18 million. Treasury management is our largest category of customer-related fee income, which increased 3% from the year-ago period to equal about $35 million. Relative to the prior quarter, we experienced an increase in dividends, although there was a valuation adjustment to one of our investments that adversely affected dividends by about $2 million.
Transitioning to energy now, obviously energy is of significant concern to many investors. And it's an all-hands-on-deck effort here at Zions to do as much as possible, obviously to protect the value of both the principal and interest of our loans and at the same time demonstrating our long-term commitment to our customers.
Before we dive into the numbers though, let me first address something that is the subject of much discussion on the earnings conference calls of other banks with energy exposure, the shared national credit exam results. As you know, this is a regulatory exam and is subject to disclosure restrictions. We have incorporated the vast majority of the results of the shared national credit exam in our first quarter results. And if we'd incorporated all of the results, the financial results of the quarter would not be materially different. 
Our grading methodology has been and continues to be consistent with regulatory guidance. As you know -- as you may know, the shared national credit exam is not final. Some grades of loans where we are a participant bank are in their appeal period. Obviously, we downgrade credits based upon the shared national credit results where applicable. But if the shared national credit results are better than our internal grade, we leave the internal grade in place. So as investors looking at our financial condition, you are getting a very conservative view of the portfolio.
Let me move now to Slide 16. As you can see, our energy loan outstandings, and also from the material in the press release, increased $21 million from the prior quarter, with declines in the services portfolio, offset by some new underwriting in upstream, midstream and downstream, and a handful of defensive draws. Of course, energy loan commitments and balances are down substantially from a year-ago period, and we do expect further attrition as we move through the borrowing base redetermination process. We are about 40% through the spring redetermination, and we anticipate the average borrowing base of a client to decline by about 12% to 15% relative to the fall redetermination. 
Also, on Slide 16, as you can see on the right side of the slide and the chart on Page 4 of the press release, classified energy loan balances increased by $194 million from the prior quarter to equal 27% of outstanding balances. And nonaccrual loans increased by $220 million from the prior quarter to equal 10.8% of loan balances. The increase in both categories was evenly weighted between upstream loans and services, loans to energy services companies. The primary driver of these increases had to do with the severity of the commodity price volatility early in the quarter, a flattening of the NYMEX strip and a continued uncertain outlook.
Turning to Slide 17. We are displaying some new information here to help investors better understand the nature of our unfunded oil and gas commitments. We have just under $400 million of unfunded loan commitments in the criticized category or just under 20% of total commitments. However, and this is very important, about 1/2 of that $400 million is unavailable to the borrower for various reasons, including borrowing base restrictions, covenant breaches or anti-hoarding provisions. During the quarter, we experienced 6 loans that did draw upon their lines equaling about $55 million of balances. Again, not something we're happy to see, but it is manageable. And as a senior secured lender, we feel good about our loss severity in the event that there is a default on any of these loans.
Moving on to Slide 18. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of our criticized and classified energy loans and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their payments. Only 9% of nonaccrual loans are past due.
Moving to Slide 19. As we all know in the first quarter, there was significant oil and gas price volatility. This volatility, combined with continuing rigorous credit-by-credit review and our top-down regression models, is leading us to update our outlook for energy loan losses. More specifically, if oil were to hover in the mid-$30s area, we currently expect losses in 2016 to be in the $100 million area. Recall our prior outlook was for a range of $75 million to $100 million for the year. Clearly, prices today are above the mid-$30 range level, however, we always want to be prepared for lower prices. During the second quarter, we will be closely monitoring the results of the spring reserve base redetermination and the actions being taken by our private equity sponsors to better inform our full year energy loss outlook.
We continue to build our energy loss reserve to a level of $214 million or more than 8% of energy balances. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations. 
I'm sure we'll have questions about energy lending, but let me step back and look at the objectives we're working towards as a company.  
On Slide 20, this is a summary of several items we articulated at our recent Investor Day. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage. And I think at this point with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we -- than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well against these goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns of capital, it is premature to discuss capital returns opportunities as we are awaiting the results of the 2016 CCAR. However, we aspire to have a much higher return of capital than experienced in the recent past.
Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really as a strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank in the United States.

Slide 22 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are adjusting our loan outlook to increasing due primarily to factors already discussed in earlier comments. We expect net interest income to increase from the first quarter level as continued growth of loans and investment securities offset possible pressure on loan pricing. 
Our outlook does not include the effect of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect a benefit to an annual net interest income of about $75 million to $135 million for each 100 basis point increase in rates. That's particularly focused on the short end of the curve. 
We expect a quarterly provision for loan and lease losses in 2016 that is roughly consistent with the provision taken in the first quarter of 2016, assuming current market conditions. This incorporates the maintenance of a strong reserve ratio on energy loans, although we expect energy loan balances to continue their declining trend.
We expect that noninterest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. As stated previously, we are committed to holding noninterest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring expenses. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than the normal quarterly run rate, which was facilitated in part from the consolidation of our banking charters. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% for the full year of 2016.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. As noted last quarter, the preferred tender completed in the fourth quarter will reduce preferred dividends by approximately $10 million in 2016 versus 2015. I expect that you have noticed the preferred tender announced today along with this earnings release. This action, if successful, is expected to reduce our run rate preferred dividends to an annual level of roughly $45 million.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Abigail, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

I would just comment also that you really have to look at our CRE exposure in Texas relative to what we had in 2008, we have about $1 billion less in total CRE exposure today than we had in 2008. We have significantly pivoted from construction lending to CRE term there. And you can see that in our numbers. We have virtually no land A and B, and we had close to $1 billion of it going into the '08 downturn. That was principally because when you did construction loans, then you generally finance Phase 2 and Phase 3 land. And then the final point is that -- we -- the amount of equity that has gone into office, multifamily particularly is almost double what it was in the cycle leading up to 2008.

By",1014,"Thank you very much, James, and welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results.
On Slide 3 for some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily to adjust for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago, and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter.
We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in preprovision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that were well controlled and that remained within the parameters of our stated expense initiatives.
Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%. We also experienced improved loan growth. For the second quarter, loans increased 2.6% prior quarter, so it was a quarter for loan growth.
Credit quality is a little bit of the tale of 2 cities. We consistently try to very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolio through this energy cycle. It remains challenged and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later.
Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So when you get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we are actually really, really pleased with the quality that we're seeing there.
Turning to Slide 4, our adjusted preprovision net revenue has improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck but the major exclusion of the effect of securities gains and losses. We have been -- and we've been successful in improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth and adjusted preprovision growth revenue. Although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loan sales from investment increasing 2.6% as previously noted. Deposit balance has increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits.
On Slide 6, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although we've experienced strong growth in terms of commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect nonenergy commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth to be the primary driver for loan growth over the next few quarters.
We continue to expect a decline in the national real estate portfolio that we discussed on prior occasions. I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters, so while we're particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. We are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio in less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted year-to-date, efficiency ratio is 66.5%; quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit loan assistance, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us once we complete these projects over the next 2 or 3 years.
On Slide 8 is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in the number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of these major initiatives are tracking on targeted budgets and time lines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.
My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted designs loan quality is measured by net loan losses has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On Slide 9, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio but with our strong reserve, we presently expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses of the next year, a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company as noted and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consist of nonenergy loans, and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last 5 quarters has a medium -- a median of only 1 basis point annualized. Nonperforming assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and the nonenergy classified loans declined and 90-plus day delinquency also declined. So some good metrics there.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burgess to review the financial results. Paul?"

I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second part of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest i",1545,"Thank you, Harris and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second part of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015.
At $382 million, noninterest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year ago quarter. Although the year ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016 for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our noninterest expense commitment.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. At our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next 4 quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast. Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors and improved capital market activity in that industry. However, because we remain cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintained the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserves. The resulting reserves, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding. Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked-quarter increase was due to several various factors, most of the increase was due to strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of this might. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate characteristics of those assets combined with continued deposit growth have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assumed 1 additional 25 basis point -- funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was priced again about a 50% -- 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of liquidity coverage ratio rules. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million on average when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio.
The mortgage-backed securities we are adding a relatively short in duration, right around 3 years, with duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year if rates increased by 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating-rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our model estimates that duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years. A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise. Thus, in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio and the loan production, can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key composite of our net interest margin. Top line is the loan yield, which expanded 2 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.16%, and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or repriced during the quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter largely due to increased premium amortization, which was in turn due to higher prepayment rates. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets, which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investments resulted in a 4 basis point increase in the net interest margin this quarter. Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio, as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than 5 basis points in the near term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities. 
Over the longer term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth. Although most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced, the overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin but a continued increase in net interest income.
Turning to Slide 14 and noninterest income. Because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%; wealth management, which was up 9%; and mortgage, up 16%. Notably in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loans held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific need to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.
Noninterest expense on Slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year and is adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck. The decline was 2.6% from the year ago period. Although I will note that about half of that improvement is due the timing of stock-based compensation, which we have had discussed previously.
For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted noninterest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know in the first quarter, we incur seasonal expenses, which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million, stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million and payroll taxes declined $4 million when we observe the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next 4 quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to a lower level in order to align the capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

On Slide 17, we show on the left side as well as of the slide, the oil and gas those broken down by upstream, services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan out dialing balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter with declines principally in upstream and services -- in the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio.
Parenthetically, you will note on Slide 22, that energy loan commitments declined more than that $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year.
Looking at the problem loan metrics again on Slide 17 for the oil and gas portfolio, classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million drink the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in quarter 1, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstanding. Also of note, and easier to see on Slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1.
Finally, nonaccrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their contractual payments.
On Slide 18, regarding our loss expectations. If oil were to hold in mid-40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we flagged as high risk for loss already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have approved our outlook and energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers, sponsors suggests that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices.
Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.
If you turn to Slide 19, this is the last of our key objectives and our commitments in our fundamental commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage we described. And I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt, enhance digital capabilities and many additional advantages. Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.
Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our returns of capital to shareholders. Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with local communities bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only one of four banks that have performed at industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately 8 years ago.
Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced. Although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong, we are going to remain disciplined in our concentration of risk management avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio. Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although our efficiency target includes the assumption of 1 additional quarter point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.
We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments, to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.
We expect that customer related noninterest income, which includes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track towards our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.
For the next 4 quarters, we expect noninterest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of '17 as is seen in the first quarter of '16. The effective tax rate for the second quarter return to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter, we recognized a one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months.

I guess I would say clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress testing the model to think about risk, particularly in a downturn to inform how we think about capital. And there are a lot of things that we have dealt the risk management-wise here in the last 5 or 6 to 7 years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes, I think we would agree that we've got more capital. We're at the north end of where our peers are. I would note that we'll always going to be probably kind of to the strong side so long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. I mean, we know that those are both segments where you could see maybe a little more cyclicality among other things. And so as you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a raise to the bottom,  if you will, in terms of rating your capital.

What is your ultimate goal, what is your ultimate goal relatively speaking with regard to ROEs to get it into the -- how are you going to get it into the 10% to 12% range?"

There is some additional reduction in preferred that would help, I mean, cost of cost of preferred is a drag to the ROE. I would expect as we continue to see better results, through CCAR that we'll be a little bit more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask. And then there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think is really important focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at preprovision net revenue, there's operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters, it takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference. And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, I mean, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that -- I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision as we said earlier. As we come off the other end, I think we're short of real deterioration, kind of significant deterioration than the rest of the economy, the other credit metrics around -- absolute reserves are strong. And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have ROEs is going to be provision when we get to the energy cycle that is likely to be pretty low and will also help with our ROE while we continue build this operating leverage that I'm talking about."

The other thing I would note, we don't comment on it enough but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined end of January, February, the first part of March and then both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because recall that in our reserve base lending activity about 50% of the reserve is -- I mean of the borrowing bases natural gas reserves. So you really have to focus on both. But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid to high 30s. And the sensitivity would've been down in the low -- in the high 20s, excuse me, high 20s to 30-ish. And so prices were treated here back to the high 30s. I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low 30s, high 20s well, then, it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment. Because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since 6 months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes. So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve base portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve base side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just on oilfield service question fundamentally and how long that will go on. And we believe that will go on into next year even with -- even if prices continue to improve."

The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit us both Harris and Paul noted in their comment, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs.  And clearly, our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through the 6 months. And we are clearly going to have less charge-offs than we anticipated there. So we continue to anticipate the same consolidated net charge-off experience that we've guided to.

Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By",1022,"Thank you very much, James, and welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results.
On Slide 3 for some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily to adjust for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago, and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter.
We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that were well controlled and that remained within the parameters of our stated expense initiatives.
Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%. We also experienced improved loan growth. And the second quarter loans increased 2.6% from the prior quarter. So it was a good quarter for loan growth.
Credit quality is a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. We consistently tried to be very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolio through this energy cycle. It remains challenged, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later.
Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So you get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we are actually really, really pleased with the quality that we're seeing there.
Turning to Slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue has improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck, with the major exclusion of the effect of securities gains and losses. We have been -- and we've been successful at improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth and adjusted pre-provision net revenue, although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loan sales from investment increasing 2.6%, as previously noted. Deposit balance has increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits.
On Slide 6, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although we've experienced strong growth in termed commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect nonenergy commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth to be the primary drivers of loan growth over the next few quarters.
We continue to expect a decline in the national real estate portfolio that we discussed on prior occasions. I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters. So while we're particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. We are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio at less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted, year-to-date, the efficiency ratio is 66.5%; quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit loan assistance, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us, once we complete these projects over the next 2 or 3 years.
On Slide 8 is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in a number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of these major initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.
My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted the Zions' loan quality is measured by net loan losses that has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On Slide 9, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio, but with our strong reserve, we presently expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses over the next year at a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company, as noted, and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consist of nonenergy loans, and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last 5 quarters has a medium -- a median of only 1 basis point, annualized. Nonperforming assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and the nonenergy classified loans declined and 90-plus day delinquency has also declined. So some good metrics there.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burgess to review the financial results. Paul?"

Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest",1539,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second part of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015.
At $382 million, noninterest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Although the year-ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation, which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016 for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our noninterest expense commitment.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. At our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next 4 quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast. Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors and improved capital markets activity in that industry. However, because we remain cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintained the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserve. The resulting reserve, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding. Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked-quarter increase was due to several various factors. Most of the increase was due to the strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of both the assets, combined with continued deposit growth, have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25-basis-point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assumed 1 additional 25-basis-point federal funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was priced again about a 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million on average when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in that investment portfolio.
The mortgage-backed securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, right around 3 years, with duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year, if rates increased by 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating-rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our model estimates that duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years. A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise, thus, in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. Top line is the loan yield, which expanded 2 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.16%, and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or repriced during the quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter largely due to increased premium amortization, which was in turn due to higher prepayment rates. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets, which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points, and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investments resulted in a 4-basis-point increase in the net interest margin this quarter. Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than 5 basis points in the near term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities. 
Over the longer term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth, although most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced. The overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin, but a continued increase in net interest income.
Turning to Slide 14, and noninterest income. Because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%; wealth management, which was up 9%; and mortgage up 16%. Notably, in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loan held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific gain to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.
Noninterest expense on Slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance that displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck, the decline was 2.6% from the year-ago period. Although I will note that about half of that improvement is due to the timing of stock-based compensation, which we have had discussed previously.
For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted noninterest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know, in the first quarter, we incurred seasonal expenses, which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million, stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million and payroll taxes declined $4 million, when we observe the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next 4 quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to a lower level in order to align a capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

On Slide 17, we show on the left side of the slide, the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter, with declines principally in upstream and services -- and the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio.
Parenthetically, you will note on Slide 22, that energy loan commitments declined more than $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year.
Looking at the problem loan metrics again on Slide 17 for the oil and gas portfolio, classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million during the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in the -- in quarter 1, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstanding. Also of note, and easier to see on Slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1.
Finally, nonaccrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their contractual payment.
On Slide 18, regarding our loss expectations, if oil were to hold in the mid-40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we've flagged as high risk for loss already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have improved our outlook on energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers and sponsors suggest that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices.
Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this a very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.
If you turn to Slide 19, this is the last of our key objectives and our commitments and our fundamental commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving the positive operating leverage we described. And I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt, enhance digital capabilities and maybe -- and many additional advantages. Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.
Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our return of capital to shareholders. Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with local communities bank approach. Perhaps, the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only one of four banks that have performed at the industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately 8 years ago.
Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced. Although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong, we are going to remain disciplined in our concentration of risk management, avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio. Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although our efficiency target includes the assumption of one additional quarter point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.
We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments, to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.
We expect that customer-related noninterest income, which includes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.
For the next 4 quarters, we expect noninterest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of '17, as was seen in the first quarter of '16. The effective tax rate for the second quarter returned to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter, we've recognized a one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months.
We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. With the successful tender completed in the second quarter, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $45 million over the next 12 months.

But your posing a hypothetical. I guess I would say, clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress testing the model to think about risk, particularly in a downturn to inform how we think about capital. And there are a lot of things that we have dealt the risk management-wise here in the last 5 or 6 or 7 years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes, I think we would agree that we've got more capital. And we're at the north end of where our peers are. I would note that we'll always want to be probably kind of to the strong side, as long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. I mean, we know that those are both segments where you could see maybe a little more cyclicality among other things. And so as you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a raise to the bottom, if you will, in terms of rating your capital. But we want to kind of thoughtfully try to rightsize our capital and to grow into it. And I think we've got -- it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can do. I don't know, I hope that's helpful. I -- I'm -- we know that we have more preferred than we probably need right now.

I would expect as we continue to see better results through CCAR that we'll be able to be a little more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask. And then, there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think it's really important to focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at pre-provision net revenue, there's operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters. It takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference. And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, I mean, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that -- I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision, as we said earlier. As we come off the other end, I think we're short of real deterioration -- significant deterioration than the rest of the economy. The other credit metrics around here are very strong. Our absolute reserves are strong. And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have is that we'll feed into ROEs, going to be a provision when we get through the energy cycle, but it's likely to be pretty low and will also help with our ROE while we continue build this operating leverage that I'm talking about."

The other thing I would note, we don't comment about it enough, but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined kind of January, February and the first part of March, and then both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because recall that in our reserve-based lending activity, about 50% of the reserve is -- I mean, of the borrowing bases, are natural gas reserves. So you really have to focus on both. But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid- to high 30s. And the sensitivity would've been down in the low -- in the high 20s, excuse me, high 20s to 30-ish. And so prices were treated here back to the high 30s. I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low 30s, high 20s, well then, it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment. Because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since 6 months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes. So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve base portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination, all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve base side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just an oilfield service question fundamentally and how long that will go on. And we believe that it will go on into next year, even with -- even if prices continue to improve."

And the result of that, obviously, is no increase in earning assets, the denominator, but an increase in net interest income. So net-net, that's helpful to the margin.

The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit -- as both Harris and Paul noted in their comment, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs.  And clearly, our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought, but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through 6 months. And we are clearly going to have less charge-offs than we anticipated there. So we continue to anticipate the same consolidated net charge-off experience that we've guided to.

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By u",1020,"Thank you very much, James, and welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results. On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily to adjust for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago, and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter. We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that were well controlled and that remain within the parameters of our stated expense initiatives.
Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%. We also experienced improved loan growth. The second quarter loans increased 2.6% from the prior quarter. So it was a good quarter for loan growth.
Credit quality is a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. We consistently tried to be very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolio through this energy cycle. It remains challenged, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later. Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So we get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we're actually really, really pleased with the quality that we're seeing there.
Turning to Slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue has improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck, with the major exclusion of the effect of securities gains and losses. We have been -- and we've been successful at improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth and adjusted pre-provision net revenue, although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loans held for investment increasing 2.6%, as previously noted. Deposit balance has increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits.
On Slide 6, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although we've experienced strong growth in termed commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect nonenergy, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth to be the primary drivers of loan growth over the next few quarters.
We continue to expect a decline in the national real estate portfolio that we discussed on prior occasions. I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters. So while we're particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. We are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio at less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted, year-to-date, the efficiency ratio is 66.5%; quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit loan systems, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us, once we complete these projects over the next 2 or 3 years.
On Slide 8 is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in a number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of the major initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.
My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted the Zions' loan quality is measured by net loan losses that has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On Slide 9, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio, but with our strong reserve, we presently expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses over the next year at a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company, as noted, and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consist of nonenergy loans, and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last 5 quarters has a medium -- a median of only 1 basis point annualized Nonperforming assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and the nonenergy classified loans declined and 90-plus day delinquency has also declined. So some good metrics there.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burgess to review the financial results. Paul?"

For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015. At $382 million, noninterest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Although the year-ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation, which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016 for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our noninterest expense commitment.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. At our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next 4 quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast. Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors and improved capital markets activity in that industry. However, because we remain cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintain the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserve. The resulting reserve, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding. Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked-quarter increase was due to several various factors. Most of the increase was due to the strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities. 
We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of both the assets, combined with continued deposit growth, have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25-basis-point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assume 1 additional 25-basis-point federal funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was priced again about a 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million on average when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in that investment portfolio.
The mortgage-backed securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, right around 3 years, with duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year, if rates increase by 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating-rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our model estimates that duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years. A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise, thus, in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. Top line is the loan yield, which expanded 2 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.16%, and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or repriced during the quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter largely due to increased premium amortization, which was in turn due to higher prepayment rates. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. 
At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets, which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points, and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investments resulted in a 4-basis-point increase in the net interest margin this quarter. Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than 5 basis points in the near term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities.  Over the longer term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth, although most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced. The overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin, but a continued increase in net interest income.
Turning to Slide 14, and noninterest income. Because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%; wealth management, which was up 9%; and mortgage up 16%. Notably, in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loan held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific gain to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.
Noninterest expense on Slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck, the decline was 2.6% from the year-ago period. Although I will note that about half of that improvement is due to the timing of stock-based compensation, which we have had discussed previously. For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted noninterest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know, in the first quarter, we incurred seasonal expenses, which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million, stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million and payroll taxes declined $4 million, when we observe the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next 4 quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to a lower level in order to align the capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

On Slide 17, we show on the left side of the slide, the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter, with declines principally in upstream and services -- and the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio. Parenthetically, you will note on Slide 22, that energy loan commitments declined more than $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year.
Looking at the problem loan metrics again on Slide 17 for the oil and gas portfolio. Classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million during the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in the -- in quarter 1, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstanding. Also of note, and easier to see on Slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1. Finally, nonaccrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their contractual payment.
On Slide 18, regarding our loss expectations. If oil were to hold in the mid-40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we've flagged as high risk for loss already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have improved our outlook on energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers and sponsors suggest that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices. Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this a very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.
If you turn to Slide 19, this is the last of our key objectives and our commitments -- and our fundamental commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving the positive operating leverage we described. And I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages. Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.
Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our return of capital to shareholders. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with local communities, with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only 1 of 4 banks that have performed at the industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately 8 years ago.
Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced. Although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong, we are going to remain disciplined in our concentration of risk management, avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio. Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although our efficiency target includes the assumption of one additional quarter point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.
We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments, to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions. We expect that customer-related noninterest income, which includes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.
For the next 4 quarters, we expect noninterest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of '17, as was seen in the first quarter of '16. The effective tax rate for the second quarter returned to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter, we recognized a one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. With the successful tender completed in the second quarter, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $45 million over the next 12 months.

But you're posing a hypothetical. I guess I would say, clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress testing the model to think about risk, particularly in a downturn to inform how we think about capital. And there are a lot of things that we have dealt the risk management-wise here in the last 5 or 6 or 7 years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes, I think we would agree that we've got more capital. And we're at the north end of where our peers are. I would note that we'll always want to be probably kind of to the strong side, so long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. I mean, we know that those are both segments where you could see maybe a little more cyclicality among other things. And so if you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a race to the bottom, if you will, in terms of rating capital. But we want to kind of thoughtfully try to rightsize our capital and to grow into it. And I think we've got -- it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can do. I don't know, I hope that's helpful. I'm -- we know that we have more preferred than we probably need right now. That's something we've talked about and we continue to opportunistically deal with.

I would expect as we continue to see better results through CCAR that we'll be able to be a little more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask. And then, there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think it's really important to focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at pre-provision net revenue, there's operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters. It takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference. And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, I mean, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that -- I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision, as we said earlier. As we come off the other end, I think we're short of real deterioration -- significant deterioration than the rest of the economy. The other credit metrics around here are very strong. Our absolute reserves are strong. And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have is that we'll feed into ROEs, going to be a provision when we get through the energy cycle, but it's likely to be pretty low and will also help with ROE while we continue build this operating leverage that I'm talking about."

The other thing I would note, we don't comment about it enough, but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined kind of January, February and the first part of March, and both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because recall that in our reserve-based lending activity, about 50% of the reserve is -- I mean, of the borrowing bases are natural gas reserves. So you really have to focus on both. But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid- to high 30s. And the sensitivity would've been down in the low -- in the high 20s, excuse me, high 20s to 30-ish. And so prices were treated here back to the high 30s. I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low 30s, high 20s, well then, it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment. Because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since 6 months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes. So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve base portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination, all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve base side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just an oilfield service question fundamentally and how long that will go on. And we believe that it'll go on into next year, even with -- even if prices continue to improve."

And the result of that, obviously, is no increase in earning assets, the denominator, but an increase in net interest income. So net-net, that's helpful to the margin. So as I tried to say in prepared remarks, we're looking at maybe a couple of basis points, we think, over the next couple of quarters. But as you know, as an experienced observer of banks, that can be pretty hard to predict sometimes."

We can see about half of them and then we're assuming others will materialize. So there is an opportunity for a favorable performance relative to the $125 million. The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit -- as both Harris and Paul noted in their comment, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs.  And clearly, our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought, but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through 6 months. And we are clearly going to have less charge-offs than we anticipated there. So we continue to anticipate the same consolidated net charge-off experience that we've guided to. It's just going to be a little more weighted to energy."

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By u",1020,"Thank you very much, James, and welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results. On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily to adjust for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago, and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter. We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that were well controlled and that remain within the parameters of our stated expense initiatives.
Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%. We also experienced improved loan growth. The second quarter loans increased 2.6% from the prior quarter. So it was a good quarter for loan growth.
Credit quality is a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. We consistently tried to be very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolio through this energy cycle. It remains challenged, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later. Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So we get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we're actually really, really pleased with the quality that we're seeing there.
Turning to Slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue has improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck, with the major exclusion of the effect of securities gains and losses. We have been -- and we've been successful at improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth and adjusted pre-provision net revenue, although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loans held for investment increasing 2.6%, as previously noted. Deposit balance has increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits.
On Slide 6, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although we've experienced strong growth in termed commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect nonenergy, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth to be the primary drivers of loan growth over the next few quarters.
We continue to expect a decline in the national real estate portfolio that we discussed on prior occasions. I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters. So while we're particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. We are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio at less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted, year-to-date, the efficiency ratio is 66.5%; quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit loan systems, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us, once we complete these projects over the next 2 or 3 years.
On Slide 8 is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in a number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of the major initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.
My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted the Zions' loan quality is measured by net loan losses that has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On Slide 9, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio, but with our strong reserve, we presently expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses over the next year at a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company, as noted, and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consist of nonenergy loans, and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last 5 quarters has a medium -- a median of only 1 basis point annualized Nonperforming assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and the nonenergy classified loans declined and 90-plus day delinquency has also declined. So some good metrics there.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burgess to review the financial results. Paul?"

Relative to the second quarter of last year, net intere",1540,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015. At $382 million, noninterest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Although the year-ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation, which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016 for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our noninterest expense commitment.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. At our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next 4 quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast. Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors and improved capital markets activity in that industry. However, because we remain cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintain the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserve. The resulting reserve, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding. Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked-quarter increase was due to several various factors. Most of the increase was due to the strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities. 
We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of both the assets, combined with continued deposit growth, have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25-basis-point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assume 1 additional 25-basis-point federal funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was priced again about a 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million on average when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in that investment portfolio.
The mortgage-backed securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, right around 3 years, with duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year, if rates increase by 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating-rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our model estimates that duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years. A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise, thus, in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. Top line is the loan yield, which expanded 2 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.16%, and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or repriced during the quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter largely due to increased premium amortization, which was in turn due to higher prepayment rates. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. 
At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets, which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points, and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investments resulted in a 4-basis-point increase in the net interest margin this quarter. Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than 5 basis points in the near term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities.  Over the longer term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth, although most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced. The overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin, but a continued increase in net interest income.
Turning to Slide 14, and noninterest income. Because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%; wealth management, which was up 9%; and mortgage up 16%. Notably, in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loan held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific gain to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.
Noninterest expense on Slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck, the decline was 2.6% from the year-ago period. Although I will note that about half of that improvement is due to the timing of stock-based compensation, which we have had discussed previously. For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted noninterest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know, in the first quarter, we incurred seasonal expenses, which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million, stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million and payroll taxes declined $4 million, when we observe the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next 4 quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to a lower level in order to align the capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

On Slide 17, we show on the left side of the slide, the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter, with declines principally in upstream and services -- and the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio. Parenthetically, you will note on Slide 22, that energy loan commitments declined more than $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year.
Looking at the problem loan metrics again on Slide 17 for the oil and gas portfolio. Classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million during the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in the -- in quarter 1, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstanding. Also of note, and easier to see on Slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1. Finally, nonaccrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their contractual payment.
On Slide 18, regarding our loss expectations. If oil were to hold in the mid-40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we've flagged as high risk for loss already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have improved our outlook on energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers and sponsors suggest that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices. Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this a very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.
If you turn to Slide 19, this is the last of our key objectives and our commitments -- and our fundamental commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving the positive operating leverage we described. And I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages. Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.
Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our return of capital to shareholders. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with local communities, with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only 1 of 4 banks that have performed at the industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately 8 years ago.
Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced. Although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong, we are going to remain disciplined in our concentration of risk management, avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio. Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although our efficiency target includes the assumption of one additional quarter point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.
We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments, to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions. We expect that customer-related noninterest income, which includes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.
For the next 4 quarters, we expect noninterest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of '17, as was seen in the first quarter of '16. The effective tax rate for the second quarter returned to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter, we recognized a one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. With the successful tender completed in the second quarter, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $45 million over the next 12 months.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Esther, would you please open the line for questions?"

But you're posing a hypothetical. I guess I would say, clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress testing the model to think about risk, particularly in a downturn to inform how we think about capital. And there are a lot of things that we have dealt the risk management-wise here in the last 5 or 6 or 7 years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes, I think we would agree that we've got more capital. And we're at the north end of where our peers are. I would note that we'll always want to be probably kind of to the strong side, so long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. I mean, we know that those are both segments where you could see maybe a little more cyclicality among other things. And so if you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a race to the bottom, if you will, in terms of rating capital. But we want to kind of thoughtfully try to rightsize our capital and to grow into it. And I think we've got -- it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can do. I don't know, I hope that's helpful. I'm -- we know that we have more preferred than we probably need right now. That's something we've talked about and we continue to opportunistically deal with.

I would expect as we continue to see better results through CCAR that we'll be able to be a little more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask. And then, there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think it's really important to focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at pre-provision net revenue, there's operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters. It takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference. And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, I mean, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that -- I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision, as we said earlier. As we come off the other end, I think we're short of real deterioration -- significant deterioration than the rest of the economy. The other credit metrics around here are very strong. Our absolute reserves are strong. And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have is that we'll feed into ROEs, going to be a provision when we get through the energy cycle, but it's likely to be pretty low and will also help with ROE while we continue build this operating leverage that I'm talking about."

The other thing I would note, we don't comment about it enough, but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined kind of January, February and the first part of March, and both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because recall that in our reserve-based lending activity, about 50% of the reserve is -- I mean, of the borrowing bases are natural gas reserves. So you really have to focus on both. But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid- to high 30s. And the sensitivity would've been down in the low -- in the high 20s, excuse me, high 20s to 30-ish. And so prices were treated here back to the high 30s. I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low 30s, high 20s, well then, it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment. Because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since 6 months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes. So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve base portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination, all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve base side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just an oilfield service question fundamentally and how long that will go on. And we believe that it'll go on into next year, even with -- even if prices continue to improve."

The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit -- as both Harris and Paul noted in their comment, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs.  And clearly, our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought, but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through 6 months.

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.57 from $0.41 per share in the year-ago quarter by using the same adjustments we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjust for securities portfolio gains. In this case, earnings per share increased 26% over the prior year third quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.
If you go to Slide 4, we're on track with all of the targets we outlined in our June 2015 efficiency announcement. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce expenses. For example, the number of total full-time equivalent employees was down 251 or about 2.5% at the end of September from where it was a year ago. And revenue growth also remains a primary focus to drive earnings growth.
On Slide 5, we're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of both solid net interest income growth, which increased 10.7% over the past year, and a 10.3% improvement in adjusted noninterest income, with the primary adjustment again being the elimination of securities gains. And as noted, we're also focused on maintaining expenses at a level that we expect to be essentially flat to the back end of last year.
Turning to Slide 6. We posted an efficiency ratio of 66% in the third quarter and are at 66.3% for the year-to-date number. Recall our goal for 2016 is to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66% while maintaining adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion. Although not shown on this page, I'll point out that adjusted noninterest expense was above the target rate in the third quarter, which is largely attributable to several items that we expect to not recur in the fourth quarter. Paul Burdiss will review this a little later in his prepared remarks. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects.
Moving to Slide 7. We experienced soft loan growth in the third quarter, which we largely expected when we discussed the prior quarter results back in July and then highlighted during the quarter at a conference appearance. We weren't alone as the industry generally experienced tepid growth. For Zions, the primary reasons for the linked-quarter softness in loan growth were twofold: first, oil and gas loan balances declined more than $250 million in the third quarter; and secondly, we are, as we've noted, being quite conservative on commercial real estate lending. And in fact, we had more than $450 million less in new commercial real estate originations this past quarter as compared to the prior 2-quarter average.
In the third quarter, we experienced stronger growth in consumer loans, which were up 2.3% relative to the prior quarter-end and 10% over the prior year. Overall, over the past year, we experienced what we feel to be an acceptable 6% growth in loans and 4% growth in deposits. Prudent loan growth is among our top priorities, and some of the steps we're taking to help ensure that growth include finding ways to accelerate the time required to move loan applications through the approval and funding process and adding additional mortgage loan originators and loading additional resources in a couple of our specialty lending areas.
Moving to Slide 8. As a general comment, we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle. And we don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall, credit quality metrics were relatively consistent with those we recorded in the prior quarter, with a moderate increase in nonperforming assets but a decline in both gross and net loan charge-offs.
Slide 8 looks at the credit quality indicators of the non-oil and gas portfolio. In the third quarter, we experienced net loan recoveries of $11 million, bringing the year-to-date figure to a net recovery of $10 million on a portfolio of about $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans.
On Slide 9, you can see that with regard to the oil and gas lending portfolio, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally, although we do not expect -- although we do expect the oilfield services portfolio to weigh on credit quality for a while longer.
We that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $117 million or $0.57 per share.
Harris has just discussed the increases in 2 key revenue line items, and I'll talk a bit more about expenses shortly. But before we leave this page, I'd like to highlight 2 key areas: first, return on assets have increased to 84 basis points, up from 69 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased to 7.9% from 6.1% in the year-ago period. We are committed to increasing these measures of balance sheet return and profitability, and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement.
Let me take -- make a few comments about our revenue. About 3/4 of our revenue comes from net interest income, driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer-related funding. Slide 11 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios.
We remain encouraged with growth in the areas that are targeted for growth, although we certainly would have liked to see more growth in the third quarter, especially in C&I. As we mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward. And indeed, in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, CRE loans increased at an annualized rate of just less than 5%, which is slower than the 11% rate of increase relative to the year-ago period.
Total originations in CRE declined more than 30% from the prior 2-quarter average or more than $450 fewer dollars originated. We expect non-oil and gas commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate portfolio and the oil and gas portfolio.
Slide 12 outlines the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 10.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by $2.5 billion of growth in average loans and $4.6 billion of growth in the investment portfolio.
While we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide, we have developed a -- deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of which, when combined with continued growth of customer deposits, have resulted in a somewhat less asset-sensitive position than has been the case in recent years. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point short-term rate increase would produce between $25 million and $30 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the Zion composition of balance sheet.
It will take a few quarters for the impact of any short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized as only half -- about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR prime. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assumed 1 additional 25 basis point Fed funds target rate increase in December of 2016.
Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the third quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position and in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and to better balance the company's risk return profile.
During the third quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased to net $872 million when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about 4 years, with the duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating rate SBA securities, is about 2.8 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of investment portfolio and loan production, can be seen on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.11%. Some of that compression was attributable to a decline in income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. The remainder was primarily due to reduced fee income that was amortized on commercial loan as the weighted average coupon of the portfolio declined only 1 basis point when compared to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped again this quarter, similar to the move in the prior quarter, which was primarily due to increased premium amortization.
Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income. Total noninterest income increased $145 million from $126 million in the year-ago period. Customer-related fees, as stated in the slide and in the press release, increased to $125 million from $113 million a year ago. The notable areas experiencing significant growth include mortgage, treasury management and wealth management. Within customer-related fees, there were about $3 million of income that came from a variety of items that are unlikely to reoccur in our opinion.
Outside of customer-related fees, approximately $11 million of the income in noninterest income was attributable to the strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in our small business investment company portfolio. We would not expect that income to recur in future quarters.
Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased 3.1% from the prior year. And if adjusted for items such as severance, as displayed in our GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back, the increase was closer to 5.6% from the year-ago period. However, as noted on the slide, there were a few items that caused the results to be elevated, which we do not necessarily expect to recur in future quarters. Some of these items include, for example, an adjustment to our health care and benefits cost, which is about $5 million, impacting the salaries and employee benefits line item. Some of this was related to elevated -- an elevated level of lump-sum pension distributions, and as you know, this is where employees choose to withdraw their pension benefits all at once.
There was an adjustment to professional services cost of about $2 million related to further enhancements in our risk modeling. There was a linked-quarter increase of about $8.5 million in the amount set aside for legal settlements and judgment. And some of the elevated expense was partially offset by a lower accrual for executive compensation, which impacted the salary and benefit line.
In summary, when you add the pluses and minuses, the total noninterest expense line item was a few million dollars higher than what we believe is the typical quarterly run rate. We remain confident in achieving our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion of adjusted noninterest expense for 2016. As we said in our February Investor Day, if we cannot achieve this goal through reducing inefficiencies within the company, we will reduce executive compensation.
Finally on Slide 17, we have increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share per quarter. Additionally, we began executing on our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million between July 2016 and June 2017. We expect to maintain a relatively strong capital ratio, but we do believe the company is overcapitalized relative to its risk profile, and the buyback plan should be helpful in keeping that overcapitalized position from strengthening further.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

Well, let me start with just a high-level commentary on the oil and gas portfolio, and that is that we remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen strong equity injections into the companies during the third quarter, and borrower and sponsor sentiment has certainly improved in many of the segments.
However, at the same time, we continue to experience difficult challenges in the oilfield services portfolio that we believe will continue well into next year. On balance, we think the impact to earnings from oil and gas problem credits over the next several quarters will be substantially less than what we've been experiencing over the last year or so simply because over the last 2 years, we've been building the reserve against the oil and gas portfolio and charge-offs were ramping up. And over the next year or more, we expect the charge-offs will be tapering down, and we are in the early innings of seeing reserve releases.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect oil and gas net charge-offs to trend downward somewhat from the last 12 months, reflecting our continued cautious optimism. And we expect that we'll experience a gradual release of the oil and gas allowance for credit losses over the coming quarters.
On Slide 18, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other, which is essentially the mid- and downstream portfolio, primarily centered in midstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased $256 million from the prior quarter. This was probably the greatest decline in energy outstandings we've seen in any quarter today.
Additionally, we're seeing a fairly large number of favorable resolutions each quarter. Over the last 6 months, approximately $625 million of criticized balances were resolved through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades, which is nearly 80% of the beginning balance. The biggest decline came from the services portfolio, which declined more than $130 million, and about $100 million of which was favorable resolutions.
Looking at the problem loan metrics of the oil and gas portfolio. Classified oil and gas loan balances decreased $44 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, a much improved performance compared to the prior quarter's deterioration. Total nonaccrual balances increased, with all of the increase coming from the services portfolio. As I've noted in the past, the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on payments.
Turning to Slide 19 regarding our loss expectations. Assuming oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher and natural gas similarly positioned favorably as well, we expect energy losses for the next 4 quarters to be somewhat less than in the past year and that most of those losses will come from the services portfolio.
The third quarter losses reflect the results also of the shared national credit exam, both in terms of our loan quality and charge-off metrics that we've reported. Although the losses remain elevated, we have a strong reserve set aside against our oil and gas loans. The reserve is more than $200 million, which represents more than 8% of outstanding balances.
On Slide 20 is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth in pre-provision -- in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan deposit customer information infrastructure in the United States.
When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers and improve our new product time-to-market, position us well to more aggressively adopt the enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals, as discussed earlier. Regarding return of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders.
Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the industry leading results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research.
With that, Paul, I'll turn the call back to you."

I'll draw your attention to Slide 22, which depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the sort of mid-single digits.
We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. Although our efficiency target looking forward into 2017 include the assumption of 1 additional quarter rate point hike in December, we believe we can achieve our targeted growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target Fed funds rate.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of just over $15 million this quarter, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitment. This was assisted by various net recoveries outside of the oil and gas portfolio. We do not believe that is a sustainable level, and thus, we believe the provision for credit losses will likely be more consistent with the level that we experienced in the first half of 2016, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.
We expect the customer-related fees, which we define as our -- which we define in our press release and which exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, will be stable from the level reported in the third quarter, which had been noted on the slide to include about $3 million of miscellaneous income that we don't consider likely to recur, at least on a sustainable basis.
We remain committed to achieving our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016, which implies about $395 million or less in the fourth quarter. In the first half of 2017, we expect to experience a typical seasonal variation, as was seen in the first half of 2016, with most of that variation occurring in the first quarter.
Although we are striving to keep expenses low and stable, the outlook for the next 4 quarters is consistent with the initial goal outlined in June 2015, which called for a slight increase in 2017 relative to 2016. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% over the next 4 quarters, and we expect preferred dividends to be between $40 million and $45 million over the next 12 months. And as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher-cost preferred equity, although we do not expect that to have a material benefit to the forward 4-quarter outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Candice, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

At the -- when we come out the other end of this, which is still -- it's kind of 3 years away, but I do expect that's going to create a much simpler back office in this place.

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.57 from $0.41 per share in the year-ago quarter by using the same adjustments we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjust for securities portfolio gains. In this case, earnings per share increased 26% over the prior year third quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.
If you go to Slide 4, we're on track with all of the targets we outlined in our June 2015 efficiency announcement. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce expenses. For example, the number of total full-time equivalent employees was down 251 or about 2.5% at the end of September from where it was a year ago. And revenue growth also remains a primary focus to drive earnings growth.
On Slide 5, we're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of both solid net interest income growth, which increased 10.7% over the past year, and a 10.3% improvement in adjusted noninterest income, with the primary adjustment again being the elimination of securities gains. And as noted, we're also focused on maintaining expenses at a level that we expect to be essentially flat to the back end of last year.
Turning to Slide 6. We posted an efficiency ratio of 66% in the third quarter and are at 66.3% for the year-to-date number. Recall our goal for 2016 is to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66% while maintaining adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion. Although not shown on this page, I'll point out that adjusted noninterest expense was above the target rate in the third quarter, which is largely attributable to several items that we expect to not recur in the fourth quarter. Paul Burdiss will review this a little later in his prepared remarks. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects.
Moving to Slide 7. We experienced soft loan growth in the third quarter, which we largely expected when we discussed the prior quarter results back in July and then highlighted during the quarter at a conference appearance. We weren't alone as the industry generally experienced tepid growth. For Zions, the primary reasons for the linked-quarter softness in loan growth were twofold: first, oil and gas loan balances declined more than $250 million in the third quarter; and secondly, we are, as we've noted, being quite conservative on commercial real estate lending. And in fact, we had more than $450 million less in new commercial real estate originations this past quarter as compared to the prior 2-quarter average.
In the third quarter, we experienced stronger growth in consumer loans, which were up 2.3% relative to the prior quarter-end and 10% over the prior year. Overall, over the past year, we experienced what we feel to be an acceptable 6% growth in loans and 4% growth in deposits. Prudent loan growth is among our top priorities, and some of the steps we're taking to help ensure that growth include finding ways to accelerate the time required to move loan applications through the approval and funding process and adding additional mortgage loan originators and loading additional resources in a couple of our specialty lending areas.
Moving to Slide 8. As a general comment, we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle. And we don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall, credit quality metrics were relatively consistent with those we recorded in the prior quarter, with a moderate increase in nonperforming assets but a decline in both gross and net loan charge-offs.
Slide 8 looks at the credit quality indicators of the non-oil and gas portfolio. In the third quarter, we experienced net loan recoveries of $11 million, bringing the year-to-date figure to a net recovery of $10 million on a portfolio of about $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans.
On Slide 9, you can see that with regard to the oil and gas lending portfolio, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally, although we do not expect -- although we do expect the oilfield services portfolio to weigh on credit quality for a while longer.
We that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $117 million or $0.57 per share.
Harris has just discussed the increases in 2 key revenue line items, and I'll talk a bit more about expenses shortly. But before we leave this page, I'd like to highlight 2 key areas: first, return on assets have increased to 84 basis points, up from 69 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased to 7.9% from 6.1% in the year-ago period. We are committed to increasing these measures of balance sheet return and profitability, and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement.
Let me take -- make a few comments about our revenue. About 3/4 of our revenue comes from net interest income, driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer-related funding. Slide 11 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios.
We remain encouraged with growth in the areas that are targeted for growth, although we certainly would have liked to see more growth in the third quarter, especially in C&I. As we mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward. And indeed, in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, CRE loans increased at an annualized rate of just less than 5%, which is slower than the 11% rate of increase relative to the year-ago period.
Total originations in CRE declined more than 30% from the prior 2-quarter average or more than $450 fewer dollars originated. We expect non-oil and gas commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate portfolio and the oil and gas portfolio.
Slide 12 outlines the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 10.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by $2.5 billion of growth in average loans and $4.6 billion of growth in the investment portfolio.
While we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide, we have developed a -- deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of which, when combined with continued growth of customer deposits, have resulted in a somewhat less asset-sensitive position than has been the case in recent years. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point short-term rate increase would produce between $25 million and $30 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the Zion composition of balance sheet.
It will take a few quarters for the impact of any short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized as only half -- about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR prime. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assumed 1 additional 25 basis point Fed funds target rate increase in December of 2016.
Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the third quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position and in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and to better balance the company's risk return profile.
During the third quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased to net $872 million when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about 4 years, with the duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating rate SBA securities, is about 2.8 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of investment portfolio and loan production, can be seen on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.11%. Some of that compression was attributable to a decline in income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. The remainder was primarily due to reduced fee income that was amortized on commercial loan as the weighted average coupon of the portfolio declined only 1 basis point when compared to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped again this quarter, similar to the move in the prior quarter, which was primarily due to increased premium amortization.
Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income. Total noninterest income increased $145 million from $126 million in the year-ago period. Customer-related fees, as stated in the slide and in the press release, increased to $125 million from $113 million a year ago. The notable areas experiencing significant growth include mortgage, treasury management and wealth management. Within customer-related fees, there were about $3 million of income that came from a variety of items that are unlikely to reoccur in our opinion.
Outside of customer-related fees, approximately $11 million of the income in noninterest income was attributable to the strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in our small business investment company portfolio. We would not expect that income to recur in future quarters.
Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased 3.1% from the prior year. And if adjusted for items such as severance, as displayed in our GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back, the increase was closer to 5.6% from the year-ago period. However, as noted on the slide, there were a few items that caused the results to be elevated, which we do not necessarily expect to recur in future quarters. Some of these items include, for example, an adjustment to our health care and benefits cost, which is about $5 million, impacting the salaries and employee benefits line item. Some of this was related to elevated -- an elevated level of lump-sum pension distributions, and as you know, this is where employees choose to withdraw their pension benefits all at once.
There was an adjustment to professional services cost of about $2 million related to further enhancements in our risk modeling. There was a linked-quarter increase of about $8.5 million in the amount set aside for legal settlements and judgment. And some of the elevated expense was partially offset by a lower accrual for executive compensation, which impacted the salary and benefit line.
In summary, when you add the pluses and minuses, the total noninterest expense line item was a few million dollars higher than what we believe is the typical quarterly run rate. We remain confident in achieving our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion of adjusted noninterest expense for 2016. As we said in our February Investor Day, if we cannot achieve this goal through reducing inefficiencies within the company, we will reduce executive compensation.
Finally on Slide 17, we have increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share per quarter. Additionally, we began executing on our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million between July 2016 and June 2017. We expect to maintain a relatively strong capital ratio, but we do believe the company is overcapitalized relative to its risk profile, and the buyback plan should be helpful in keeping that overcapitalized position from strengthening further.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

Well, let me start with just a high-level commentary on the oil and gas portfolio, and that is that we remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen strong equity injections into the companies during the third quarter, and borrower and sponsor sentiment has certainly improved in many of the segments.
However, at the same time, we continue to experience difficult challenges in the oilfield services portfolio that we believe will continue well into next year. On balance, we think the impact to earnings from oil and gas problem credits over the next several quarters will be substantially less than what we've been experiencing over the last year or so simply because over the last 2 years, we've been building the reserve against the oil and gas portfolio and charge-offs were ramping up. And over the next year or more, we expect the charge-offs will be tapering down, and we are in the early innings of seeing reserve releases.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect oil and gas net charge-offs to trend downward somewhat from the last 12 months, reflecting our continued cautious optimism. And we expect that we'll experience a gradual release of the oil and gas allowance for credit losses over the coming quarters.
On Slide 18, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other, which is essentially the mid- and downstream portfolio, primarily centered in midstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased $256 million from the prior quarter. This was probably the greatest decline in energy outstandings we've seen in any quarter today.
Additionally, we're seeing a fairly large number of favorable resolutions each quarter. Over the last 6 months, approximately $625 million of criticized balances were resolved through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades, which is nearly 80% of the beginning balance. The biggest decline came from the services portfolio, which declined more than $130 million, and about $100 million of which was favorable resolutions.
Looking at the problem loan metrics of the oil and gas portfolio. Classified oil and gas loan balances decreased $44 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, a much improved performance compared to the prior quarter's deterioration. Total nonaccrual balances increased, with all of the increase coming from the services portfolio. As I've noted in the past, the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on payments.
Turning to Slide 19 regarding our loss expectations. Assuming oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher and natural gas similarly positioned favorably as well, we expect energy losses for the next 4 quarters to be somewhat less than in the past year and that most of those losses will come from the services portfolio.
The third quarter losses reflect the results also of the shared national credit exam, both in terms of our loan quality and charge-off metrics that we've reported. Although the losses remain elevated, we have a strong reserve set aside against our oil and gas loans. The reserve is more than $200 million, which represents more than 8% of outstanding balances.
On Slide 20 is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth in pre-provision -- in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan deposit customer information infrastructure in the United States.
When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers and improve our new product time-to-market, position us well to more aggressively adopt the enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals, as discussed earlier. Regarding return of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders.
Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the industry leading results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research.
With that, Paul, I'll turn the call back to you."

I'll draw your attention to Slide 22, which depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the sort of mid-single digits.
We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. Although our efficiency target looking forward into 2017 include the assumption of 1 additional quarter rate point hike in December, we believe we can achieve our targeted growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target Fed funds rate.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of just over $15 million this quarter, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitment. This was assisted by various net recoveries outside of the oil and gas portfolio. We do not believe that is a sustainable level, and thus, we believe the provision for credit losses will likely be more consistent with the level that we experienced in the first half of 2016, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.
We expect the customer-related fees, which we define as our -- which we define in our press release and which exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, will be stable from the level reported in the third quarter, which had been noted on the slide to include about $3 million of miscellaneous income that we don't consider likely to recur, at least on a sustainable basis.
We remain committed to achieving our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016, which implies about $395 million or less in the fourth quarter. In the first half of 2017, we expect to experience a typical seasonal variation, as was seen in the first half of 2016, with most of that variation occurring in the first quarter.
Although we are striving to keep expenses low and stable, the outlook for the next 4 quarters is consistent with the initial goal outlined in June 2015, which called for a slight increase in 2017 relative to 2016. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% over the next 4 quarters, and we expect preferred dividends to be between $40 million and $45 million over the next 12 months. And as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher-cost preferred equity, although we do not expect that to have a material benefit to the forward 4-quarter outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Candice, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

So -- and that number is, again, very nicely a little bit stronger than we would have expected. So -- and it's across the board, which is really important.

The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.57 from $0.41 per share in the year-ago quarter by using the same adjustments we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjust for securities portfolio gains. In this case, earnings per share increased 26% over the prior year third quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.
If you go to Slide 4, we're on track with all of the targets we outlined in our June 2015 efficiency announcement. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce expenses. For example, the number of total full-time equivalent employees was down 251 or about 2.5% at the end of September from where it was a year ago. And revenue growth also remains a primary focus to drive earnings growth.
On Slide 5, we're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of both solid net interest income growth, which increased 10.7% over the past year, and a 10.3% improvement in adjusted noninterest income, with the primary adjustment again being the elimination of securities gains. And as noted, we're also focused on maintaining expenses at a level that we expect to be essentially flat to the back end of last year.
Turning to Slide 6. We posted an efficiency ratio of 66% in the third quarter and are at 66.3% for the year-to-date number. Recall our goal for 2016 is to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66% while maintaining adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion. Although not shown on this page, I'll point out that adjusted noninterest expense was above the target rate in the third quarter, which is largely attributable to several items that we expect to not recur in the fourth quarter. Paul Burdiss will review this a little later in his prepared remarks. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects.
Moving to Slide 7, we experienced soft loan growth in the third quarter, which we largely expected when we discussed the prior quarter results back in July and then highlighted during the quarter at a conference appearance. We weren't alone as the industry generally experienced tepid growth. For Zions, the primary reasons for the linked-quarter softness in loan growth were twofold: first, oil and gas loan balances declined more than $250 million in the third quarter; and secondly, we are, as we've noted, being quite conservative on commercial real estate lending. And in fact, we had more than $450 million less in new commercial real estate originations this past quarter as compared to the prior 2-quarter average.
In the third quarter, we experienced stronger growth in consumer loans, which were up 2.3% relative to the prior quarter-end and 10% over the prior year. Overall, over the past year, we experienced what we feel to be an acceptable 6% growth in loans and 4% growth in deposits. Prudent loan growth is among our top priorities, and some of the steps we're taking to help ensure that growth include finding ways to accelerate the time required to move loan applications through to the approval and funding process and adding additional mortgage loan originators and loading additional resources in a couple of our specialty lending areas.
Moving to Slide 8. As a general comment, we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle. And we don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall, credit quality metrics were relatively consistent with those we recorded in the prior quarter, with a moderate increase in nonperforming assets but a decline in both gross and net loan charge-offs.
Slide 8 looks at the credit quality indicators of the non-oil and gas portfolio. In the third quarter, we experienced net loan recoveries of $11 million, bringing the year-to-date figure to a net recovery of $10 million on a portfolio of about $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans.
On Slide 9, you can see that with regard to the oil and gas lending portfolio, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally, although we do not expect -- although we do expect the oilfield services portfolio to weigh on credit quality for a while longer.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $117 million or $0.57 per share.
Harris has just discussed the increases in 2 key revenue line items, and I'll talk a bit more about expenses shortly. But before we leave this page, I'd like to highlight 2 key areas: first, return on assets have increased 84 basis points, up from 69 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased to 7.9% from 6.1% in the year-ago period. We are committed to increasing these measures of balance sheet return and profitability, and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement.
Let me take -- make a few comments about our revenue. About 3/4 of our revenue comes from net interest income, driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer-related funding. Slide 11 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios.
We remain encouraged with growth in the areas that are targeted for growth, although we certainly would have liked to see more growth in the third quarter, especially in C&I. As we mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward. And indeed, in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, CRE loans increased at an annualized rate of just less than 5%, which is slower than the 11% rate of increase relative to the year-ago period.
Total originations in CRE declined more than 30% from the prior 2-quarter average or more than $450 fewer dollars originated. We expect non-oil and gas commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate portfolio and the oil and gas portfolio.
Slide 12 outlines the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 10.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by $2.5 billion of growth in average loans and $4.6 billion of growth in the investment portfolio.
While we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide, we have developed a -- deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of which, when combined with continued growth of customer deposits, have resulted in a somewhat less asset-sensitive position than has been the case in recent years. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point short-term rate increase would produce between $25 million and $30 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the Zion composition of balance sheet.
It will take a few quarters for the impact of any short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized as only half -- about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR prime. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assumed 1 additional 25 basis point Fed funds target rate increase in December of 2016.
Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the third quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position and in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and to better balance the company's risk return profile.
During the third quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased to net $872 million when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about 4 years, with the duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating rate SBA securities, is about 2.8 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of the investment portfolio and loan production, can be seen on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.11%. Some of that compression was attributable to a decline in income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. The remainder was primarily due to reduced fee income that was amortized on commercial loan as the weighted average coupon of the portfolio declined only 1 basis point when compared to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped again this quarter, similar to the move in the prior quarter, which was primarily due to increased premium amortization.
Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income. Total noninterest income increased $145 million from $126 million in the year-ago period. Customer-related fees, as stated in the slide and in the press release, increased to $125 million from $113 million a year ago. The notable areas experiencing significant growth include mortgage, treasury management and wealth management. Within customer-related fees, there were about $3 million of income that came from a variety of items that are unlikely to reoccur in our opinion.
Outside of customer-related fees, approximately $11 million of the income in noninterest income was attributable to the strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in our small business investment company portfolio. We would not expect that income to recur in future quarters.
Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased 3.1% from the prior year. And if adjusted for items such as severance, as displayed in our GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back, the increase was closer to 5.6% from the year-ago period. However, as noted on the slide, there were a few items that caused the results to be elevated, which we do not necessarily expect to recur in future quarters. Some of these items include, for example, an adjustment to our health care and benefits cost, which is about $5 million, impacting the salaries and employee benefits line item. Some of this was related to elevated -- an elevated level of lump-sum pension distributions, and as you know, this is where employees choose to withdraw their pension benefits all at once.
There was an adjustment to professional services cost of about $2 million related to further enhancements in our risk modeling. There was a linked-quarter increase of about $8.5 million in the amount set aside for legal settlements and judgments. And some of the elevated expense was partially offset by a lower accrual for executive compensation, which impacted the salary and benefit line.
In summary, when you add the pluses and minuses, the total noninterest expense line item was a few million dollars higher than what we believe is the typical quarterly run rate. We remain confident in achieving our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion of adjusted noninterest expense for 2016. As we said in our February Investor Day, if we cannot achieve this goal through reducing inefficiencies within the company, we will reduce executive compensation.
Finally on Slide 17, we have increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share per quarter. Additionally, we began executing on our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million between July 2016 and June 2017. We expect to maintain a relatively strong capital ratio, but we do believe the company is overcapitalized relative to its risk profile, and the buyback plan should be helpful in keeping that overcapitalized position from strengthening further.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

Well, let me start with just a high-level commentary on the oil and gas portfolio, and that is that we remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen strong equity injections into the companies during the third quarter, and borrower and sponsor sentiment has certainly improved in many of the segments.
However, at the same time, we continue to experience difficult challenges in the oilfield services portfolio that we believe will continue well into next year. On balance, we think the impact to earnings from oil and gas problem credits over the next several quarters will be substantially less than what we've been experiencing over the last year or so simply because over the last 2 years, we've been building the reserve against the oil and gas portfolio and charge-offs were ramping up. And over the next year or more, we expect the charge-offs will be tapering down, and we are in the early innings of seeing reserve releases.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect oil and gas net charge-offs to trend downward somewhat from the last 12 months, reflecting our continued cautious optimism. And we expect that we'll experience a gradual release of the oil and gas allowance for credit losses over the coming quarters.
On Slide 18, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other, which is essentially the mid- and downstream portfolio, primarily centered in midstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased $256 million from the prior quarter. This was probably the greatest decline in energy outstandings we've seen in any quarter today.
Additionally, we're seeing a fairly large number of favorable resolutions each quarter. Over the last 6 months, approximately $625 million of criticized balances were resolved through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades, which is nearly 80% of the beginning balance. The biggest decline came from the services portfolio, which declined more than $130 million, and about $100 million of which was favorable resolutions.
Looking at the problem loan metrics of the oil and gas portfolio. Classified oil and gas loan balances decreased $44 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, a much improved performance compared to the prior quarter's deterioration. Total nonaccrual balances increased, with all of the increase coming from the services portfolio. As I've noted in the past, the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on payments.
Turning to Slide 19 regarding our loss expectations. Assuming oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher and natural gas similarly positioned favorably as well, we expect energy losses for the next 4 quarters to be somewhat less than in the past year and that most of those losses will come from the services portfolio.
The third quarter losses reflect the results also of the shared national credit exam, both in terms of our loan quality and charge-off metrics that we've reported. Although the losses remain elevated, we have a strong reserve set aside against our oil and gas loans. The reserve is more than $200 million, which represents more than 8% of outstanding balances.
On Slide 20 is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth in pre-provision -- in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan deposit customer information infrastructure in the United States.
When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers and improve our new product time-to-market, position us well to more aggressively adopt the enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals, as discussed earlier. Regarding return of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders.
Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the industry leading results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research.
With that, Paul, I'll turn the call back to you."

I'll draw your attention to Slide 22, which depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the sort of mid-single digits.
We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. Although our efficiency target looking forward into 2017 include the assumption of 1 additional quarter rate point hike in December, we believe we can achieve our targeted growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target Fed funds rate.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of just over $15 million this quarter, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments. This was assisted by various net recoveries outside of the oil and gas portfolio. We do not believe that is a sustainable level, and thus, we believe the provision for credit losses will likely be more consistent with the level that we experienced in the first half of 2016, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.
We expect the customer-related fees, which we define as our -- which we define in our press release and which exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, will be stable from the level reported in the third quarter, which had been noted on the slide to include about $3 million of miscellaneous income that we don't consider likely to recur, at least on a sustainable basis.
We remain committed to achieving our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016, which implies about $395 million or less in the fourth quarter. In the first half of 2017, we expect to experience a typical seasonal variation, as was seen in the first half of 2016, with most of that variation occurring in the first quarter.
Although we are striving to keep expenses low and stable, the outlook for the next 4 quarters is consistent with the initial goal outlined in June 2015, which called for a slight increase in 2017 relative to 2016. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% over the next 4 quarters, and we expect preferred dividends to be between $40 million and $45 million over the next 12 months. And as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher-cost preferred equity, although we do not expect that to have a material benefit to the forward 4-quarter outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Candice, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

We think that, that's actually a really important kind of long-term investment to be making in a digital age that we're in. That's costing us -- it cost us about $35 million this year and about the same next year. At the -- when we come out the other end of this, which is still -- it's kind of 3 years away, but I do expect that's going to create a much simpler back office in this place. And that's where the real opportunity is. And so we're really focused on doing things that aren't just very short term but really reinvent how we do business starting with systems. And so I don't envision changing course but I think we're going to continue to make pretty good progress.

So the -- I think the more important number we're focused on is just the absolute dollar amount of customer-related fees and total fee income and how that's accretive to earnings. So -- and that number is, again, very nicely a little bit stronger than we even would have expected. So -- and it's across the board, which is really important. It's in our -- workhorse fee income item is Treasury Management. It's about 30% of our $500 million in fee income. It's growing very nicely on a linked-quarter year-over-year basis as well as year-to-date. Our credit card income is growing nicely. Wealth Management, we basically had 2 Wealth Management platforms.

The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures.

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.57 from $0.41 per share in the year-ago quarter by using the same adjustments we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjust for securities portfolio gains. In this case, earnings per share increased 26% over the prior year third quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.
If you go to Slide 4, we're on track with all of the targets we outlined in our June 2015 efficiency announcement. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce expenses. For example, the number of total full-time equivalent employees was down 251 or about 2.5% at the end of September from where it was a year ago. And revenue growth also remains a primary focus to drive earnings growth.
On Slide 5, we're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of both solid net interest income growth, which increased 10.7% over the past year, and a 10.3% improvement in adjusted noninterest income, with the primary adjustment again being the elimination of securities gains. And as noted, we're also focused on maintaining expenses at a level that we expect to be essentially flat to the back end of last year.
Turning to Slide 6. We posted an efficiency ratio of 66% in the third quarter and are at 66.3% for the year-to-date number. Recall our goal for 2016 is to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66% while maintaining adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion. Although not shown on this page, I'll point out that adjusted noninterest expense was above the target rate in the third quarter, which is largely attributable to several items that we expect to not recur in the fourth quarter. Paul Burdiss will review this a little later in his prepared remarks. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects.
Moving to Slide 7. We experienced soft loan growth in the third quarter, which we largely expected when we discussed the prior quarter results back in July and then highlighted during the quarter at a conference appearance. We weren't alone as the industry generally experienced tepid growth. For Zions, the primary reasons for the linked-quarter softness in loan growth were twofold: first, oil and gas loan balances declined more than $250 million in the third quarter; and secondly, we are, as we've noted, being quite conservative on commercial real estate lending. And in fact, we had more than $450 million less in new commercial real estate originations this past quarter as compared to the prior 2-quarter average.
In the third quarter, we experienced stronger growth in consumer loans, which were up 2.3% relative to the prior quarter-end and 10% over the prior year. Overall, over the past year, we experienced what we feel to be an acceptable 6% growth in loans and 4% growth in deposits. Prudent loan growth is among our top priorities, and some of the steps we're taking to help ensure that growth include finding ways to accelerate the time required to move loan applications through to the approval and funding process and adding additional mortgage loan originators and loading additional resources in a couple of our specialty lending areas.
Moving to Slide 8. As a general comment, we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle. And we don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall, credit quality metrics were relatively consistent with those we recorded in the prior quarter, with a moderate increase in nonperforming assets but a decline in both gross and net loan charge-offs.
Slide 8 looks at the credit quality indicators of the non-oil and gas portfolio. In the third quarter, we experienced net loan recoveries of $11 million, bringing the year-to-date figure to a net recovery of $10 million on a portfolio of about $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans.
On Slide 9, you can see that with regard to the oil and gas lending portfolio, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally, although we do not expect -- although we do expect the oilfield services portfolio to weigh on credit quality for a while longer.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?"

Thank you for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $117 million or $0.57 per share.
Harris has just discussed the increases in 2 key revenue line items, and I'll talk a bit more about expenses shortly. But before we leave this page, I'd like to highlight 2 key areas: first, return on assets have increased 84 basis points, up from 69 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased to 7.9% from 6.1% in the year-ago period. We are committed to increasing these measures of balance sheet return and profitability, and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement.
Let me take -- make a few comments about our revenue. About 3/4 of our revenue comes from net interest income, driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer-related funding. Slide 11 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios.
We remain encouraged with growth in the areas that are targeted for growth, although we certainly would have liked to see more growth in the third quarter, especially in C&I. As we mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward. And indeed, in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, CRE loans increased at an annualized rate of just less than 5%, which is slower than the 11% rate of increase relative to the year-ago period.
Total originations in CRE declined more than 30% from the prior 2-quarter average or more than $450 fewer dollars originated. We expect non-oil and gas commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate portfolio and the oil and gas portfolio.
Slide 12 outlines the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 10.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by $2.5 billion of growth in average loans and $4.6 billion of growth in the investment portfolio.
While we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide, we have developed a -- deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of which, when combined with continued growth of customer deposits, have resulted in a somewhat less asset-sensitive position than has been the case in recent years. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point short-term rate increase would produce between $25 million and $30 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the Zion composition of balance sheet.
It will take a few quarters for the impact of any short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized as only half -- about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR prime. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assumed 1 additional 25 basis point Fed funds target rate increase in December of 2016.
Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the third quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position and in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and to better balance the company's risk return profile.
During the third quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased to net $872 million when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about 4 years, with the duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating rate SBA securities, is about 2.8 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of the investment portfolio and loan production, can be seen on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.11%. Some of that compression was attributable to a decline in income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. The remainder was primarily due to reduced fee income that was amortized on commercial loan as the weighted average coupon of the portfolio declined only 1 basis point when compared to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped again this quarter, similar to the move in the prior quarter, which was primarily due to increased premium amortization.
Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income. Total noninterest income increased $145 million from $126 million in the year-ago period. Customer-related fees, as stated in the slide and in the press release, increased to $125 million from $113 million a year ago. The notable areas experiencing significant growth include mortgage, treasury management and wealth management. Within customer-related fees, there were about $3 million of income that came from a variety of items that are unlikely to reoccur in our opinion.
Outside of customer-related fees, approximately $11 million of the income in noninterest income was attributable to the strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in our small business investment company portfolio. We would not expect that income to recur in future quarters.
Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased 3.1% from the prior year. And if adjusted for items such as severance, as displayed in our GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back, the increase was closer to 5.6% from the year-ago period. However, as noted on the slide, there were a few items that caused the results to be elevated, which we do not necessarily expect to recur in future quarters. Some of these items include, for example, an adjustment to our health care and benefits cost, which is about $5 million, impacting the salaries and employee benefits line item. Some of this was related to elevated -- an elevated level of lump-sum pension distributions, and as you know, this is where employees choose to withdraw their pension benefits all at once.
There was an adjustment to professional services cost of about $2 million related to further enhancements in our risk modeling. There was a linked-quarter increase of about $8.5 million in the amount set aside for legal settlements and judgments. And some of the elevated expense was partially offset by a lower accrual for executive compensation, which impacted the salary and benefit line.
In summary, when you add the pluses and minuses, the total noninterest expense line item was a few million dollars higher than what we believe is the typical quarterly run rate. We remain confident in achieving our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion of adjusted noninterest expense for 2016. As we said in our February Investor Day, if we cannot achieve this goal through reducing inefficiencies within the company, we will reduce executive compensation.
Finally on Slide 17, we have increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share per quarter. Additionally, we began executing on our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million between July 2016 and June 2017. We expect to maintain a relatively strong capital ratio, but we do believe the company is overcapitalized relative to its risk profile, and the buyback plan should be helpful in keeping that overcapitalized position from strengthening further.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

Well, let me start with just a high-level commentary on the oil and gas portfolio, and that is that we remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen strong equity injections into the companies during the third quarter, and borrower and sponsor sentiment has certainly improved in many of the segments.
However, at the same time, we continue to experience difficult challenges in the oilfield services portfolio that we believe will continue well into next year. On balance, we think the impact to earnings from oil and gas problem credits over the next several quarters will be substantially less than what we've been experiencing over the last year or so simply because over the last 2 years, we've been building the reserve against the oil and gas portfolio and charge-offs were ramping up. And over the next year or more, we expect the charge-offs will be tapering down, and we are in the early innings of seeing reserve releases.
Over the next 4 quarters, we expect oil and gas net charge-offs to trend downward somewhat from the last 12 months, reflecting our continued cautious optimism. And we expect that we'll experience a gradual release of the oil and gas allowance for credit losses over the coming quarters.
On Slide 18, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other, which is essentially the mid- and downstream portfolio, primarily centered in midstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased $256 million from the prior quarter. This was probably the greatest decline in energy outstandings we've seen in any quarter today.
Additionally, we're seeing a fairly large number of favorable resolutions each quarter. Over the last 6 months, approximately $625 million of criticized balances were resolved through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades, which is nearly 80% of the beginning balance. The biggest decline came from the services portfolio, which declined more than $130 million, and about $100 million of which was favorable resolutions.
Looking at the problem loan metrics of the oil and gas portfolio. Classified oil and gas loan balances decreased $44 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, a much improved performance compared to the prior quarter's deterioration. Total nonaccrual balances increased, with all of the increase coming from the services portfolio. As I've noted in the past, the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on payments.
Turning to Slide 19 regarding our loss expectations. Assuming oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher and natural gas similarly positioned favorably as well, we expect energy losses for the next 4 quarters to be somewhat less than in the past year and that most of those losses will come from the services portfolio.
The third quarter losses reflect the results also of the shared national credit exam, both in terms of our loan quality and charge-off metrics that we've reported. Although the losses remain elevated, we have a strong reserve set aside against our oil and gas loans. The reserve is more than $200 million, which represents more than 8% of outstanding balances.
On Slide 20 is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth in pre-provision -- in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan deposit customer information infrastructure in the United States.
When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers and improve our new product time-to-market, position us well to more aggressively adopt the enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.
Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals, as discussed earlier. Regarding return of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders.
Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the industry leading results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research.
With that, Paul, I'll turn the call back to you."

I'll draw your attention to Slide 22, which depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the sort of mid-single digits.
We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. Although our efficiency target looking forward into 2017 include the assumption of 1 additional quarter rate point hike in December, we believe we can achieve our targeted growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target Fed funds rate.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of just over $15 million this quarter, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments. This was assisted by various net recoveries outside of the oil and gas portfolio. We do not believe that is a sustainable level, and thus, we believe the provision for credit losses will likely be more consistent with the level that we experienced in the first half of 2016, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.
We expect the customer-related fees, which we define as our -- which we define in our press release and which exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, will be stable from the level reported in the third quarter, which had been noted on the slide to include about $3 million of miscellaneous income that we don't consider likely to recur, at least on a sustainable basis.
We remain committed to achieving our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016, which implies about $395 million or less in the fourth quarter. In the first half of 2017, we expect to experience a typical seasonal variation, as was seen in the first half of 2016, with most of that variation occurring in the first quarter.
Although we are striving to keep expenses low and stable, the outlook for the next 4 quarters is consistent with the initial goal outlined in June 2015, which called for a slight increase in 2017 relative to 2016. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% over the next 4 quarters, and we expect preferred dividends to be between $40 million and $45 million over the next 12 months. And as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher-cost preferred equity, although we do not expect that to have a material benefit to the forward 4-quarter outlook.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Candice, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you."

And I think also, it's just very hard to project out 4 quarters, particularly as it relates to our energy services portfolio, number one. Number two, the -- we'll finish this year -- well, let me just say it this way. Through 9 months, we're net recovered on 94% of our loan portfolio. So we do -- while we generally trend around 10 to 12 basis points in net charge-offs per year over the last 3 or 4 years, we're running right now at a net recovery position. So I think our assumption is, while we think we'll see improvement, we're optimistic on the oil and gas charge-off front, we do believe we should naturally see some charge-offs on the non-oil and gas piece."

We think that, that's actually a really important kind of long-term investment to be making in a digital age that we're in. That's costing us -- it cost us about $35 million this year and about the same next year. At the -- when we come out the other end of this, which is still -- it's kind of 3 years away, but I do expect that's going to create a much simpler back office in this place.

So the -- I think the more important number we're focused on is just the absolute dollar amount of customer-related fees and total fee income and how that's accretive to earnings. So -- and that number is, again, very nicely a little bit stronger than we even would have expected. So -- and it's across the board, which is really important. It's in our -- workhorse fee income item is Treasury Management. It's about 30% of our $500 million in fee income. It's growing very nicely on a linked-quarter year-over-year basis as well as year-to-date. Our credit card income is growing nicely. Wealth Management, we basically had 2 Wealth Management platforms.

On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By u",1020,"Thank you very much, James, and welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results. On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily to adjust for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago, and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter. We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that were well controlled and that remain within the parameters of our stated expense initiatives.
Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%. We also experienced improved loan growth. The second quarter loans increased 2.6% from the prior quarter. So it was a good quarter for loan growth.
Credit quality is a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. We consistently tried to be very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolio through this energy cycle. It remains challenged, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later. Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So we get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we're actually really, really pleased with the quality that we're seeing there.
Turning to Slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue has improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck, with the major exclusion of the effect of securities gains and losses. We have been -- and we've been successful at improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth and adjusted pre-provision net revenue, although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loans held for investment increasing 2.6%, as previously noted. Deposit balance has increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits.
On Slide 6, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although we've experienced strong growth in termed commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect nonenergy, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth to be the primary drivers of loan growth over the next few quarters.
We continue to expect a decline in the national real estate portfolio that we discussed on prior occasions. I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters. So while we're particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. We are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio at less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted, year-to-date, the efficiency ratio is 66.5%; quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit loan systems, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us, once we complete these projects over the next 2 or 3 years.
On Slide 8 is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in a number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of the major initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.
My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted the Zions' loan quality is measured by net loan losses that has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On Slide 9, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio, but with our strong reserve, we presently expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses over the next year at a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company, as noted, and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consist of nonenergy loans, and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last 5 quarters has a medium -- a median of only 1 basis point annualized Nonperforming assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and the nonenergy classified loans declined and 90-plus day delinquency has also declined. So some good metrics there.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burgess to review the financial results. Paul?"

Relative to the second quarter of last year, net intere",1540,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015. At $382 million, noninterest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Although the year-ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation, which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016 for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our noninterest expense commitment.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. At our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next 4 quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast. Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors and improved capital markets activity in that industry. However, because we remain cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintain the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserve. The resulting reserve, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding. Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked-quarter increase was due to several various factors. Most of the increase was due to the strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities. 
We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of both the assets, combined with continued deposit growth, have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25-basis-point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assume 1 additional 25-basis-point federal funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was priced again about a 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million on average when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in that investment portfolio.
The mortgage-backed securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, right around 3 years, with duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year, if rates increase by 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating-rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our model estimates that duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years. A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise, thus, in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. Top line is the loan yield, which expanded 2 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.16%, and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or repriced during the quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter largely due to increased premium amortization, which was in turn due to higher prepayment rates. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. 
At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets, which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points, and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investments resulted in a 4-basis-point increase in the net interest margin this quarter. Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than 5 basis points in the near term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities.  Over the longer term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth, although most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced. The overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin, but a continued increase in net interest income.
Turning to Slide 14, and noninterest income. Because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%; wealth management, which was up 9%; and mortgage up 16%. Notably, in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loan held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific gain to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.
Noninterest expense on Slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck, the decline was 2.6% from the year-ago period. Although I will note that about half of that improvement is due to the timing of stock-based compensation, which we have had discussed previously. For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted noninterest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know, in the first quarter, we incurred seasonal expenses, which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million, stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million and payroll taxes declined $4 million, when we observe the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next 4 quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to a lower level in order to align the capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

On Slide 17, we show on the left side of the slide, the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter, with declines principally in upstream and services -- and the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio. Parenthetically, you will note on Slide 22, that energy loan commitments declined more than $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year.
Looking at the problem loan metrics again on Slide 17 for the oil and gas portfolio. Classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million during the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in the -- in quarter 1, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstanding. Also of note, and easier to see on Slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1. Finally, nonaccrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their contractual payment.
On Slide 18, regarding our loss expectations. If oil were to hold in the mid-40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we've flagged as high risk for loss already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have improved our outlook on energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers and sponsors suggest that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices. Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this a very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.
If you turn to Slide 19, this is the last of our key objectives and our commitments -- and our fundamental commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving the positive operating leverage we described. And I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages. Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.
Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our return of capital to shareholders. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with local communities, with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only 1 of 4 banks that have performed at the industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately 8 years ago.
Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced. Although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong, we are going to remain disciplined in our concentration of risk management, avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio. Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although our efficiency target includes the assumption of one additional quarter point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.
We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments, to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions. We expect that customer-related noninterest income, which includes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.
For the next 4 quarters, we expect noninterest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of '17, as was seen in the first quarter of '16. The effective tax rate for the second quarter returned to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter, we recognized a one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. With the successful tender completed in the second quarter, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $45 million over the next 12 months.

But you're posing a hypothetical. I guess I would say, clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress testing the model to think about risk, particularly in a downturn to inform how we think about capital. And there are a lot of things that we have dealt the risk management-wise here in the last 5 or 6 or 7 years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes, I think we would agree that we've got more capital. And we're at the north end of where our peers are. I would note that we'll always want to be probably kind of to the strong side, so long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. I mean, we know that those are both segments where you could see maybe a little more cyclicality among other things. And so if you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a race to the bottom, if you will, in terms of rating capital. But we want to kind of thoughtfully try to rightsize our capital and to grow into it. And I think we've got -- it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can do. I don't know, I hope that's helpful. I'm -- we know that we have more preferred than we probably need right now. That's something we've talked about and we continue to opportunistically deal with.

I would expect as we continue to see better results through CCAR that we'll be able to be a little more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask. And then, there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think it's really important to focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at pre-provision net revenue, there's operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters. It takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference. And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, I mean, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that -- I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision, as we said earlier. As we come off the other end, I think we're short of real deterioration -- significant deterioration than the rest of the economy. The other credit metrics around here are very strong. Our absolute reserves are strong. And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have is that we'll feed into ROEs, going to be a provision when we get through the energy cycle, but it's likely to be pretty low and will also help with ROE while we continue build this operating leverage that I'm talking about."

I'll just add to that, that the reason why you focus so much attention and communication about the positive operating leverage is that we really do believe that the basic assumptions about loan growth, redeploying cash, fee income growth, holding expenses flat, the resulting positive operating leverage that we modeled, boost us a long way over a 3-year period to a much more representative ROE.

The other thing I would note, we don't comment about it enough, but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined kind of January, February and the first part of March, and both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because recall that in our reserve-based lending activity, about 50% of the reserve is -- I mean, of the borrowing bases are natural gas reserves. So you really have to focus on both. But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid- to high 30s. And the sensitivity would've been down in the low -- in the high 20s, excuse me, high 20s to 30-ish. And so prices were treated here back to the high 30s. I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low 30s, high 20s, well then, it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment. Because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since 6 months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes. So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve base portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination, all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve base side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just an oilfield service question fundamentally and how long that will go on. And we believe that it'll go on into next year, even with -- even if prices continue to improve."

In our case though, we are helped by the fact that we continue to deploy cash into our highly liquid investment portfolio. And the result of that, obviously, is no increase in earning assets, the denominator, but an increase in net interest income. So net-net, that's helpful to the margin.

We can see about half of them and then we're assuming others will materialize. So there is an opportunity for a favorable performance relative to the $125 million. The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit -- as both Harris and Paul noted in their comment, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs.  And clearly, our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought, but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through 6 months. And we are clearly going to have less charge-offs than we anticipated there. So we continue to anticipate the same consolidated net charge-off experience that we've guided to.

By u",1020,"Thank you very much, James, and welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results. On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 from a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily to adjust for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago, and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter. We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted noninterest expense levels that were well controlled and that remain within the parameters of our stated expense initiatives.
Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%. We also experienced improved loan growth. The second quarter loans increased 2.6% from the prior quarter. So it was a good quarter for loan growth.
Credit quality is a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. We consistently tried to be very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolio through this energy cycle. It remains challenged, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later. Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So we get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we're actually really, really pleased with the quality that we're seeing there.
Turning to Slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue has improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck, with the major exclusion of the effect of securities gains and losses. We have been -- and we've been successful at improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth and adjusted pre-provision net revenue, although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.
On Slide 5, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loans held for investment increasing 2.6%, as previously noted. Deposit balance has increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits.
On Slide 6, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although we've experienced strong growth in termed commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect nonenergy, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth to be the primary drivers of loan growth over the next few quarters.
We continue to expect a decline in the national real estate portfolio that we discussed on prior occasions. I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters. So while we're particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. We are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio at less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted, year-to-date, the efficiency ratio is 66.5%; quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit loan systems, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us, once we complete these projects over the next 2 or 3 years.
On Slide 8 is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in a number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of the major initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and time lines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.
My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted the Zions' loan quality is measured by net loan losses that has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On Slide 9, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio, but with our strong reserve, we presently expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses over the next year at a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company, as noted, and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consist of nonenergy loans, and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last 5 quarters has a medium -- a median of only 1 basis point annualized Nonperforming assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and the nonenergy classified loans declined and 90-plus day delinquency has also declined. So some good metrics there.
With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burgess to review the financial results. Paul?"

Relative to the second quarter of last year, net intere",1540,"Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%. Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of noninterest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015. At $382 million, noninterest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Although the year-ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation, which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016 for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our noninterest expense commitment.
Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses. At our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next 4 quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast. Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors and improved capital markets activity in that industry. However, because we remain cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintain the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserve. The resulting reserve, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding. Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.
Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked-quarter increase was due to several various factors. Most of the increase was due to the strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities. 
We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of both the assets, combined with continued deposit growth, have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25-basis-point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect. As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assume 1 additional 25-basis-point federal funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was priced again about a 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continued to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million on average when compared to the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in that investment portfolio.
The mortgage-backed securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, right around 3 years, with duration extension risk being only about 0.5 year, if rates increase by 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating-rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our model estimates that duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years. A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise, thus, in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.
Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. Top line is the loan yield, which expanded 2 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.16%, and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or repriced during the quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter largely due to increased premium amortization, which was in turn due to higher prepayment rates. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. 
At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets, which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points, and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investments resulted in a 4-basis-point increase in the net interest margin this quarter. Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than 5 basis points in the near term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities.  Over the longer term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth, although most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced. The overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin, but a continued increase in net interest income.
Turning to Slide 14, and noninterest income. Because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%; wealth management, which was up 9%; and mortgage up 16%. Notably, in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loan held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific gain to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.
Noninterest expense on Slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck, the decline was 2.6% from the year-ago period. Although I will note that about half of that improvement is due to the timing of stock-based compensation, which we have had discussed previously. For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted noninterest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know, in the first quarter, we incurred seasonal expenses, which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million, stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million and payroll taxes declined $4 million, when we observe the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 16. We're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next 4 quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to a lower level in order to align the capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?"

On Slide 17, we show on the left side of the slide, the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter, with declines principally in upstream and services -- and the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio. Parenthetically, you will note on Slide 22, that energy loan commitments declined more than $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year.
Looking at the problem loan metrics again on Slide 17 for the oil and gas portfolio. Classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million during the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in the -- in quarter 1, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstanding. Also of note, and easier to see on Slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1. Finally, nonaccrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on their contractual payment.
On Slide 18, regarding our loss expectations. If oil were to hold in the mid-40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we've flagged as high risk for loss already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have improved our outlook on energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers and sponsors suggest that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices. Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this a very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.
If you turn to Slide 19, this is the last of our key objectives and our commitments -- and our fundamental commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving the positive operating leverage we described. And I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages. Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today, and we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.
Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our return of capital to shareholders. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with local communities, with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only 1 of 4 banks that have performed at the industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately 8 years ago.
Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you."

Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced. Although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong, we are going to remain disciplined in our concentration of risk management, avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio. Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although our efficiency target includes the assumption of one additional quarter point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.
We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss, which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments, to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions. We expect that customer-related noninterest income, which includes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted noninterest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.
For the next 4 quarters, we expect noninterest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of '17, as was seen in the first quarter of '16. The effective tax rate for the second quarter returned to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter, we recognized a one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. With the successful tender completed in the second quarter, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $45 million over the next 12 months.

But you're posing a hypothetical. I guess I would say, clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress testing the model to think about risk, particularly in a downturn to inform how we think about capital. And there are a lot of things that we have dealt the risk management-wise here in the last 5 or 6 or 7 years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes, I think we would agree that we've got more capital. And we're at the north end of where our peers are. I would note that we'll always want to be probably kind of to the strong side, so long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. I mean, we know that those are both segments where you could see maybe a little more cyclicality among other things. And so if you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a race to the bottom, if you will, in terms of rating capital. But we want to kind of thoughtfully try to rightsize our capital and to grow into it. And I think we've got -- it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can do. I don't know, I hope that's helpful. I'm -- we know that we have more preferred than we probably need right now. That's something we've talked about and we continue to opportunistically deal with.

I would expect as we continue to see better results through CCAR that we'll be able to be a little more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask. And then, there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think it's really important to focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at pre-provision net revenue, there's operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters. It takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference. And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, I mean, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that -- I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision, as we said earlier. As we come off the other end, I think we're short of real deterioration -- significant deterioration than the rest of the economy. The other credit metrics around here are very strong. Our absolute reserves are strong. And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have is that we'll feed into ROEs, going to be a provision when we get through the energy cycle, but it's likely to be pretty low and will also help with ROE while we continue build this operating leverage that I'm talking about."

The other thing I would note, we don't comment about it enough, but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined kind of January, February and the first part of March, and both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because recall that in our reserve-based lending activity, about 50% of the reserve is -- I mean, of the borrowing bases are natural gas reserves. So you really have to focus on both. But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid- to high 30s. And the sensitivity would've been down in the low -- in the high 20s, excuse me, high 20s to 30-ish. And so prices were treated here back to the high 30s. I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low 30s, high 20s, well then, it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment. Because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since 6 months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes. So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve base portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination, all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve base side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just an oilfield service question fundamentally and how long that will go on. And we believe that it'll go on into next year, even with -- even if prices continue to improve."

Industrial is an asset class that is in favor right now to us, especially in the markets that we serve. Hospitality, we have historically deemphasized, but we do select hospitality transactions. I would say anything that is horizontal development, like A&D, land, lots that isn't -- that aren't associated with homebuilder production and vertical construction are something -- is an asset class that we're definitely steering away from. Historically, it was in our mix, but today and going forward, it's a relatively small piece of the book."

One, as you described, is sort of the ongoing grinding of margins that we see. And that obviously adversely impacts the net interest margin. In our case though, we are helped by the fact that we continue to deploy cash into our highly liquid investment portfolio. And the result of that, obviously, is no increase in earning assets, the denominator, but an increase in net interest income. So net-net, that's helpful to the margin. So as I tried to say in prepared remarks, we're looking at maybe a couple of basis points, we think, over the next couple of quarters. But as you know, as an experienced observer of banks, that can be pretty hard to predict sometimes."

We think there'll be less in the second half of the year, but it's very hard to know. We don't have a clear line of sight right now to those second half of the year charge-offs. We can see about half of them and then we're assuming others will materialize. So there is an opportunity for a favorable performance relative to the $125 million. The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit -- as both Harris and Paul noted in their comment, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs.  And clearly, our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought, but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through 6 months. And we are clearly going to have less charge-offs than we anticipated there. So we continue to anticipate the same consolidated net charge-off experience that we've guided to. It's just going to be a little more weighted to energy."

And to date, last year and 3, 6 months this year, they've injected about $250 million of capital into our borrowers. Just back of the envelope, that would be 15% to 25% increased equity to those existing the deals, which generally were 50% equity, 50% debt using some broad generalizations here. So we've seen really strong performance from the private equity funds when you think of 15% to 25% equity injections in an 18-month period.
