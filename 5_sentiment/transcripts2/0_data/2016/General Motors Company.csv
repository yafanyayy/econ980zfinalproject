I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT-adjusted margin. To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue was $3",1425,"Thanks, Randy, and thanks everybody for joining the call. I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT-adjusted margin. 
To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue was $39.6 billion. EBIT-adjusted of 2.8 was up $400 million year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin of 7% was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.39 was up 17% over last year. 
And for the year, we generated record net income of $9.7 billion and record EBIT-adjusted of $10.8 billion. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted increased 65% to $5.02. And our 27.2% ROIC for 2015 demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation framework is paying off. 
Our record operating performance enabled us to return approximately $5.7 billion to our owners during 2015. This significant capital return demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value over time. 
I'd like to share a little progress about what we're doing as we lead the transformation of personal mobility and also what we're doing to strengthen our core business. We gained considerable momentum in the fourth quarter and early this year on game-changing personal mobility initiative. First, let's talk about ridesharing. Our announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant because we believe, together, we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else. We also believe in the short term the arrangement that we have with Lyft will allow us to capitalize on providing and being a preferred provider for short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers that will support not only General Motors performance but also Lyft performance. 
When we look in China, we've also introduced a carpooling pilot for 700 employees in Shanghai, and this is driven by a mobile app. And if you recall, what we talked about in October, having that interface and the connection through a smart device is very important, and we continue to build on that capability. 
As we look at car-sharing programs, we are doing a number of things that are really leveraging our connectivity leadership based on 2 decades of OnStar technology. First, we created, and that really brings together many of the pilots that are actually transforming from pilots into projects that we are replicating across different cities that allows us to have a single brand that we put all that together would also make sure that we have the experts not only from ridesharing and car-sharing experiences outside the company, we brought them in, but also connecting to the individuals in the company that understand the connected car. And acquiring sidecars, technology and assets is another proof point there as several of its employees have joined the team along with having access to that technology. 
In electrification front, we expanded our EV leadership as we unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV at CES. This is a vehicle that we plan on producing by year end. And for the second generation, the 2016 Volt 1 the green car of the year award, and that vehicle will be shipping shortly. 
And as we look at fuel cells, a longer-range technology, we now have a program with the U.S. Army where we are developing an extreme off-road hydrogen fuel-cell Chevrolet Colorado that will allow us to test our latest technology in military duty type cycles. So again very important.
In addition to the work that we're doing in the transformation of personal mobility, we also continue to work on strengthening our core business. Last year, GM hosted its third consecutive year of record sales, and we were #1 in North America, South America and China, demonstrating our commitment to our brands and our commitment to earning customers for life. In particular, we strengthened our global Chevrolet and Cadillac brands last year. In the U.S. Chevrolet grew retail market share faster than any other full-line brand in the industry, up by 0.4 percentage points. And our full-year global Cadillac sales are up 8%. And in China, it was a record 17%. 
In North America, we continue to be very disciplined in our sales approach and it's paying off. We had record ATPs and the best retail in total sales since 2007. GM's 2015 retail sales are up 8% over 2014. Our average GM ATPs of more than $34,600 exceed the industry average by $4,000. Our year-end total inventory was down more than 100,000 units or 14%, which is the lowest in 4 years. And in that 61 days, our 2015  year end supply was the lowest in 6 years. 
And we're also very pleased with the early signs and feedback that we're getting on the Chevrolet Malibu, again a very important vehicle that we are launching in January with a positive -- with very positive signal of how that car's going to be received into the marketplace. 
In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall have improved [ph] full year sales and market share for the third straight year. 
In China, GM posted record sales of 3.6 million vehicles, up 5% year-over-year, and we outpaced the industry on the strong mix of SUVs, MPVs and luxury vehicles. And just a couple of data points there. We achieved record overall market share of 14.9%, including more than 50% of the MPV segment. And for SUVs, our sales rose 144%, which was led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. 
And at GM Financial, we continue to make strides towards full captive capability. In 2015, 1 in every 3 of GM's retail sales was financed by GMF, and this was up from 1 in 10 just a year ago. 
We are well on our way of achieving the $5.5 billion in cost efficiency also that we talked about and we plan to do this by 2018. And we expect that these savings will more than offset the additional investments we're making in our brands and in the technology that we need to not only be compliant but to lead in the industry. 
In 2015, we had more than $2 billion in savings in nonraw material and logistics, ahead of the commitment and 2x of what we achieved in 2014. As we move into 2016, we expect another year of positive performance from material logistic standpoint. And I also want to add, we're doing it the right way with working and strengthening the relationship with many of our key suppliers. We'll also continue to leverage and drive efficiencies through using our operational excellence, which is built on Six Sigma, our Global Business Services and the IT transformation. 
Because of our 2015 performance and our expectations that we will sustain strong margins in the U.S. and China and break even in Europe this year, we already announced just last month that we had increased our projected 2016 earnings per share adjusted to between $5.25 and $5.75.
Before I close my initial comments, I also want to comment that we know there's been a lot written about the U.S. industry being at peak levels and that a downturn is imminent. We, like many others, do not share this view. Chuck is going to go into a little bit more detail on this, but we believe the industry fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry. Having said that, we understand that we are in a cyclical business and it's very difficult for any one to predict the timing of a downturn. And while we feel we are very well-positioned to take advantage of the strong market with important new product launches, we also have an intense focus on both costs and capital efficiencies to ensure that we will maximize earnings and cash flow through the cycle and are best prepared for whenever a downturn does occur. 
So in summary, we delivered our 2015 commitments despite a number of unforeseen headwinds, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 target across key financial metrics. And we believe we are well-positioned for profitable growth that will continue to drive shareholder value. We know we're in the midst of an industry that is being disruptive, and we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and our global resources to lead that disruption. We'll continue to strengthen our core business, and we'll also continue to invest in game-changers that are necessary for GM to lead the future of personal mobility. This team is committed to delivering results. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and 2015, and that is exactly what we plan to do in 2016 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,321713294,925425,"General Motors Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full-year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of",1357,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full-year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of key financial metrics, such as net income, consolidated EBIT-adjusted, consolidated EBIT-adjusted margin, North American EBIT-adjusted and North American EBIT-adjusted margins established records not only for the fourth quarter, but also for the full year. 
From an operating perspective, EBIT-adjusted results for the year grew to a record $10.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus 2014, adjusting 2014 from the impact of recalls. The EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1% is up 110 basis points year-over-year on the same basis. And our adjusted earnings per share for 2015 was up 65% to $5.02, another record compared with 2014 or up 22% year-over-year after adjusting 2014 for recalls. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvements during the year. Clearly, this team is committed to delivering on improving the company's profitability going forward. The strong earnings growth enabled significant capital returns to our owners as well, $5.7 billion in total between dividends and share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter and ultimately, the year, was adversely impacted by cash settlements for various litigation settlements, increased capital spending and UAW ratification bonuses. With that said, we are still very much on track for a significant increase in free cash flow in 2016. And I'll talk more about 2016 in just a couple of minutes.
Although we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2015, we continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business to ensure the positive momentum continues. As Mary mentioned, we expect to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. We expect these savings will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building and technology-related costs. All these cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, a corporate initiative which will drive common tools, common processes but, most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization. The GM team is very focused on carrying our positive momentum forward across the business.
Okay, moving on, just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. The company sustained strong operating results in 2015, which is consistent with the guidance we provided to you as we progressed through the year. Despite an industry that moderated during much of the year, we generated strong full-year performance, $2.1 billion in equity income and 9.5% net margins. We were able to generate these results specifically because we've been proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as optimizing mix by increasing production of our SUV demand, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost down, efficiency up initiatives and working proactively with our dealers to manage inventory levels. Although we're encouraged that China's cut in the purchase tax has provided a tailwind to the industry, our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of our business. For the year, we expect the industry in China to grow in the mid-single digit range, which will support our efforts to sustain our strong operating performance. 
With regard to North America, clearly the region posted some impressive numbers for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $2.8 billion and 10%, respectively, again both Q4 records. For the year, we achieved EBIT-adjusted of $11 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.3%, both establishing full-year records for the region. Obviously, achieving the 10% margin was a great accomplishment, especially one year ahead of our long-standing 2016 commitment.
The strong performance in North America for GM as well as the industry in general has sparked a debate whether the U.S. industry is peaking or plateauing. The Bears are industry in the U.S. has peaked and is ready to roll over. They often cite the fact that the U.S. auto industry is in its seventh year of expansion, margins are as good as they get and a recession is right around the corner. Really, more akin to a [indiscernible] that we saw in 2007. 
On the other hand, a number of people, including GM, believe the industry is plateauing, with many years of strong performance ahead, similar to the 2000 to 2007 timeframe after the industry peaked in 2000. We believe industry fundamentals such as the age of the vehicle fleet, firm used car pricing, credit availability and low fuel prices remain supportive. And overall car manufacturers are in much better health, lower inventory levels, lower breakeven points, strong capacity utilization. In addition, household balance sheets are strong, the labor market continues to improve and forecasts are calling for the U.S. economy to continue its expansion, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Combining strong industry fundamentals with the positive economic backdrop gives us confidence the industry can sustain a strong SAAR in the mid-17 million unit range for a number of years. 
With that said, we are also very aware the downturns are difficult to predict, that is why we are planning and running the business accordingly, in essence proactively managing the cycle. So what have we done? Over the past number of years, we have maintained our intense focus on cost efficiency and capital deployment. We have generated significant efficiencies over the past number of years, with even more expected in 2016. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we are well on our way to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvement by 2018, more than offsetting cost headwinds. We made tough decisions on capital deployment, which improves our downside protection. These decisions included exiting markets where we have no path to survival returns. Our breakeven point in the U.S. has been maintained at an industry level between 10 million and 11 million units as we've kept our fixed costs flat over the past number of years. And we refrained from chasing volume and share as we focused on profitable retail growth. 
U.S. dealer inventories have been proactively managed down. As Mary indicated, they're down over 100,000 units or 14% compared with year-end 2014. In addition, and probably an area not mentioned enough, we have a much more flexible workforce, enabling us to react to market dynamics and take cost out more aggressively compared to past cycles. 
And finally, [indiscernible] cost out of the system and looking for efficiencies are big drivers to protecting profitability in downturns, we're also executing several growth opportunities, such as GM Financial, after sales, OnStar and global Cadillac, that are somewhat independent of the vehicle cycle, fundamental to improve our quality of earnings peak to trough. We believe execution of our proactive downturn planning will enable sustained performance through the cycle.
Moving on to our outlook for 2015. Big picture, we expect to deliver profit growth, margin expansion and an increased free cash flow. This will translate into EPS adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 per share and free cash generation of about $6 billion, all consistent with the guidance we provided in mid-January. We also expect a similar cadence of earnings as we've seen in the past several years. Q1 will be seasonably weaker, Q2 and Q3 stronger and Q4 about average. With that said, important to point out that our Q1 results in North America will be impacted by approximately $250 million in restructuring costs. The restructuring is related to the negotiated attrition program with the UAW, which will lead to cost efficiencies going forward. And cash flow should also follow its normal seasonality pattern, with Q1 expected to be generally in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
To sum it up, we had a great quarter, a great 2015, and we expect to achieve even better results in 2016 based on our current view of the macroenvironment. 
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you."

And I think the key there is really, as you said, to maintain very strong discipline around inventory, aligning supply and demand. I would say the other thing that's important to note, in 2015, North America 10.3% margins with the oldest passenger car and Crossover lineup in the industry. And over the next 2 years, we will cycle through all of those products, including the Malibu that we're in the midst of launching, the Cruze, the compact crossovers, Equinox and the mid-crossovers. As we've said before, our expectations are the profitability of those vehicles will be significantly better than the vehicles that they replace and it's not all price. A significant portion of that is cost efficiency, and part of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies that we're driving. So I think that, yes, it's a more difficult dynamic for passenger cars. But with our launch cadence, we think that it's still going to be a tailwind for earnings in '16 and '17."

And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities. And the partnership we have with Lyft is very important from a short term, as I mentioned, being able to provide the short term used vehicles for Lyft drivers. One of the biggest issues I have is drivers and getting drivers and drivers that have the appropriate vehicles to participate as a Lyft driver. So that's a clear opportunity that I think will allow both to grow. But we got started talking to Lyft, we believe that, together, we first share common view of how autonomous will be enabled. And we think it will start in a ridesharing type of application because you can and really control the environment that you're doing that. So -- and we believe that what Lyft brings to the party with really understanding the demand cycle from a sharing perspective and what we can bring from a technical perspective that we can do that quickly and also do it to our standards of the highest levels of safety as we implement this new technology into the marketplace, but do it in a controlled fashion. So we do think that we have an opportunity there. Clearly, the bulk because there's a lot of interest in using electric vehicles to do that, so we think we have strength there. As it relates to Maven, as we talked about in the past, we had several pilots of Drive New York City, which we actually saw very strong acceptance due to the fact that we're going to be expanding that. And as we've mentioned also, launching into a city. And so we see these as additional opportunities that not only are that we're piloting in North America, but something that will have global appeal, also have a car-sharing activity going on with CarUnity in Europe and then what we announced in China as well. So when you take all of these collective learning, the sharing space, is allowing us to really create a platform that is going to allow us to have a relationship with the customer, however they want to, ride share, car share or very much supportive of the owner driver model. So we do think the aggressive pace that we're working on both with the Lyft and with our Maven activities is going to allow us to lead."

So it just seems you're not assuming anything too heroic on the core earnings power. I was just curious if you could maybe kind of confirm that? And also sort of directionally give us some guidance on the regional earnings for 2016 for the major buckets?"

To your first question, John, our capital allocation framework is transparent, so it's reasonably easy to figure out what we're going to do. To the extent that we generate available free cash flow in 2016, we will be buying shares as expeditiously as possible, similar to what we did in 2015. I'm not going to confirm the number. You were implying share buybacks of $3.5 billion. We will buy back whatever we can as quickly as we can based on the cash generation of the business. I would say when we looked at our guidance of 5  25 to 5 75, a significant portion of that was being driven by operating performance on a year-over-year basis, and that's what we are focused on driving. When we gave our guidance, we said improved overall EBIT, improved overall EBIT margins, which implies significant improvement year-over-year. Relative to regions, I would just say the following. Again, in the context of company, guidance and improved profitability, improved margins and improved EPS that we would expect to see sustained strong performance in North America. Clearly, that's going to be a component, a key component of that improvement, and continuing strong performance, sustained strong performance in China and our long-standing commitment of breakeven in Europe."

Clearly, at any point in time, on any given product or any given trend level, there could be some constraints. But it is not inhibiting sales. And frankly, as we were thinking about the business, we proactively took the actions to drive the inventory down, to make sure that we were well-positioned as a cyclical company for when the downturn happens, and it will happen at some point. We are not certainly not foreseeing it, but very rarely do people predict these things accurately. And just to size up what that means from a financial perspective, you know what happens in a downturn, first thing is inventory is drawn down at a dealer and then the fact the unit sales kind of catch up with the SAAR levels. By really focusing on efficiency and inventory and taking these 800 [ph] or 100,000 units out and maintaining that discipline, that's worth about $1 billion of downside protection from an earnings and cash flow perspective versus where we were in the 2014.

So first, the $300 million kind of reversal of the supplemental unemployment benefit is included in there as well as the absence of a $200 million gain that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 on a supplier recovery. There's also a negative $100 million associated with the lump sums that we paid to retirees based on the UAW agreement. There are some warranty adjustments associated with base vehicle warranty adjustments and those are all pluses and minuses in any quarter.

So we're about, I don't know, $2.5 billion against $5.5 billion, a little bit more than 40% of the way through the year. And we expect to make another significant step in 2016. And that also suggests that, that was our first run at this. We continue to look very hard across our entire cost structure, including globally benchmarking manufacturing costs, SG&A costs with external sources. So I wouldn't be surprised if that $5.5 billion doesn't change over time as we work our way through the next couple of years."

To me, South America breakeven, ultimately profitability there, is totally contingent upon a macro improvement. And I think that's a little bit different than the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia. We are in the midst of executing a number of restructurings. As you know, Australia manufacturing, reducing our manufacturing presence in Thailand and Indonesia. But as I've said in the past, one of the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia is the product portfolio, the brand help and the dealer network need to also improve. So that's going to be a longer tail to address all of those issues. So clearly, we're going to invest only where we can make a viable return over time. We are taking the actions in consolidated operations to position the business for that. I just don't see breakeven in the near term.

And clearly, as we think about productivity, other efficiencies that we are driving through operational excellence and everything else, our expectations are that we're going to not only offset, I would suggest, work to more than offset the incremental impact of the UAW during which at the end of the day means no impact to our 10% margin. The other important thing is we do have more flexibility associated with the UAW agreement, which improves our downside protection going forward because we can react much quicker to the market. So overall, relatively immaterial economic impact in the context of the overall GM North American results."

But with that said, January sales, the industry was up 10% year-over-year and we were up 12% year-over-year based on preliminary numbers. So it appears that we are starting the year off reasonably well given the slower growth in China. We grew share in China in 2015 because we launched the number of great products, especially in segments that we have been underrepresented. And that includes crossovers and SUVs, both at SGM and SGMW. The Baojun brand grew hundreds of percentage points of sales on a year-over-year basis. And if memory serves, we sold just under 500,000 in 2015 versus something less than 200,000 in 2014. And we have 13 products that we are launching across China in 2016, including Cadillac locally produced XT5 and other crossovers.

But every time we build flexibility, there's incremental investments to do that from a perspective, so you want to do that as efficiently as possible. I think again starting with your initial question, over the next number of years, it's likely that there is a more of a permanent shift from passenger cars to crossovers. And that's great for us. We have very strong portfolio and a very strong franchise when you think about both compact, small and, importantly, medium crossovers. And we're going through an entire launch cadence on that. That has been factored into our thinking. That's factored into our thinking when we deploy capital, factored into our tooling rates and the plans and everything else. And we have taken a number of actions when you think about the current strength of crossovers to get incremental production for instance with the Equinox and [indiscernible] the last 2 or 3 years, we built we started to flex spring hills and are sure to support our production in Camey, so we are constantly looking at the optimization of our production footprint vis-à-vis where the market's going over long period of time.

I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT-adjusted margin. 
To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue of -- was $39.6 billion. EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion was up $400 million year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin of 7% was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.39 was up 17% over last year. And for the year, we generated record net income of $9.7 billion and record EBIT-adjusted of $10.8 billion. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted increased 65% to $5.02. And our 27.2% ROIC for 2015 demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation framework is paying off. 
Our record operating performance enabled us to return approximately $5.7 billion to our owners during 2015. This significant capital return demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value over time. 
I'd like to share a little progress of what we're doing as we lead the transformation of personal mobility and also what we're doing to strengthen our core business. We gained considerable momentum in the fourth quarter and early this year on game-changing personal mobility initiative. 
First, let's talk about ridesharing. Our announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant, because we believe together we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else. We also believe, in the short term, the arrangement that we have with Lyft will allow us to capitalize on providing and being a preferred provider for short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers that will support not only General Motors performance but also Lyft performance. 
When we look in China, we've also introduced a carpooling pilot for 700 employees in Shanghai, and this is driven by a mobile app. And if we recall what we talked about in October, having that interface and the connection through a smart device is very important, and we continue to build on that capability. 
As we look at car-sharing programs, we are doing a number of things that are really leveraging our connectivity leadership based on 2 decades of OnStar technology. First, we created Maven, and that really brings together many of the pilots that are actually transforming from pilots into projects that we are replicating across different cities that allows us to have a single brand that we put all -- pull all that together. We've also made sure that we have the experts not only from ridesharing and car-sharing experiences outside the company, we've brought them in, but also connecting to the individuals in the company that understand the connected car. And acquiring Sidecar's technology and assets is another proof point there as several of its employees have joined the Maven team along with having access to that technology. 
In electrification front, we expanded our EV leadership as we unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV at CES. This is a vehicle that we plan on producing by year end. And for the second generation, the 2016 Volt won the Green Car of the Year award, and that vehicle will be shipping shortly. 
And as we look at fuel cells, a longer-range technology, we now have a program with the U.S. Army, where we're developing an extreme off-road hydrogen fuel cell Chevrolet Colorado that will allow us to test our latest technology in military duty type cycles. So again very important.
In addition to the work that we're doing in the transformation of personal mobility, we also continue to work on strengthening our core business. Last year, GM posted its third consecutive year of record sales, and we were #1 in North America, South America and China, demonstrating our commitment to our brands and our commitment to earning customers for life. In particular, we strengthened our global Chevrolet and Cadillac brands last year. In the U.S., Chevrolet grew retail market share faster than any other full line brand in the industry, up by 0.4 percentage points. And our full year global Cadillac sales are up 8%. And in China, it was a record 17%. 
In North America, we continue to be very disciplined in our sales approach and it's paying off. We had record ATPs and the best retail and total sales since 2007. GM's 2015 retail sales are up 8% over 2014. Our average GM ATPs of more than $34,600 exceed the industry average by $4,000. Our year-end total inventory was down more than 100,000 units or 14%, which is the lowest in 4 years. And in that 61 days, our 2015  year-end supply was the lowest in 6 years. 
And we're also very pleased with the early signs and feedback that we're getting on the Chevrolet Malibu, again a very important vehicle that we're launching in January with a positive -- with very positive signal of how that car is going to be received into the marketplace. 
In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall saw improved full year sales and market share for the third straight year.  In China, GM posted record sales of 3.6 million vehicles, up 5% year-over-year, and we outpaced the industry on the strong mix of SUVs, MPVs and luxury vehicles. And just a couple of data points there. We achieved record overall market share of 14.9%, including more than 50% of the MPV segment. And for SUVs, our sales rose 144%, which was led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. 
And at GM Financial, we continue to make strides toward full captive capability. In 2015, 1 in every 3 of GM's retail sales was financed by GMF, and this was up from 1 in 10 just a year ago. 
We are well on our way of achieving the $5.5 billion in cost efficiency also that we talked about and we plan to do this by 2018. And we expect that these savings will more than offset the additional investments we're making in our brands and in the technology that we need to not only be compliant but to lead in the industry. 
In 2015, we had more than $2 billion in savings in nonraw material and logistics, ahead of the commitment and twice of what we achieved in 2014. As we move into 2016, we expect another year of positive performance from material and logistics standpoint. And I also want to add, we're doing it the right way with working and strengthening the relationship with many of our key suppliers. We'll also continue to leverage and drive efficiencies through using our operational excellence, which is built on Six Sigma, our Global Business Services and the IT transformation. Because of our 2015 performance and our expectations that we will sustain strong margins in the U.S. and China and break even in Europe this year, we already announced just last month that we had increased our projected 2016 earnings per share adjusted to between $5.25 and $5.75.
Before I close the -- my initial comments, I also want to comment that we know there's been a lot written about the U.S. industry being at peak levels and that a downturn is imminent. We, like many others, do not share this view. Chuck is going to go into a little bit more detail on this, but we believe the industry fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry. Having said that, we understand that we are in a cyclical business and it's very difficult for anyone to predict the timing of a downturn. And while we feel we are very well positioned to take advantage of the strong market with important new product launches, we also have an intense focus on both cost and capital efficiencies to ensure that we will maximize earnings and cash flow through the cycle and are best prepared for whenever a downturn does occur. 
So in summary, we delivered our 2015 commitments despite a number of unforeseen headwinds, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 target across key financial metrics. And we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth that will continue to drive shareholder value. We know we're in the midst of an industry that is being disruptive, and we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and our global resources to lead that disruption. We'll continue to strengthen our core business, and we'll also continue to invest in game-changers that are necessary for GM to lead the future of personal mobility. This team is committed to delivering results. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and 2015, and that is exactly what we plan to do in 2016 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."

I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of",1364,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of key financial metrics, such as net income, consolidated EBIT-adjusted, consolidated EBIT-adjusted margin, North American EBIT-adjusted and North American EBIT-adjusted margins established records not only for the fourth quarter, but also for the full year. 
From an operating perspective, EBIT-adjusted results for the year grew to a record $10.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus 2014, adjusting 2014 from the impact of recalls. The EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.1% is up 110 basis points year-over-year on the same basis. And our adjusted earnings per share for 2015 was up 65% to $5.02, another record compared with 2014, or up 22% year-over-year after adjusting 2014 for recalls. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvements during the year. Clearly, this team is committed to delivering on improving the company's profitability going forward. 
The strong earnings growth enabled significant capital returns to our owners as well, $5.7 billion in total between dividends and share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter, and ultimately, the year was adversely impacted by cash settlements for various litigation settlements, increased capital spending and UAW ratification bonuses. With that said, we are still very much on track for a significant increase in free cash flow in 2016. And I'll talk more about 2016 in just a couple of minutes.
Although we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2015, we continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business to ensure the positive momentum continues. As Mary mentioned, we expect to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. We expect these savings will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building and technology-related costs. All these cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, a corporate initiative which will drive common tools, common processes, but most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization. The GM team is very focused on carrying our positive momentum forward across the business.
Okay, moving on, just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. The company sustained strong operating results in 2015, which is consistent with the guidance we provided to you as we progressed through the year. Despite an industry that moderated during much of the year, we generated strong full year performance, $2.1 billion in equity income and 9.5% net margins. We were able to generate these results specifically, because we've been proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as optimizing mix by increasing production of our SUV demand, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost down, efficiency up initiatives and working proactively with our dealers to manage inventory levels. Although we're encouraged that China's cut in the purchase tax has provided a tailwind to the industry, our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of our business. For the year, we expect the industry in China to grow in the mid-single-digit range, which will support our efforts to sustain our strong operating performance. 
With regard to North America, clearly, the region posted some impressive numbers for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $2.8 billion and 10%, respectively, again both Q4 records. For the year, we achieved EBIT-adjusted of $11 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.3%, both establishing full year records for the region. Obviously, achieving the 10% margin was a great accomplishment, especially 1 year ahead of our longstanding 2016 commitment.
The strong performance in North America for GM as well as the industry in general has sparked a debate whether the U.S. industry is peaking or plateauing. The Bears are of the view that industry in the U.S. has peaked and is ready to roll over. They often cite the fact that the U.S. auto industry is in its seventh year of expansion, margins are as good as they get and a recession is right around the corner, really more akin to a scenario that we saw in 2007. 
On the other hand, a number of people, including GM, believe the industry is plateauing, with many years of strong performance ahead, similar to the 2000 to 2007 timeframe after the industry peaked in 2000. We believe industry fundamentals, such as the age of the vehicle fleet, firm used car pricing, credit availability and low fuel prices remain supportive. And overall car manufacturers are in much better health, lower inventory levels, lower breakeven points, strong capacity utilization. In addition, household balance sheets are strong. The labor market continues to improve. And forecasts are calling for the U.S. economy to continue its expansion, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Combining strong industry fundamentals with the positive economic backdrop gives us confidence the industry can sustain a strong SAAR in the mid-17 million unit range for a number of years. 
With that said, we are also very aware that downturns are difficult to predict. That is why we are planning and running the business accordingly, in essence, proactively managing the cycle. So what have we done? Over the past number of years, we have maintained our intense focus on cost efficiency and capital deployment. We have generated significant efficiencies over the past number of years with even more expected in 2016. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we are well on our way to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018, more than offsetting cost headwinds. We made tough decisions on capital deployment, which improves our downside protection. These decisions included exiting markets where we have no path to viable returns. Our breakeven point in the U.S. has been maintained at an industry level of between 10 million and 11 million units as we've kept our fixed costs flat over the past number of years. And we've refrained from chasing volume and share as we focus on profitable retail growth. 
U.S. dealer inventories have been proactively managed down. As Mary indicated, they're down over 100,000 units or 14% compared with year-end 2014. In addition and probably an area not mentioned enough, we have a much more flexible workforce, enabling us to react to market dynamics and take cost out more aggressively compared to the past cycles. 
And finally, although keeping cost out of the system and looking for efficiencies are big drivers to protecting profitability in downturns, we're also executing several growth opportunities, such as GM Financial, after sales, OnStar and global Cadillac, that are somewhat independent of the vehicle cycle, fundamentally to improve our quality of earnings peak-to-trough. We believe execution of our proactive downturn planning will enable sustained performance through the cycle.
Moving on to our outlook for 2015. Big picture, we expect to deliver profit growth, margin expansion and an increased free cash flow. This will translate into EPS-adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 per share and free cash generation of about $6 billion, all consistent with the guidance we provided in mid-January. We also expect a similar cadence of earnings as we've seen in the past several years. Q1 will be seasonably weaker, Q2 and Q3 stronger and Q4 about average. With that said, important to point out that our Q1 results in North America will be impacted by approximately $250 million in restructuring costs. The restructuring is related to the negotiated attrition program with the UAW, which will lead to cost efficiencies going forward. And cash flow should also follow its normal seasonality pattern, with Q1 expected to be generally in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
To sum it up, we had a great quarter, a great 2015, and we expect to achieve even better results in 2016 based on our current view of the macro environment. 
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you."

And I think the key there is really, as you said, to maintain very strong discipline around inventory, aligning supply and demand. I would say the other thing that's important to note, in 2015, North America 10.3% margins with the oldest passenger car and crossover lineup in the industry. And over the next 2 years, we will cycle through all of those products, including the Malibu that we're in the midst of launching; the Cruze; the compact crossovers, Equinox, Terrain; and the mid-crossovers. As we've said before, our expectations are the profitability of those vehicles will be significantly better than the vehicles that they replace, and it's not all price. A significant portion of that is cost efficiency and part of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies that we're driving. So I think that, yes, it's a more difficult dynamic for passenger cars. But with our launch cadence, we think that, that is still going to be a tailwind for earnings in '16 and '17."

And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities.

And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities. And the partnership we have with Lyft is very important from a short term, as I mentioned, of being able to provide the short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers. One of the biggest issues they have is drivers -- in getting drivers. It's drivers that have the appropriate vehicles to participate as a Lyft driver. So that's a clear opportunity that I think will allow us both to grow. But when we got started talking to Lyft, we believe that together, we first share a common view of how autonomous will be enabled. And we think it will start in a ridesharing type of application, because you can ring sense it and really control the environment that you're doing at. So -- and we believe that what Lyft brings to the party with really understanding the demand cycle from a sharing perspective and what we can bring from a technical perspective that we can do that quickly and also do it to our standards of the highest levels of safety as we implement this new technology into the marketplace, but do it in a controlled fashion. So we do think that we have an opportunity there. Clearly, the bulk plays into it, because there's a lot of interest in using electric vehicles to do that. So we think we have strength there. As it relates to Maven, as we've talked about in the past, we had several pilots of Drive New York City, which we actually saw very strong acceptance due to the fact that we're going to be expanding that, and as we've mentioned also, launching into a city. And so we see these as additional opportunities that not only are -- getting more piloting in North America, but something that will have global appeal, also have a car-sharing activity going on with CarUnity in Europe and then what we announced in China as well. So when you take all this collective learning, what it -- and the sharing space, it's allowing us to really create a platform that is going to allow us to have a relationship with the customer however they want to, rideshare, car-share or still very much supportive of the owner-driver model. So we do think the aggressive pace that we're working on both with Lyft and with our Maven activities is going to allow us to lead."

And I was just curious if you could maybe kind of confirm that and also sort of directionally give us some guidance on the regional earnings for 2016 for the major buckets?"

You were implying share buybacks of $3.5 billion. We will buy back whatever we can as quickly as we can based on the cash generation of the business. I would say, when we looked at our guidance of $5.25 to $5.75, a significant portion of that was being driven by operating performance on a year-over-year basis, and that's what we're focused on driving. When we gave our guidance, we said improved overall EBIT, improved overall EBIT margins, which implies, in my view, a significant improvement year-over-year. Relative to regions, I would just say the following. Again, in the context of company, guidance and improved profitability, improved margins and improved EPS that we would expect to see sustained strong performance in North America. Clearly, that's going to be a component -- a key component of that improvement, and continuing strong performance, sustained strong performance in China and our longstanding commitment of breakeven in Europe."

I think we're reasonably comfortable with inventory levels kind of across the board. Clearly, at any point in time, on any given product or any given trend level, there could be some constraints, but it is not inhibiting sales. And frankly, as we were thinking about the business, we proactively took the actions to drive the inventory down, to make sure that we were well positioned as a cyclical company for when the downturn happens, and it will happen at some point. We are not certainly not foreseeing it, but very rarely do people predict these things accurately. And just to size up what that means from a financial perspective, you know what happens in a downturn. First thing is inventory is drawn down at a dealer and then the fact that unit sales kind of catch up with the SAAR levels. By really focusing on efficiency in inventory and taking these 800 -- or 100,000 units out and maintaining that discipline, that's worth about $1 billion of downside protection from the earnings and cash flow perspective versus where we were at the end of 2014. So another example of a proactive action that we've taken."

Specific to the -- and I presume that you're talking about the $400 million call-out box for other. There are a lot of moving pieces in there. So yes, first, the $300 million kind of reversal of the supplemental unemployment benefit is included in there as well as the absence of a $200 million gain that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 on a supplier recovery. There's also a negative $100 million associated with the lump sums that we paid to retirees based on the UAW agreement. There are some warranty adjustments associated with base vehicle warranty adjustments, and those are always pluses and minuses in any quarter. There are some incremental D&A and then a lot of miscellaneous items. But I think the big picture is -- Dan, is very, very focused on maintaining our fixed cost structure.

When you talk about the products and the strength of the products that we have down there, they're performing very well when you talk about the brand and when you talk about the dealer network and then overlay on that the restructuring and other actions we've taken. To me, South America breakeven. Ultimately, profitability there is totally contingent upon a macro improvement. And I think that's a little bit different than the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia. We are in the midst of executing a number of restructurings. As you know, Australia manufacturing take -- reducing our manufacturing presence in Thailand and Indonesia. But as I've said in the past, one of the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia is the product portfolio, the brand health and the dealer network need to also improve. So that was going to be a longer tail to address all of those issues. So clearly, we're going to invest only where we can make a viable return over time. We're taking the actions in consolidated operations to position the business for that. I just don't see breakeven in the near term. That's more of a longer-term issue and those operations that we're participating in the markets that we are participating in."

And clearly, as we think about productivity, other efficiencies that we're driving through operations excellence and everything else, our expectations are that we're going to not only offset, I would suggest, work to more than offset the incremental impact of the UAW agreement, which at the end of the day means no impact to our 10% margin. The other important thing is we do have more flexibility associated with the UAW agreement, which improves our downside protection going forward, because we can react much quicker to the market. So overall, relatively immaterial economic impact in the context of the overall GM North American results."

On Slide 27, you talk about increasing market share in China. And that compares to the narrative earlier in 2015, right, that the domestic Chinese manufacturers were gaining market share at the expense of some of the foreign JVs, maybe because they had greater availability of crossover utility vehicles or strengthened Tier 4 cities relatively.

Generally, Q4 is a pretty strong sales month in China. That seasonally -- there was a lot of launches, as we said. There's a lot of promotions in Q4. If you look at the margins in China not just for us, but the industry over the last 3 years, Q4, they have a tendency to moderate a bit just because of that. But with that said, January sales, the industry was up 10% year-over-year and we were up 12% year-over-year based on preliminary numbers. So it appears that we're starting the year off reasonably well, given the slower growth in China. We grew share in China in 2015, because we launched the number of great products, especially in segments that we had been underrepresented, and that includes crossovers and SUVs both at SGM and SGMW. The Baojun brand grew hundreds of percentage points of sales on a year-over-year basis. And if memory serves, we sold just under 500,000 in 2015 versus something less than 200,000 in 2014. And we have 13 products that we're launching across China in 2016, including Cadillac, locally produced XT5s and other crossovers. So great products, strong brands, especially Buick Wolverine, growing brands like Baojun and Cadillac gives us confidence that we'll be able to grow share again in '16 versus '15."

And clearly, we try to build as much flexibility as possible into manufacturing. But every time we build flexibility, there's incremental investments to do that from a tooling perspective. So you want to do that as efficiently as possible. I think again starting with your initial question, over the next number of years, it's likely that there is a more of a permanent shift from passenger cars to crossovers, and that's great for us. We have very strong portfolio and a very strong franchise when you think about both compact, small, and importantly, medium crossovers. And we're going through an entire launch cadence on that. That has been factored into our thinking. It's factored into our thinking when we deploy capital, factored into our tooling rates in the plants and everything else. And we have taken a number of actions when you think about the current strength of crossovers to get incremental production, for instance, with the Equinox and Terrain for the last 2 or 3 years. We've built -- we started to flex actively in Spring Hill, in Oshawa to support our production in CAMI. So we're constantly looking at the optimization of our production footprint vis-à-vis where the market is going over a long period of time. But I think you're right that ultimately there will be a permanent shift just because crossovers and SUVs are exactly what the name implies, much more utility than the traditional passenger cars."

I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT-adjusted margin. 
To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue of -- was $39.6 billion. EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion was up $400 million year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin of 7% was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.39 was up 17% over last year. And for the year, we generated record net income of $9.7 billion and record EBIT-adjusted of $10.8 billion. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted increased 65% to $5.02. And our 27.2% ROIC for 2015 demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation framework is paying off. 
Our record operating performance enabled us to return approximately $5.7 billion to our owners during 2015. This significant capital return demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value over time. 
I'd like to share a little progress of what we're doing as we lead the transformation of personal  mobility and also what we're doing to strengthen our core business. We gained considerable momentum in the fourth quarter and early this year on game-changing personal mobility initiative. 
First, let's talk about ridesharing. Our announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant because we believe, together, we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else. We also believe, in the short term, the arrangement that we have with Lyft will allow us to capitalize on providing and being a preferred provider for short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers that will support not only General Motors performance, but also Lyft performance. 
When we look in China, we've also introduced a carpooling pilot for 700 employees in Shanghai, and this is driven by a mobile app. And if we recall what we talked about in October, having that interface and the connection through a smart device is very important, and we continue to build on that capability. 
As we look at car-sharing programs, we are doing a number of things that are really leveraging our connectivity leadership based on 2 decades of OnStar technology. First, we created Maven, and that really brings together many of the pilots that are actually transforming from pilots into projects that we are replicating across different cities that allows us to have a single brand that we put all -- pull all that together. We've also made sure that we have the experts not only from ridesharing and car-sharing experiences outside the company, we've brought them in, but also connecting to the individuals in the company that understand the connected car. And acquiring Sidecar's technology and assets is another proof point there as several of its employees have joined the Maven team, along with having access to that technology. 
And on an electrification front, we expanded our EV leadership as we unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV at CES. This is a vehicle that we plan on producing by year end. And for the second generation, the 2016 Volt won the Green Car Journal of the Year award, and that vehicle will be shipping shortly. 
And as we look at fuel cells, a longer-range technology, we now have a program with the U.S. Army, where we're developing an extreme off-road hydrogen fuel cell Chevrolet Colorado that will allow us to test our latest technology in military duty type cycles. So again, very important.
In addition to the work that we're doing in the transformation of personal mobility, we also continue to work on strengthening our core business. Last year, GM posted its third consecutive year of record sales, and we were #1 in North America, South America and China, demonstrating our commitment to our brands and our commitment to earning customers for life. In particular, we strengthened our global Chevrolet and Cadillac brands last year. In the U.S., Chevrolet grew retail market share faster than any other full line brand in the industry, up by 0.4 percentage points. And our full year global Cadillac sales are up 8%. And in China, it was a record 17%. 
In North America, we continue to be very disciplined in our sales approach, and it's paying off. We had record ATPs and the best retail and total sales since 2007. GM's 2015 retail sales are up 8% over 2014. Our average GM ATPs of more than $34,600 exceed the industry average by $4,000. Our year-end total inventory was down more than 100,000 units or 14%, which is the lowest in 4 years. And in that 61 days, our 2015  year-end supply was the lowest in 6 years. 
And we're also very pleased with the early signs and feedback that we're getting on the Chevrolet Malibu, again a very important vehicle that we're launching in January with a positive -- with very positive signal of how that car is going to be received into the marketplace. 
In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall saw improved full year sales and market share for the third straight year.  In China, GM posted record sales of 3.6 million vehicles, up 5% year-over-year, and we outpaced the industry on the strong mix of SUVs, MPVs and luxury vehicles. And just a couple of data points there. We achieved record overall market share of 14.9%, including more than 50% of the MPV segment. And for SUVs, our sales rose 144%, which was led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. 
And at GM Financial, we continue to make strides toward full captive capability. In 2015, 1 in every 3 of GM's retail sales was financed by GMF, and this was up from 1 in 10 just a year ago. 
We are well on our way of achieving the $5.5 billion in cost efficiency also that we talked about, and we plan to do this by 2018. And we expect that these savings will more than offset the additional investments we're making in our brands and in the technology that we need to not only be compliant, but to lead in the industry. 
In 2015, we had more than $2 billion in savings in nonraw material and logistics, ahead of the commitment and twice of what we achieved in 2014. As we move into 2016, we expect another year of positive performance from material and logistics standpoint. And I also want to add, we're doing it the right way with working and strengthening the relationship with many of our key suppliers. We'll also continue to leverage and drive efficiencies through using our operational excellence, which is built on Six Sigma, our Global Business Services and the IT transformation. Because of our 2015 performance and our expectations that we will sustain strong margins in the U.S. and China and break even in Europe this year, we already announced just last month that we had increased our projected 2016 earnings per share adjusted to between $5.25 and $5.75.
Before I close the -- my initial comments, I also want to comment that we know there's been a lot written about the U.S. industry being at peak levels and that a downturn is imminent. We, like many others, do not share this view. Chuck is going to go into a little bit more detail on this, but we believe the industry fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry. Having said that, we understand that we are in a cyclical business, and it's very difficult for anyone to predict the timing of a downturn. And while we feel we are very well positioned to take advantage of the strong market with important new product launches, we also have an intense focus on both cost and capital efficiencies to ensure that we will maximize earnings and cash flow through the cycle and are best prepared for whenever a downturn does occur. 
So in summary, we delivered our 2015 commitments despite a number of unforeseen headwinds, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 targets across key financial metrics. And we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth that will continue to drive shareholder value. We know we're in the midst of an industry that is being disruptive, and we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and our global resources to lead that disruption. We'll continue to strengthen our core business, and we'll also continue to invest in game-changers that are necessary for GM to lead the future of personal mobility. This team is committed to delivering results. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and 2015, and that is exactly what we plan to do in 2016 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."

From an operating perspective, EBIT-adjusted results for the year grew to a record $10.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus 2014, adjusting 2014 for the impact of recalls. The EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.1% is up 110 basis points year-over-year on the same basis. And our adjusted earnings per share for 2015 was up 65% to $5.02, another record compared with 2014, or up 22% year-over-year after adjusting 2014 for recalls. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvements during the year. Clearly, this team is committed to delivering on improving the company's profitability going forward. 
The strong earnings growth enabled significant capital returns to our owners as well, $5.7 billion in total between dividends and share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter, and ultimately, the year was adversely impacted by cash settlements for various litigation settlements, increased capital spending and UAW ratification bonuses. With that said, we are still very much on track for a significant increase in free cash flow in 2016. And I'll talk more about 2016 in just a couple of minutes.
Although we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2015, we continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business to ensure the positive momentum continues. As Mary mentioned, we expect to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. We expect these savings will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building and technology-related costs. All these cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, a corporate initiative which will drive common tools, common processes, but most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization. The GM team is very focused on carrying our positive momentum forward across the business.
Okay, moving on, just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. The company sustained strong operating results in 2015, which is consistent with the guidance we provided to you as we progressed through the year. Despite an industry that moderated during much of the year, we generated strong full year performance, $2.1 billion in equity income and 9.5% net margins. We were able to generate these results specifically because we've been proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as optimizing mix by increasing production of our SUVs in demand, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost down/efficiency up initiatives and working proactively with our dealers to manage inventory levels. Although we're encouraged that China's cut in the purchase tax has provided a tailwind to the industry, our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of our business. For the year, we expect the industry in China to grow in the mid-single-digit range, which will support our efforts to sustain our strong operating performance. 
With regard to North America, clearly, the region posted some impressive numbers for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $2.8 billion and 10%, respectively, again both Q4 records. For the year, we achieved EBIT-adjusted of $11 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.3%, both establishing full year records for the region. Obviously, achieving the 10% margin was a great accomplishment, especially 1 year ahead of our longstanding 2016 commitment.
The strong performance in North America for GM as well as the industry in general has sparked a debate whether the U.S. industry is peaking or plateauing. The bears argue that industry in the U.S. has peaked, and is ready to roll over. They often cite the fact that the U.S. auto industry is in its seventh year of expansion, margins are as good as they get and a recession is right around the corner, really more akin to a scenario that we saw in 2007. 
On the other hand, a number of people, including GM, believe the industry is plateauing, with many years of strong performance ahead, similar to the 2000 to 2007 timeframe after the industry peaked in 2000. We believe industry fundamentals, such as the age of the vehicle fleet, firm used car pricing, credit availability and low fuel prices remain supportive. And overall car manufacturers are in much better health, lower inventory levels, lower breakeven points, strong capacity utilization. In addition, household balance sheets are strong. The labor market continues to improve. And forecasts are calling for the U.S. economy to continue its expansion, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Combining strong industry fundamentals with the positive economic backdrop gives us confidence the industry can sustain a strong SAAR in the mid-17 million unit range for a number of years. 
With that said, we are also very aware that downturns are difficult to predict. That is why we are planning and running the business accordingly, in essence, proactively managing the cycle. So what have we done? Over the past number of years, we have maintained our intense focus on cost efficiency and capital deployment. We have generated significant efficiencies over the past number of years with even more expected in 2016. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we are well on our way to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018, more than offsetting cost headwinds. We've made tough decisions on capital deployment, which improves our downside protection. These decisions included exiting markets where we have no path to viable returns. Our breakeven point in the U.S. has been maintained at an industry level of between 10 million and 11 million units, as we've kept our fixed costs flat over the past number of years. And we've refrained from chasing volume and share as we focus on profitable retail growth. 
U.S. dealer inventories have been proactively managed down. As Mary indicated, they're down over 100,000 units or 14% compared with year-end 2014. In addition and probably an area not mentioned enough, we have a much more flexible workforce, enabling us to react to market dynamics and take cost out more aggressively compared with past cycles. 
And finally, although keeping cost out of the system and looking for efficiencies are big drivers to protecting profitability in downturns, we're also executing several growth opportunities, such as GM Financial, after sales, OnStar and global Cadillac, that are somewhat independent of the vehicle cycle, fundamentally to improve our quality of earnings peak-to-trough. We believe execution of our proactive downturn planning will enable sustained performance through the cycle.
Moving on to our outlook for 2015. Big picture, we expect to deliver profit growth, margin expansion and an increased free cash flow. This will translate into EPS-adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 per share and free cash generation of about $6 billion, all consistent with the guidance we provided in mid-January. We'd also expect a similar cadence of earnings as we've seen in the past several years. Q1 will be seasonably weaker, Q2 and Q3 stronger and Q4 about average. With that said, important to point out that our Q1 results in North America will be impacted by approximately $250 million in restructuring costs. The restructuring is related to the negotiated attrition program with the UAW, which will lead to cost efficiencies going forward. And cash flow should also follow its normal seasonality pattern, with Q1 expected to be generally in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
To sum it up, we had a great quarter, a great 2015, and we expect to achieve even better results in 2016 based on our current view of the macro environment. 
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you."

And I think the key there is really, as you said, to maintain very strong discipline around inventory, aligning supply and demand. I would say the other thing that's important to note, in 2015, North America 10.3% margins with the oldest passenger car and crossover lineup in the industry. And over the next 2 years, we will cycle through all of those products, including the Malibu that we're in the midst of launching; the Cruze; the compact crossovers, the Equinox, Terrain; and the mid-crossovers. As we've said before, our expectations are the profitability of those vehicles will be significantly better than the vehicles that they replace, and it's not all price. A significant portion of that is cost efficiency and part of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies that we're driving. So I think that, yes, it's a more difficult dynamic for passenger cars. But with our launch cadence, we think that, that is still going to be a tailwind for earnings in '16 and '17."

And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities. And the partnership we have with Lyft is very important from a short term, as I mentioned, of being able to provide the short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers. One of the biggest issues they have is drivers -- in getting drivers. It's drivers that have the appropriate vehicles to participate as a Lyft driver. So that's a clear opportunity that I think will allow us both to grow. But when we got started talking to Lyft, we believe that together, we first share a common view of how autonomous will be enabled. And we think it will start in a ridesharing type of application because you can ring sense it and really control the environment that you're doing that. So -- and we believe that what Lyft brings to the party with really understanding the demand cycle from a sharing perspective and what we can bring from a technical perspective that we can do that quickly and also do it to our standards of the highest levels of safety as we implement this new technology into the marketplace, but do it in a controlled fashion. So we do think that we have an opportunity there. Clearly, the Bolt plays into it because there's a lot of interest in using electric vehicles to do that. So we think we have strength there. As it relates to Maven, as we've talked about in the past, we've had several pilots of Drive New York City, which we actually saw very strong acceptance due to the fact that we're going to be expanding that, and as we've mentioned also, launching into a city. And so we see these as additional opportunities that not only are -- again, we're piloting in North America, but something that will have global appeal, also have a car-sharing activity going on with CarUnity in Europe and then what we announced in China as well. So when you take all this collective learning, what it -- and the sharing space, it's allowing us to really create a platform that is going to allow us to have a relationship with the customer however they want to, rideshare, car-share or still very much supportive of the owner-driver model. So we do think the aggressive pace that we're working on -- both with Lyft and with our Maven activities is going to allow us to lead."

We are not -- certainly not foreseeing it, but very rarely do people predict these things accurately. And just to size up what that means from a financial perspective, you know what happens in a downturn. First thing is inventory is drawn down at a dealer and then the factory unit sales kind of catch up with the SAAR levels. By really focusing on efficiency in inventory and taking these 800 -- or 100,000 units out and maintaining that discipline, that's worth about $1 billion of downside protection from an earnings and cash flow perspective versus where we were at the end of 2014.

There will always be noise year-over-year on variable-type fixed costs, like incentive compensation and things like that, but fundamentally, the core fixed costs flat year-over-year. Specific to the -- and I presume that you're talking about the $400 million call-out box for other. There are a lot of moving pieces in there. So yes, first, the $300 million kind of reversal of the supplemental unemployment benefit is included in there as well as the absence of a $200 million gain that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 on a supplier recovery. There's also a negative $100 million associated with the lump sums that we paid to retirees based on the UAW agreement. There are some warranty adjustments associated with base vehicle warranty adjustments, and those are always pluses and minuses in any quarter. There are some incremental D&A and then a lot of miscellaneous items. But I think the big picture is -- Dan, is very, very focused on maintaining our fixed cost structure.

The agreement that we have with UAW most definitely will not impede our 10% margins in North America. And again, step back and think about our U.S. hourly workforce cost in the U.S.; it's $5.5 billion. So look at that in the context of the agreement that we reached and everything else, you're talking about economics that are a couple of hundred million dollars a year. And clearly, as we think about productivity, other efficiencies that we're driving through operations excellence and everything else, our expectations are that we're going to not only offset, I would suggest, work to more than offset the incremental impact of the UAW agreement, which at the end of the day means no impact to our 10% margin. The other important thing is we do have more flexibility associated with the UAW agreement, which improves our downside protection going forward because we can react much quicker to the market. So overall, relatively immaterial economic impact in the context of the overall GM North American results."

On Slide 27, you talk about increasing market share in China. And that compares to the narrative earlier in 2015, right, that the domestic Chinese manufacturers were gaining market share at the expense of some of the foreign JVs, maybe because they had greater availability of crossover utility vehicles or strength in Tier 4 cities, relatively. So can you talk about how you were able to gain share there on a full year basis, your product cadence in China overall and specific to utilities? And then just lastly, still on China, but comment a bit, please, on the sustainability of the current run rate of sales and what your house view is on the strength in 4Q, whether that pulls from 2016 or whether that pulls from 2017 after the tax incentives expire?"

Generally, Q4 is a pretty strong sales month in China. That seasonally -- there's a lot of launches, as we said. There's a lot of promotions in Q4. If you look at the margins in China not just for us, but the industry over the last 3 years, Q4, they have a tendency to moderate a bit just because of that. But with that said, January sales, the industry was up 10% year-over-year, and we were up 12% year-over-year based on preliminary numbers. So it appears that we're starting the year off reasonably well, given the slower growth in China. We grew share in China in 2015 because we launched the number of great products, especially in segments that we had been underrepresented, and that includes crossovers and SUVs both at SGM and SGMW. The Baojun brand grew hundreds of percentage points of sales on a year-over-year basis. And if memory serves, we sold just under 500,000 in 2015 versus something less than 200,000 in 2014. And we have 13 products that we're launching across China in 2016, including Cadillac, locally produced XT5s and other crossovers. So great products, strong brands, especially Buick, Wuling, growing brands like Baojun and Cadillac gives us confidence that we'll be able to grow share again in '16 versus '15."

And clearly, we try to build as much flexibility as possible into manufacturing. But every time you build flexibility, there's incremental investments to do that from a tooling perspective. So you want to do that as efficiently as possible. I think, again, starting with your initial question, over the next number of years, it's likely that there is a more of a permanent shift from passenger cars to crossovers, and that's great for us. We have very strong portfolio and a very strong franchise when you think about both compact, small, and importantly, medium crossovers. And we're going through an entire launch cadence on that. That has been factored into our thinking. It's factored into our thinking when we deploy capital. It's factored into our tooling rates in the plants and everything else. And we have taken a number of actions, when you think about the current strength of crossovers, to get incremental production. For instance, with the Equinox and Terrain for the last 2 or 3 years, we've built -- we started a flex activity in Spring Hill, in Oshawa to support our production in CAMI. So we're constantly looking at the optimization of our production footprint vis-à-vis where the market is going over a long period of time. But I think you're right, that ultimately there will be a permanent shift just because crossovers and SUVs are exactly what the name implies, much more utility than the traditional passenger cars."

I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT-adjusted margin. 
To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue of -- was $39.6 billion. EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion was up $400 million year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin of 7% was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.39 was up 17% over last year. And for the year, we generated record net income of $9.7 billion and record EBIT-adjusted of $10.8 billion. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted increased 65% to $5.02. And our 27.2% ROIC for 2015 demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation framework is paying off. 
Our record operating performance enabled us to return approximately $5.7 billion to our owners during 2015. This significant capital return demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value over time. 
I'd like to share a little progress of what we're doing as we lead the transformation of personal  mobility and also what we're doing to strengthen our core business. We gained considerable momentum in the fourth quarter and early this year on game-changing personal mobility initiative. 
First, let's talk about ridesharing. Our announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant because we believe, together, we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else. We also believe, in the short term, the arrangement that we have with Lyft will allow us to capitalize on providing and being a preferred provider for short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers that will support not only General Motors performance, but also Lyft performance. 
When we look in China, we've also introduced a carpooling pilot for 700 employees in Shanghai, and this is driven by a mobile app. And if we recall, what we talked about in October, having that interface and the connection through a smart device is very important, and we continue to build on that capability. 
As we look at car-sharing programs, we are doing a number of things that are really leveraging our connectivity leadership based on 2 decades of OnStar technology. First, we created Maven, and that really brings together many of the pilots that are actually transforming from pilots into projects that we are replicating across different cities that allows us to have a single brand that we put all -- pull all that together. We've also made sure that we have the experts not only from ridesharing and car-sharing experiences outside the company, we've brought them in, but also connecting to the individuals in the company that understand the connected car. And acquiring Sidecar's technology and assets is another proof point there as several of its employees have joined the Maven team, along with having access to that technology. 
And on an electrification front, we expanded our EV leadership as we unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV at CES. This is a vehicle that we plan on producing by year-end. And for the second generation, the 2016 Volt won the Green Car Journal of the Year award, and that vehicle will be shipping shortly. 
And as we look at fuel cells, a longer-range technology, we now have a program with the U.S. Army, where we're developing an extreme off-road hydrogen fuel cell Chevrolet Colorado that will allow us to test our latest technology in military duty type cycles. So again, very important.
In addition to the work that we're doing in the transformation of personal mobility, we also continue to work on strengthening our core business. Last year, GM posted its third consecutive year of record sales, and we were #1 in North America, South America and China, demonstrating our commitment to our brands and our commitment to earning customers for life. In particular, we strengthened our global Chevrolet and Cadillac brands last year. In the U.S., Chevrolet grew retail market share faster than any other full line brand in the industry, up by 0.4 percentage points. And our full year global Cadillac sales are up 8%. And in China, it was a record 17%. 
In North America, we continue to be very disciplined in our sales approach, and it's paying off. We had record ATPs and the best retail and total sales since 2007. GM's 2015 retail sales are up 8% over 2014. Our average GM ATPs of more than $34,600 exceed the industry average by $4,000. Our year-end total inventory was down more than 100,000 units or 14%, which is the lowest in 4 years. And in that 61 days, our 2015  year-end supply was the lowest in 6 years. 
And we're also very pleased with the early signs and feedback that we're getting on the Chevrolet Malibu, again a very important vehicle that we're launching in January with a positive -- with very positive signal of how that car is going to be received into the marketplace. 
In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall saw improved full year sales and market share for the third straight year.  In China, GM posted record sales of 3.6 million vehicles, up 5% year-over-year, and we outpaced the industry on the strong mix of SUVs, MPVs and luxury vehicles. And just a couple of data points there. We achieved record overall market share of 14.9%, including more than 50% of the MPV segment. And for SUVs, our sales rose 144%, which was led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. 
And at GM Financial, we continue to make strides toward full captive capability. In 2015, 1 in every 3 of GM's retail sales was financed by GMF, and this was up from 1 in 10 just a year ago. 
We are well on our way of achieving the $5.5 billion in cost efficiency also that we talked about, and we plan to do this by 2018. And we expect that these savings will more than offset the additional investments we're making in our brands and in the technology that we need to not only be compliant, but to lead in the industry. 
In 2015, we had more than $2 billion in savings in nonraw material and logistics, ahead of the commitment and twice of what we achieved in 2014. As we move into 2016, we expect another year of positive performance from material and logistics standpoint. And I also want to add, we're doing it the right way with working and strengthening the relationship with many of our key suppliers. We'll also continue to leverage and drive efficiencies through using our operational excellence, which is built on Six Sigma, our Global Business Services and the IT transformation. Because of our 2015 performance and our expectations that we will sustain strong margins in the U.S. and China and break even in Europe this year, we already announced just last month that we had increased our projected 2016 earnings per share adjusted to between $5.25 and $5.75.
Before I close the -- my initial comments, I also want to comment that we know there's been a lot written about the U.S. industry being at peak levels and that a downturn is imminent. We, like many others, do not share this view. Chuck is going to go into a little bit more detail on this, but we believe the industry fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry. Having said that, we understand that we are in a cyclical business, and it's very difficult for anyone to predict the timing of a downturn. And while we feel we are very well positioned to take advantage of the strong market with important new product launches, we also have an intense focus on both cost and capital efficiencies to ensure that we will maximize earnings and cash flow through the cycle and are best prepared for whenever a downturn does occur. 
So in summary, we delivered our 2015 commitments despite a number of unforeseen headwinds, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 targets across key financial metrics. And we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth that will continue to drive shareholder value. We know we're in the midst of an industry that is being disruptive, and we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and our global resources to lead that disruption. We'll continue to strengthen our core business, and we'll also continue to invest in game changers that are necessary for GM to lead the future of personal mobility. This team is committed to delivering results. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and 2015, and that is exactly what we plan to do in 2016 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,321713294,955962,"General Motors Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of",1366,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of key financial metrics, such as net income, consolidated EBIT-adjusted, consolidated EBIT-adjusted margin, North American EBIT-adjusted and North American EBIT-adjusted margins established records not only for the fourth quarter, but also for the full year. 
From an operating perspective, EBIT-adjusted results for the year grew to a record $10.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus 2014, adjusting 2014 for the impact of recalls. The EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.1% is up 110 basis points year-over-year on the same basis. And our adjusted earnings per share for 2015 was up 65% to $5.02, another record compared with 2014, or up 22% year-over-year after adjusting 2014 for recalls. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvements during the year. Clearly, this team is committed to delivering on improving the company's profitability going forward. 
The strong earnings growth enabled significant capital returns to our owners as well, $5.7 billion in total between dividends and share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter and, ultimately, the year was adversely impacted by cash settlements for various litigation settlements, increased capital spending and UAW ratification bonuses. With that said, we are still very much on track for a significant increase in free cash flow in 2016. And I'll talk more about 2016 in just a couple of minutes.
Although we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2015, we continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business to ensure the positive momentum continues. As Mary mentioned, we expect to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. We expect these savings will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building and technology-related costs. All of these cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, a corporate initiative which will drive common tools, common processes but, most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization. The GM team is very focused on carrying our positive momentum forward across the business.
Okay, moving on, just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. The company sustained strong operating results in 2015, which is consistent with the guidance we provided to you as we progressed through the year. Despite an industry that moderated during much of the year, we generated strong full year performance, $2.1 billion in equity income and 9.5% net margins. We were able to generate these results specifically because we had been proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as optimizing mix by increasing production of our SUVs in demand, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost down-efficiency up initiatives and working proactively with our dealers to manage inventory levels. Although we're encouraged that China's cut in the purchase tax has provided a tailwind to the industry, our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of our business. For the year, we expect the industry in China to grow in the mid-single-digit range, which will support our efforts to sustain our strong operating performance. 
With regard to North America, clearly, the region posted some impressive numbers for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $2.8 billion and 10%, respectively, again both Q4 records. For the year, we achieved EBIT-adjusted of $11 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.3%, both establishing full year records for the region. Obviously, achieving the 10% margin was a great accomplishment, especially 1 year ahead of our long-standing 2016 commitment.
The strong performance in North America for GM as well as the industry in general has sparked a debate whether the U.S. industry is peaking or plateauing. The bears argue the industry in the U.S. has peaked, and is ready to roll over. They often cite the fact that the U.S. auto industry is in its seventh year of expansion, margins are as good as they get and a recession is right around the corner, really more akin to a scenario that we saw in 2007. 
On the other hand, a number of people, including GM, believe the industry is plateauing, with many years of strong performance ahead, similar to the 2000 to 2007 time frame after the industry peaked in 2000. We believe industry fundamentals, such as the age of the vehicle fleet, firm used car pricing, credit availability and low fuel prices remain supportive. And overall car manufacturers are in much better health, lower inventory levels, lower breakeven points, strong capacity utilization. In addition, household balance sheets are strong. The labor market continues to improve. And forecasts are calling for the U.S. economy to continue its expansion, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Combining strong industry fundamentals with the positive economic backdrop gives us confidence the industry can sustain a strong SAAR in the mid-17 million unit range for a number of years. 
With that said, we are also very aware that downturns are difficult to predict. That is why we are planning and running the business accordingly, in essence, proactively managing the cycle. So what have we done? Over the past number of years, we have maintained our intense focus on cost efficiency and capital deployment. We have generated significant efficiencies over the past number of years with even more expected in 2016. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we are well on our way to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018, more than offsetting cost headwinds. We've made tough decisions on capital deployment, which improves our downside protection. These decisions included exiting markets where we have no path to viable returns. Our breakeven point in the U.S. has been maintained at an industry level of between 10 million and 11 million units, as we've kept our fixed costs flat over the past number of years. And we've refrained from chasing volume and share as we focus on profitable retail growth. 
U.S. dealer inventories have been proactively managed down. As Mary indicated, they're down over 100,000 units or 14% compared with year-end 2014. In addition and probably an area not mentioned enough, we have a much more flexible workforce, enabling us to react to market dynamics and take cost out more aggressively compared with past cycles. 
And finally, although keeping cost out of the system and looking for efficiencies are big drivers to protecting profitability in downturns, we are also executing several growth opportunities, such as GM Financial, after sales, OnStar and global Cadillac, that are somewhat independent of the vehicle cycle, fundamentally to improve our quality of earnings peak to trough. We believe execution of our proactive downturn planning will enable sustained performance through the cycle.
Moving on to our outlook for 2016. Big picture, we expect to deliver profit growth, margin expansion and an increased free cash flow. This will translate into EPS-adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 per share and free cash generation of about $6 billion, all consistent with the guidance we provided in mid-January. We'd also expect a similar cadence of earnings as we've seen in the past several years. Q1 will be seasonably weaker, Q2 and Q3 stronger and Q4 about average. 
With that said, important to point out that our Q1 results in North America will be impacted by approximately $250 million in restructuring costs. The restructuring is related to the negotiated attrition program with the UAW, which will lead to cost efficiencies going forward. And cash flow should also follow its normal seasonality pattern, with Q1 expected to be generally in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
To sum it up, we had a great quarter, a great 2015, and we expect to achieve even better results in 2016 based on our current view of the macro environment. 
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you."

But I'd love to get a sense, given some of the weakness we're seeing just in car segments that's being offset by trucks, how are you seeing the production incentive discipline in car segments? I know GM has kept its inventory there pretty low. But what kind of competitive environment are you seeing and kind of modeling for and in your outlook for 2016 in those segments?"

And I think the key there is really, as you said, to maintain very strong discipline around inventory, aligning supply and demand. I would say the other thing that's important to note, in 2015, North America 10.3% margins with the oldest passenger car and crossover lineup in the industry. And over the next 2 years, we will cycle through all of those products, including the Malibu that we're in the midst of launching; the Cruze; the compact crossovers, the Equinox, Terrain; and the mid-crossovers. As we've said before, our expectations are the profitability of those vehicles will be significantly better than the vehicles that they replace, and it's not all price. A significant portion of that is cost efficiency and part of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies that we're driving. So I think that, yes, it's a more difficult dynamic for passenger cars. But with our launch cadence, we think that, that is still going to be a tailwind for earnings in '16 and '17."

And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities. And the partnership we have with Lyft is very important from a short term, as I mentioned, of being able to provide the short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers. One of the biggest issues they have is drivers -- in getting drivers, it's drivers that have the appropriate vehicles to participate as a Lyft driver. So that's a clear opportunity that I think will allow us both to grow. But when we got started talking to Lyft, we believe that together, we first share a common view of how autonomous will be enabled. And we think it will start in a ridesharing type of application because you can ring fence it in and really control the environment that you're doing that. So -- and we believe that what Lyft brings to the party with really understanding the demand cycle from a sharing perspective and what we can bring from a technical perspective that we can do that quickly and also do it to our standards of the highest levels of safety as we implement this new technology into the marketplace, but do it in a controlled fashion. So we do think that we have an opportunity there. Clearly, the Bolt plays into it because there's a lot of interest in using electric vehicles to do that. So we think we have strength there. As it relates to Maven, as we've talked about in the past, we've had several pilots of Drive New York City, which we actually saw very strong acceptance due to the fact that we're going to be expanding that, and as we've mentioned also, launching into a city. And so we see these as additional opportunities that not only are -- again, we're piloting in North America, but something that will have global appeal, also have a car-sharing activity going on with CarUnity in Europe and then what we announced in China as well. So when you take all this collective learning, what it -- and the sharing space, it's allowing us to really create a platform that is going to allow us to have a relationship with the customer however they want to, rideshare, car-share or still very much supportive of the owner-driver model. So we do think the aggressive pace that we're working on, both with Lyft and with our Maven activities, is going to allow us to lead."

Relative to regions, I would just say the following. Again, in the context of company, guidance on improved profitability, improved margins and improved EPS that we would expect to see sustained strong performance in North America.

We are not -- certainly not foreseeing it, but very rarely do people predict these things accurately. And just to size up what that means from a financial perspective, you know what happens in a downturn. First thing is inventory is drawn down at a dealer and then the factory unit sales kind of catch up with the SAAR levels. By really focusing on efficiency in inventory and taking these 800 -- or 100,000 units out and maintaining that discipline, that's worth about $1 billion of downside protection from an earnings and cash flow perspective versus where we were at the end of 2014.

As you know, Australia manufacturing take -- reducing our manufacturing presence in Thailand and Indonesia. But as I've said in the past, one of the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia is the product portfolio, the brand health and the dealer network need to also improve.

But with that said, January sales, the industry was up 10% year-over-year, and we were up 12% year-over-year based on preliminary numbers. So it appears that we're starting the year off reasonably well given the slower growth in China. We grew share in China in 2015 because we launched a number of great products, especially in segments that we had been underrepresented, and that includes crossovers and SUVs both at SGM and SGMW. The Baojun brand grew hundreds of percentage points of sales on a year-over-year basis. And if memory serves, we sold just under 500,000 in 2015 versus something less than 200,000 in 2014. And we have 13 products that we're launching across China in 2016, including Cadillac, locally produced XT5s and other crossovers.

I certainly understand that with your product launches, you're going to buck the trend a bit in terms of price. But just in terms of capacity production volumes, a, how are you thinking about that market over the next couple of years? Two, with kind of defocusing, at least in 4Q and 1Q, January on rental car sales, is that kind of related to where you think either your capacity or maybe your just retail mix is going there? And then three, just a strategic question. Since the industry has been through several light truck pivoting the passenger car back to light truck, now back to passenger car and then back to light truck cycles, how are you thinking about midterm flexibility vis-à-vis your manufacturing base? And in particular, why aren't there more factories, and it's not just you, its most of the industry, that can flex between the 2 product lines?"

And clearly, we try to build as much flexibility as possible into manufacturing. But every time you build flexibility, there's incremental investments to do that from a tooling perspective. So you want to do that as efficiently as possible. I think, again, starting with your initial question, over the next number of years, it's likely that there is a more of a permanent shift from passenger cars to crossovers, and that's great for us. We have very strong portfolio and a very strong franchise when you think about both compact, small and, importantly, medium crossovers. And we're going through an entire launch cadence on that. That has been factored into our thinking. It's factored into our thinking when we deploy capital. It's factored into our tooling rates in the plants and everything else. And we have taken a number of actions, when you think about the current strength of crossovers, to get incremental production. For instance, with the Equinox and Terrain for the last 2 or 3 years, we've built -- we started a flex activity in Spring Hill, in Oshawa to support our production in CAMI. So we're constantly looking at the optimization of our production footprint vis-à-vis where the market is going over a long period of time. But I think you're right, that ultimately there will be a permanent shift just because crossovers and SUVs are exactly what the name implies, much more utility than the traditional passenger cars."

I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT-adjusted margin. 
To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue of -- was $39.6 billion. EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion was up $400 million year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin of 7% was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.39 was up 17% over last year. And for the year, we generated record net income of $9.7 billion and record EBIT-adjusted of $10.8 billion. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted increased 65% to $5.02. And our 27.2% ROIC for 2015 demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation framework is paying off. 
Our record operating performance enabled us to return approximately $5.7 billion to our owners during 2015. This significant capital return demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value over time. 
I'd like to share a little progress of what we're doing as we lead the transformation of personal  mobility and also what we're doing to strengthen our core business. We gained considerable momentum in the fourth quarter and early this year on game-changing personal mobility initiative. 
First, let's talk about ridesharing. Our announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant because we believe, together, we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else. We also believe, in the short term, the arrangement that we have with Lyft will allow us to capitalize on providing and being a preferred provider for short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers that will support not only General Motors performance, but also Lyft performance. 
When we look in China, we've also introduced a carpooling pilot for 700 employees in Shanghai, and this is driven by a mobile app. And if we recall, what we talked about in October, having that interface and the connection through a smart device is very important, and we continue to build on that capability. 
As we look at car-sharing programs, we are doing a number of things that are really leveraging our connectivity leadership based on 2 decades of OnStar technology. First, we created Maven, and that really brings together many of the pilots that are actually transforming from pilots into projects that we are replicating across different cities that allows us to have a single brand that we put all -- pull all that together. We've also made sure that we have the experts not only from ridesharing and car-sharing experiences outside the company, we've brought them in, but also connecting to the individuals in the company that understand the connected car. And acquiring Sidecar's technology and assets is another proof point there as several of its employees have joined the Maven team, along with having access to that technology. 
And on an electrification front, we expanded our EV leadership as we unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV at CES. This is a vehicle that we plan on producing by year-end. And for the second generation, the 2016 Volt won the Green Car Journal of the Year award, and that vehicle will be shipping shortly. 
And as we look at fuel cells, a longer-range technology, we now have a program with the U.S. Army, where we're developing an extreme off-road hydrogen fuel cell Chevrolet Colorado that will allow us to test our latest technology in military duty type cycles. So again, very important.
In addition to the work that we're doing in the transformation of personal mobility, we also continue to work on strengthening our core business. Last year, GM posted its third consecutive year of record sales, and we were #1 in North America, South America and China, demonstrating our commitment to our brands and our commitment to earning customers for life. In particular, we strengthened our global Chevrolet and Cadillac brands last year. In the U.S., Chevrolet grew retail market share faster than any other full line brand in the industry, up by 0.4 percentage points. And our full year global Cadillac sales are up 8%. And in China, it was a record 17%. 
In North America, we continue to be very disciplined in our sales approach, and it's paying off. We had record ATPs and the best retail and total sales since 2007. GM's 2015 retail sales are up 8% over 2014. Our average GM ATPs of more than $34,600 exceed the industry average by $4,000. Our year-end total inventory was down more than 100,000 units or 14%, which is the lowest in 4 years. And in that 61 days, our 2015  year-end supply was the lowest in 6 years. 
And we're also very pleased with the early signs and feedback that we're getting on the Chevrolet Malibu, again a very important vehicle that we're launching in January with a positive -- with very positive signal of how that car is going to be received into the marketplace. 
In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall saw improved full year sales and market share for the third straight year.  In China, GM posted record sales of 3.6 million vehicles, up 5% year-over-year, and we outpaced the industry on the strong mix of SUVs, MPVs and luxury vehicles. And just a couple of data points there. We achieved record overall market share of 14.9%, including more than 50% of the MPV segment. And for SUVs, our sales rose 144%, which was led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. 
And at GM Financial, we continue to make strides toward full captive capability. In 2015, 1 in every 3 of GM's retail sales was financed by GMF, and this was up from 1 in 10 just a year ago. 
We are well on our way of achieving the $5.5 billion in cost efficiency also that we talked about, and we plan to do this by 2018. And we expect that these savings will more than offset the additional investments we're making in our brands and in the technology that we need to not only be compliant, but to lead in the industry. 
In 2015, we had more than $2 billion in savings in nonraw material and logistics, ahead of the commitment and twice of what we achieved in 2014. As we move into 2016, we expect another year of positive performance from material and logistics standpoint. And I also want to add, we're doing it the right way with working and strengthening the relationship with many of our key suppliers. We'll also continue to leverage and drive efficiencies through using our operational excellence, which is built on Six Sigma, our Global Business Services and the IT transformation. Because of our 2015 performance and our expectations that we will sustain strong margins in the U.S. and China and break even in Europe this year, we already announced just last month that we had increased our projected 2016 earnings per share adjusted to between $5.25 and $5.75.
Before I close the -- my initial comments, I also want to comment that we know there's been a lot written about the U.S. industry being at peak levels and that a downturn is imminent. We, like many others, do not share this view. Chuck is going to go into a little bit more detail on this, but we believe the industry fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry. Having said that, we understand that we are in a cyclical business, and it's very difficult for anyone to predict the timing of a downturn. And while we feel we are very well positioned to take advantage of the strong market with important new product launches, we also have an intense focus on both cost and capital efficiencies to ensure that we will maximize earnings and cash flow through the cycle and are best prepared for whenever a downturn does occur. 
So in summary, we delivered our 2015 commitments despite a number of unforeseen headwinds, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 targets across key financial metrics. And we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth that will continue to drive shareholder value. We know we're in the midst of an industry that is being disruptive, and we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and our global resources to lead that disruption. We'll continue to strengthen our core business, and we'll also continue to invest in game changers that are necessary for GM to lead the future of personal mobility. This team is committed to delivering results. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and 2015, and that is exactly what we plan to do in 2016 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,321713294,959695,"General Motors Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of",1366,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's full year results. Without a doubt, the very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter kept an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of key financial metrics, such as net income, consolidated EBIT-adjusted, consolidated EBIT-adjusted margin, North American EBIT-adjusted and North American EBIT-adjusted margins established records not only for the fourth quarter, but also for the full year. 
From an operating perspective, EBIT-adjusted results for the year grew to a record $10.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus 2014, adjusting 2014 for the impact of recalls. The EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.1% is up 110 basis points year-over-year on the same basis. And our adjusted earnings per share for 2015 was up 65% to $5.02, another record compared with 2014, or up 22% year-over-year after adjusting 2014 for recalls. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvements during the year. Clearly, this team is committed to delivering on improving the company's profitability going forward. 
The strong earnings growth enabled significant capital returns to our owners as well, $5.7 billion in total between dividends and share repurchases in 2015.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter and, ultimately, the year was adversely impacted by cash settlements for various litigation settlements, increased capital spending and UAW ratification bonuses. With that said, we are still very much on track for a significant increase in free cash flow in 2016. And I'll talk more about 2016 in just a couple of minutes.
Although we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2015, we continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business to ensure the positive momentum continues. As Mary mentioned, we expect to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. We expect these savings will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building and technology-related costs. All of these cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, a corporate initiative which will drive common tools, common processes but, most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization. The GM team is very focused on carrying our positive momentum forward across the business.
Okay, moving on, just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. The company sustained strong operating results in 2015, which is consistent with the guidance we provided to you as we progressed through the year. Despite an industry that moderated during much of the year, we generated strong full year performance, $2.1 billion in equity income and 9.5% net margins. We were able to generate these results specifically because we had been proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as optimizing mix by increasing production of our SUVs in demand, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost down-efficiency up initiatives and working proactively with our dealers to manage inventory levels. Although we're encouraged that China's cut in the purchase tax has provided a tailwind to the industry, our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of our business. For the year, we expect the industry in China to grow in the mid-single-digit range, which will support our efforts to sustain our strong operating performance. 
With regard to North America, clearly, the region posted some impressive numbers for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $2.8 billion and 10%, respectively, again both Q4 records. For the year, we achieved EBIT-adjusted of $11 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.3%, both establishing full year records for the region. Obviously, achieving the 10% margin was a great accomplishment, especially 1 year ahead of our long-standing 2016 commitment.
The strong performance in North America for GM as well as the industry in general has sparked a debate whether the U.S. industry is peaking or plateauing. The bears argue the industry in the U.S. has peaked, and is ready to roll over. They often cite the fact that the U.S. auto industry is in its seventh year of expansion, margins are as good as they get and a recession is right around the corner, really more akin to a scenario that we saw in 2007. 
On the other hand, a number of people, including GM, believe the industry is plateauing, with many years of strong performance ahead, similar to the 2000 to 2007 time frame after the industry peaked in 2000. We believe industry fundamentals, such as the age of the vehicle fleet, firm used car pricing, credit availability and low fuel prices remain supportive. And overall car manufacturers are in much better health, lower inventory levels, lower breakeven points, strong capacity utilization. In addition, household balance sheets are strong. The labor market continues to improve. And forecasts are calling for the U.S. economy to continue its expansion, albeit at a slow and steady pace. Combining strong industry fundamentals with the positive economic backdrop gives us confidence the industry can sustain a strong SAAR in the mid-17 million unit range for a number of years. 
With that said, we are also very aware that downturns are difficult to predict. That is why we are planning and running the business accordingly, in essence, proactively managing the cycle. So what have we done? Over the past number of years, we have maintained our intense focus on cost efficiency and capital deployment. We have generated significant efficiencies over the past number of years with even more expected in 2016. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we are well on our way to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018, more than offsetting cost headwinds. We've made tough decisions on capital deployment, which improves our downside protection. These decisions included exiting markets where we have no path to viable returns. Our breakeven point in the U.S. has been maintained at an industry level of between 10 million and 11 million units, as we've kept our fixed costs flat over the past number of years. And we've refrained from chasing volume and share as we focus on profitable retail growth. 
U.S. dealer inventories have been proactively managed down. As Mary indicated, they're down over 100,000 units or 14% compared with year-end 2014. In addition and probably an area not mentioned enough, we have a much more flexible workforce, enabling us to react to market dynamics and take cost out more aggressively compared with past cycles. 
And finally, although keeping cost out of the system and looking for efficiencies are big drivers to protecting profitability in downturns, we are also executing several growth opportunities, such as GM Financial, after sales, OnStar and global Cadillac, that are somewhat independent of the vehicle cycle, fundamentally to improve our quality of earnings peak to trough. We believe execution of our proactive downturn planning will enable sustained performance through the cycle.
Moving on to our outlook for 2016. Big picture, we expect to deliver profit growth, margin expansion and an increased free cash flow. This will translate into EPS-adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 per share and free cash generation of about $6 billion, all consistent with the guidance we provided in mid-January. We'd also expect a similar cadence of earnings as we've seen in the past several years. Q1 will be seasonably weaker, Q2 and Q3 stronger and Q4 about average. 
With that said, important to point out that our Q1 results in North America will be impacted by approximately $250 million in restructuring costs. The restructuring is related to the negotiated attrition program with the UAW, which will lead to cost efficiencies going forward. And cash flow should also follow its normal seasonality pattern, with Q1 expected to be generally in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
To sum it up, we had a great quarter, a great 2015, and we expect to achieve even better results in 2016 based on our current view of the macro environment. 
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you."

And I think the key there is really, as you said, to maintain very strong discipline around inventory, aligning supply and demand. I would say the other thing that's important to note, in 2015, North America 10.3% margins with the oldest passenger car and crossover lineup in the industry. And over the next 2 years, we will cycle through all of those products, including the Malibu that we're in the midst of launching; the Cruze; the compact crossovers, the Equinox, Terrain; and the mid-crossovers. As we've said before, our expectations are the profitability of those vehicles will be significantly better than the vehicles that they replace, and it's not all price. A significant portion of that is cost efficiency and part of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies that we're driving. So I think that, yes, it's a more difficult dynamic for passenger cars. But with our launch cadence, we think that, that is still going to be a tailwind for earnings in '16 and '17."

And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities. And the partnership we have with Lyft is very important from a short term, as I mentioned, of being able to provide the short-term use vehicles for Lyft drivers. One of the biggest issues they have is drivers -- in getting drivers, it's drivers that have the appropriate vehicles to participate as a Lyft driver. So that's a clear opportunity that I think will allow us both to grow. But when we got started talking to Lyft, we believe that together, we first share a common view of how autonomous will be enabled. And we think it will start in a ridesharing type of application because you can ring fence it in and really control the environment that you're doing that. So -- and we believe that what Lyft brings to the party with really understanding the demand cycle from a sharing perspective and what we can bring from a technical perspective that we can do that quickly and also do it to our standards of the highest levels of safety as we implement this new technology into the marketplace, but do it in a controlled fashion. So we do think that we have an opportunity there. Clearly, the Bolt plays into it because there's a lot of interest in using electric vehicles to do that. So we think we have strength there. As it relates to Maven, as we've talked about in the past, we've had several pilots of Drive New York City, which we actually saw very strong acceptance due to the fact that we're going to be expanding that, and as we've mentioned also, launching into a city. And so we see these as additional opportunities that not only are -- again, we're piloting in North America, but something that will have global appeal, also have a car-sharing activity going on with CarUnity in Europe and then what we announced in China as well. So when you take all this collective learning, what it -- and the sharing space, it's allowing us to really create a platform that is going to allow us to have a relationship with the customer however they want to, rideshare, car-share or still very much supportive of the owner-driver model. So we do think the aggressive pace that we're working on, both with Lyft and with our Maven activities, is going to allow us to lead."

You were implying share buybacks of $3.5 billion. We will buy back whatever we can as quickly as we can based on the cash generation of the business. I would say, when we looked at our guidance of $5.25 to $5.75, a significant portion of that was being driven by operating performance on a year-over-year basis, and that's what we're focused on driving. When we gave our guidance, we said improved overall EBIT, improved overall EBIT margins, which implies, in my view, a significant improvement year-over-year. Relative to regions, I would just say the following. Again, in the context of company, guidance on improved profitability, improved margins and improved EPS that we would expect to see sustained strong performance in North America. Clearly, that's going to be a component -- a key component of that improvement, and continuing strong performance, sustained strong performance in China and our long-standing commitment of breakeven in Europe."

Clearly, at any point in time, on any given product or any given trend level, there could be some constraints, but it is not inhibiting sales.

We are not -- certainly not foreseeing it, but very rarely do people predict these things accurately. And just to size up what that means from a financial perspective, you know what happens in a downturn. First thing is inventory is drawn down at a dealer and then the factory unit sales kind of catch up with the SAAR levels. By really focusing on efficiency in inventory and taking these 800 -- or 100,000 units out and maintaining that discipline, that's worth about $1 billion of downside protection from an earnings and cash flow perspective versus where we were at the end of 2014.

We just launched a significantly refreshed truck at the tail end of 2015. And supply and demand and especially our supply position remains very, very strong.

And I think that's a little bit different than the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia. We are in the midst of executing a number of restructurings. As you know, Australia manufacturing take -- reducing our manufacturing presence in Thailand and Indonesia. But as I've said in the past, one of the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia is the product portfolio, the brand health and the dealer network need to also improve. So that was going to be a longer tail to address all of those issues. So clearly, we're going to invest only where we can make a viable return over time.

But with that said, January sales, the industry was up 10% year-over-year, and we were up 12% year-over-year based on preliminary numbers. So it appears that we're starting the year off reasonably well given the slower growth in China. We grew share in China in 2015 because we launched a number of great products, especially in segments that we had been underrepresented, and that includes crossovers and SUVs both at SGM and SGMW. The Baojun brand grew hundreds of percentage points of sales on a year-over-year basis. And if memory serves, we sold just under 500,000 in 2015 versus something less than 200,000 in 2014. And we have 13 products that we're launching across China in 2016, including Cadillac, locally produced XT5s and other crossovers.

We have very strong portfolio and a very strong franchise when you think about both compact, small and, importantly, medium crossovers. And we're going through an entire launch cadence on that. That has been factored into our thinking. It's factored into our thinking when we deploy capital. It's factored into our tooling rates in the plants and everything else. And we have taken a number of actions, when you think about the current strength of crossovers, to get incremental production. For instance, with the Equinox and Terrain for the last 2 or 3 years, we've built -- we started a flex activity in Spring Hill, in Oshawa to support our production in CAMI. So we're constantly looking at the optimization of our production footprint vis-à-vis where the market is going over a long period of time. But I think you're right, that ultimately there will be a permanent shift just because crossovers and SUVs are exactly what the name implies, much more utility than the traditional passenger cars."

I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered a very strong performance in this quarter. So let's take a look at the numbers. 
The highlights in year-over-year improvements include: First, revenue of $37.3 billion, up $1.6 billion. Q1 record EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion, which is up $0.6 billion. Q1 record EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1%, up 1.3 percentage points. And Q1 record earnings per share adjusted of $1.26, up 47%. Our net income was $2 billion, this is also up $1 billion. And in addition, our record 28.5 ROIC on a trailing 4-quarter basis demonstrates the positive results of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
If we look, we returned $0.9 billion to shareholders as of March 31, and in this really underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time. 
I think it's also important to take note that in Q1, we saw improved performance in all of our segments, led by North America, continued strength in China and breakeven results in Europe. 
We had positive developments for Chevrolet and Cadillac, which are our 2 global brands. To start with, in the United States, Chevrolet retail share was up a full point year-over-year to about 11%. 
Malibu's best Q1 retail sales since 1980 in the U.S. and in March, 85% of Malibu sales were the all-new model. 
In addition, we are launching the Cruze and very excited about that reception in the marketplace. 
In China, the Malibu Accel flagship sedan is also key to growing the brand in China from a Chevrolet perspective. And again, this vehicle is getting good reception. 
And from a Cadillac perspective, in the first quarter, our ATPs were the highest in North America in our history, and we are very excited about the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5 that are now launching in both China and the United States. 
From a North America perspective, U.S. retail sales are up 7% year-over-year, largely on Chevrolet and Buick performances. U.S. retail market share grew faster than any other automaker, up 1.1 percentage points to 16.6%. And our ATPs of $34,600 exceeded the industry average by about $3,500. And ending total dealer inventory was down 13% year-over-year.
If we move to China with our joint venture partners, we delivered over 963,000 vehicles, up slightly from Q1 2015, thanks to the growth in SUV and the luxury segment. The Buick Envision sales more than doubled, and when we include the Baojun 560, total SUV sales jumped 148%. 
We're also very excited about the new Buick Lacrosse sedan that was introduced that can continue to build on the strength of Buick in China. And our Cadillac sales continued to rise, up 6.1% in the quarter on top of 17%, which was the full-year increase last year. 
In Europe, we  broke even in Q1, and we are on plan to break even for the calendar year, and this is really driven by Opel's product differences [ph]. 
Opel/Vauxhall sales were 309,000, up 8.4% year-over-year, outpacing the industry, and this is really on the strength of the Astra, which was named Europe's 2016 Car of the Year. Market share was up in 15 of the 21 markets, and these are -- the increases are in most of the major markets across Europe. And we still have 2 very important product launches in Europe this year, the Astra Sportsture the Mokka Up. 
In South America, operating performance improved because of our continued work and especially the focus last year on rightsizing the business while protecting the new product pipeline. 
And if we look at GM Financial, GM Financial grew its captive presence with GM customers and dealers in all regions, with North America increasing its penetration of GM retail sales to 37% in the quarter. This is up from 21% in the first quarter of 2015. 
And across the company, our operational excellence program, which is really driving Six Sigma and continuous improvement in every aspect of the business, is well underway and is playing a key role in the $5.5 billion cost efficiency challenge that we have outlined and that we expect to achieve by 2018.
The success of the core business has enabled us to make smart investments in shaping the future of personal mobility. On the autonomous front, we announced our intent to acquire Cruze automation to further accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology and position General Motors in the leadership role. 
In car sharing, we introduced Maven, which combines and expands our multiple car-sharing program under a single brand, which includes Maven City and Maven Plus. Maven City offers cars on demand in key cities, driven by OnStar-powered smartphone connectivity that really provides the customers an ownership-like experience. And Maven Plus is a completely dedicated private fleet for residential community. We started this in New York City, as I talked about in the past. We're going to soon be adding Chicago, and this will give us the potential to reach more than 5,000 residents. 
On ridesharing, as you know, we also announced the strategic partnership with Lyft, and it's a 4-dimensional approach that enables us, first, to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous cars. 
And we also introduced Express drive, and this is a short-term rental program on the Lyft platform that makes General Motors cars available to Lyft drivers at affordable rates. It also exposes both passengers and drivers to our products and gets more seats than seats. We have the first launch, which is in Chicago, and demand is 8x the supply. We plan to add hubs in Boston and Baltimore and Washington in the near future.
Another aspect of the alliance in that partnership that we have with Lyft is being able to combine the Lyft experience with our vehicle connectivity leadership, and this really provides a better experience for the customer. And we also see many opportunities to jointly expand both of our business and present cross-marketing opportunities, and you'll see us taking advantage of those as we move forward. 
From an alternative propulsion perspective, we also revealed the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronics Show. It's going to achieve more than 200 miles per charge of all EV range and will cost about $30,000 after government incentives. Production will begin later this year.
So in summary, our strong first quarter gives us even more confidence that we will deliver the earnings growth we outlined in January. We delivered Q1 record EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin and EPS adjusted, along with a record return on invested capital. Our aggressive product launch cadence and continued cost discipline will help us deliver on our commitments for the year and continue to drive shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,328901577,960627,"General Motors Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, w",931,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, we are on track for another record year in 2016, very much in line with the overview  we provided back in January. 
But just a few comments on our results by region. First, let me start with North America. North America continues to put up impressive numbers. We continue to see steady moderate industry growth in the U.S. of approximately 3%, and we expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion was a first quarter record, up over $100 million from a year ago despite over $200 million in restructuring expense and the increased launch-related costs. 
The success of our important launches, like the Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze as well as material and cost efficiencies will help more than offset higher D&A, marketing- and engineering-related costs throughout the year as we continue to invest in our portfolio and brands. And as we've said before, we expect to maintain 10-plus percent margins for the calendar year while delivering improved EBIT-adjusted performance compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe, we are very pleased with the breakeven results in Europe. More than a $200 million improvement year-over-year, and we remain very much on track to deliver breakeven results for the full year. We continue to see moderate growth in Europe, where industry volumes were up about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. And as Mary indicated earlier, Opel/Vauxhall sales outpaced the industry by growing over 8% compared to a year ago.
The success of Opel/Vauxhall's recent launches such as the Astra and the Corsa have contributed to increased whole sales and related topline growth in the region. We're also very focused on costs, where we are utilizing tools such as operational excellence throughout the region and you were seeing some of the results. 
In regards to earnings cadence for the year, we expect normal seasonality throughout the year while we continue to manage FX challenges in the region.
Moving on to China, another solid quarter with strong equity income of $518 million, about equal to a year ago. While the industry grew roughly 6% in the quarter, our retail sales were roughly flat year-over-year. The quarter was impacted by model changeovers. However, as our launches ramp up, we expect volumes and market share to improve. Our previous guidance, industry growth in the mid-single-digit range and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed, and we are very much on track.
We also continue to capitalize on improving mix with our strong SUV and MPV sales as well as products like the Cadillac CT6 and XT5 while remaining focused on cost efficiencies and driving material cost performance.
Turning to South America. EBIT-adjusted improved this quarter versus a year ago by approximately $150 million and a much more challenging economic environment. As you are aware, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging, with no near-term recovery in sight. While we're pleased with the developments in Argentina and are seeing positive market signs there, political uncertainty continues in Brazil, where industry volumes were down 29% in the first quarter. However, the results of our restructuring actions over the past year contributed to improved results this quarter versus a year ago. We'll continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and GM's results in that region as appropriate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it materializes. 
Finally, GMF. We continue to execute our captive strategy and are seeing the results. As Mary mentioned, penetration in the U.S. increased to 37% in the first quarter, up from 21% last year. Revenue grew by $700 million to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, a record. And we earned $225 million in earnings before taxes in the first quarter, another record.
Shifting to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value. In the first quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders, including $600 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. We also remain focused on investing in the business. And as Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investment in Lyft and Cruze automation will help us build the foundation for driving further shareholder value in the future. 
And as we indicated earlier this year, we also took steps to further derisk the balance sheet by contributing $1.5 billion to our U.S. hourly pension plan during the quarter and just recently finalized another $500 million contribution in April. As you know, the $2 billion contribution was funded with debt, providing the company greater flexibility by pushing out any required pension contributions further into the future.
As expected and in line with normal seasonality, Q1 adjusted automotive free cash flow was an outflow of $1.5 billion for the quarter, which was a $200 million improvement versus a year ago. 
With regard to our total company outlook for the year, we are very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company. 
And we have even more confidence that we will achieve our EPS adjusted guidance of $5.25 to $5.75 for the full year. And we continue to expect growth in adjusted automotive free cash flow to nearly $6 billion in 2016. 
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Then when you look at autonomous, and we believe that we'll see autonomous in the marketplace first in a ridesharing activity for a whole host of reasons of being able to control and grow and learn, we think that's a huge opportunity across the globe to your point.

From a carryover pricing perspective, the positive is we continue to see price opportunities on full-size trucks and full-size SUVs that we are taking advantage of.

But in addition in the first quarter, we had launch-related costs from both a marketing and a manufacturing perspective in the range of $200 million. We very clearly talked about an increase in engineering expense in 2016 versus the prior year to support our very aggressive product launch cadence. And that, obviously, has had an impact in Q1. But as we've talked about in the past, broadly speaking, starting in a company level, Rod, we said that incremental material, logistics performance, savings in manufacturing and GBS would more than offset increased fixed costs associated with D&A, marketing and engineering as we went through that product launch cadence, and that's playing out as we expected from a total company level. In North America, we cycle through, and we're talking to you early next February. I would expect that to be relatively flattish when I think about material cost performance, logistics performance and the next fixed cost increase year-over-year. So nothing fundamentally has changed. And my last comment would be, take this in the context of we will and we're still very much on track to generate 10-plus percent EBIT margins in North America in 2016.

But then we also have a lot of electrification, the Malibu hybrid and we'll be launching over 10 new electrified vehicles in China. So to us, really the electrification is something that we integrate into the portfolio that allows us to build not only our capability and spread it broadly and reach more customers but also to build those brands. So they are viewed appropriately as technology leaders. And I think we continue to do that so we see it as core and integrated."

So as we sell those daily rentals, we get less customer deposits. As we defleet, it has an impact on operating leases.

The Baojun 560, we are launching critical new products like the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5. So mix has been a mitigant to the price headwinds as well as carryover material performance. And kind of when I look at those 2 together, they kind of offset the price headwinds and where you see the benefit at least on an aggregate equity income or profit perspective is volume. And we would expect to see that play out. Obviously, we'll continue to focus very much on cost efficiency, both material logistics and fixed cost.

I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered a very strong performance in this quarter. So let's take a look at the numbers. 
The highlights in year-over-year improvements include: first, revenue of $37.3 billion, up $1.6 billion; Q1 record EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion, which is up $0.6 billion; Q1 record EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1%, up 1.3 percentage points; and Q1 record earnings per share adjusted of $1.26, up 47%. Our net income was $2 billion, this is also up $1 billion. And in addition, our record 28.5 ROIC on a trailing 4-quarter basis demonstrates the positive results of our disciplined capital allocation framework.
If we look, we returned $0.9 billion to shareholders as of March 31, and this really underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time.
I think it's also important to take note that in Q1, we saw improved performance in all of our segments, led by North America, continued strength in China and breakeven results in Europe.
We've had positive developments for Chevrolet and Cadillac, which are our 2 global brands. To start with, in the United States, Chevrolet retail share was up a full point year-over-year to about 11%.
Malibu's best Q1 retail sales since 1980 in the U.S. and in March, 85% of Malibu sales for the all-new model. In addition, we are launching the Cruze and very excited about that reception in the marketplace.
In China, the Malibu XL flagship sedan is also key to growing the brand in China from a Chevrolet perspective. And again, this vehicle is getting good reception. And from a Cadillac perspective, in the first quarter, our ATPs were the highest in North America in our history, and we're very excited about the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5 that are now launching in both China and the United States.
From a North America perspective, U.S. retail sales are up 7% year-over-year, largely on Chevrolet and Buick performances. U.S. retail market share grew faster than any other automaker, up 1.1 percentage points to 16.6%. And our ATPs of $34,600 exceeded the industry average by about $3,500. And ending total dealer inventory was down 13% year-over-year.
If we move to China with our joint venture partners, we delivered over 963,000 vehicles, up slightly from Q1 2015, thanks to the growth in SUV and the luxury segment. The Buick Envision sales more than doubled, and when we include the Baojun 560, total SUV sales jumped 148%.
We're also very excited about the new Buick LaCrosse sedan that was introduced that can continue to build on the strength of Buick in China. And our Cadillac sales continued to rise, up 6.1% in the quarter on top of 17%, which was the full-year increase last year.
In Europe, we broke even in Q1, and we are on plan to breakeven for the calendar year, and this is really driven by Opel's product offensive.
Opel/Vauxhall sales were 309,000, up 8.4% year-over-year, outpacing the industry, and this is really on the strength of the Astra, which was named Europe's 2016 Car of the Year. Market share was up in 15 of the 21 markets, and these are -- the increases are in most of the major markets across Europe. And we still have 2 very important product launches in Europe this year, the Astra Sports Tourer and the Mokka X.
In South America, operating performance improved because of our continued work and especially the focus last year on rightsizing the business while protecting the new product pipeline.
And if we look at GM Financial, GM Financial grew its captive presence with GM customers and dealers in all regions, with North America increasing its penetration of GM retail sales to 37% in the quarter. This is up from 21% in the first quarter of 2015.
And across the company, our operational excellence program, which is really driving Six Sigma and continuous improvement in every aspect of the business, is well underway and it's playing a key role in the $5.5 billion cost efficiency challenge that we have outlined and that we expect to achieve by 2018.
The success of the core business has enabled us to make smart investments in shaping the future of personal mobility. On the autonomous front, we announced our intent to acquire Cruze automation to further accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology and position General Motors in a leadership role.
In car sharing, we introduced Maven, which combines and expands our multiple car-sharing program under a single brand, which includes Maven City and Maven+. Maven City offers cars on demand in key cities, driven by OnStar-powered smartphone connectivity that really provides the customers an ownership-like experience. And Maven+ is a completely dedicated private fleet for residential communities. We started this in New York City, as I talked about in the past. We're going to soon be adding Chicago, and this will give us the potential to reach more than 5,000 residents.
On ridesharing, as you know, we also announced the strategic partnership with Lyft, and it's a 4-dimensional approach that enables us, first, to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous cars.
And we also introduced Express Drive, and this is a short-term rental program on the Lyft platform that makes General Motors cars available to Lyft drivers at affordable rates. It also exposes both passengers and drivers to our products and gets more seats than seats [ph]. We have the first launch, which is in Chicago, and demand is 8x the supply. We plan to add hubs in Boston and Baltimore and Washington in the near future.
Another aspect of the alliance in that partnership that we have with Lyft is being able to combine the Lyft experience with our vehicle connectivity leadership, and this really provides a better experience for the customer. And we also see many opportunities to jointly expand both of our business and present cross-marketing opportunities, and you'll see us taking advantage of those as we move forward.
From an alternative propulsion perspective, we also revealed the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronics Show. It's going to achieve more than 200 miles per charge of all EV range and will cost about $30,000 after government incentive. Production will begin later this year.
So in summary, our strong first quarter gives us even more confidence that we will deliver the earnings growth we outlined in January. We delivered Q1 record EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins and EPS-adjusted, along with a record return on invested capital. Our aggressive product launch cadence and continued cost discipline will help us deliver on our commitments for the year and continue to drive shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,328901577,960967,"General Motors Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary.I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly,",928,"Thanks, Mary.
I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, we're on track for another record year in 2016, very much in line with the overview we provided back in January.
But just a few comments on our results by region. First, let me start with North America. North America continues to put up impressive numbers. We continue to see steady moderate industry growth in the U.S. of approximately 3%, and we expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion was a first quarter record, up over $100 million from a year ago despite over $200 million in restructuring expense and the increased launch-related costs.
The success of our important launches, like the Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze as well as material and cost efficiencies, will help more than offset higher D&A, marketing- and engineering-related costs throughout the year as we continue to invest in our portfolio and brands. And as we've said before, we expect to maintain 10-plus percent margins for the calendar year while delivering improved EBIT-adjusted performance compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. We are very pleased with the breakeven results in Europe. More than a $200 million improvement year-over-year, and we remain very much on track to deliver breakeven results for the full year. We continue to see moderate growth in Europe, where industry volumes were up about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. And as Mary indicated earlier, Opel/Vauxhall sales outpaced the industry by growing over 8% compared to a year ago.
The success of Opel/Vauxhall's recent launches such as the Astra and the Corsa have contributed to increased whole sales and related topline growth in the region. We're also very focused on cost, where we are utilizing tools such as operational excellence throughout the region, and you are seeing some of the results.
In regards to earnings cadence for the year, we expect normal seasonality throughout the year while we continue to manage FX challenges in the region.
Moving on to China. Another solid quarter with strong equity income of $518 million, about equal to a year ago. While the industry grew roughly 6% in the quarter, our retail sales were roughly flat year-over-year. The quarter was impacted by model changeovers. However, as our launches ramp up, we expect volumes and market share to improve. Our previous guidance, industry growth in the mid-single-digit range and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed, and we are very much on track.
We also continue to capitalize on improving mix with our strong SUV and MPV sales as well as products like the Cadillac CT6 and XT5 while remaining focused on cost efficiencies and driving material cost performance.
Turning to South America. EBIT-adjusted improved this quarter versus a year ago by approximately $150 million and a much more challenging economic environment. As you're aware, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging, with no near-term recovery in sight. While we're pleased with the developments in Argentina and are seeing positive market signs there, political uncertainty continues in Brazil, where industry volumes were down 29% in the first quarter. However, the results of our restructuring actions over the past year contributed to improved results this quarter versus a year ago. We'll continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and GM's results in that region as appropriate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it materializes.
Finally, GMF. We continue to execute our captive strategy and are seeing the results. As Mary mentioned, penetration in the U.S. increased to 37% in the first quarter, up from 21% last year. Revenue grew by $700 million to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, a record. And we earned $225 million in earnings before taxes in the first quarter, another record.
Shifting to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value. In the first quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders, including $600 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. We also remain focused on investing in the business. And as Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation will help us build the foundation for driving further shareholder value in the future.
And as we indicated earlier this year, we also took steps to further de-risk the balance sheet by contributing $1.5 billion to our U.S. hourly pension plan during the quarter and just recently finalized another $500 million contribution in April. As you know, the $2 billion contribution was funded with debt, providing the company greater flexibility by pushing out any required pension contributions further into the future.
As expected and in line with normal seasonality, Q1 adjusted automotive free cash flow was an outflow of $1.5 billion for the quarter, which was a $200 million improvement versus a year ago.
With regard to our total company outlook for the year, we are very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company.
And we have even more confidence that we will achieve our EPS-adjusted guidance of $5.25 to $5.75 for the full year. And we continue to expect growth in adjusted automotive free cash flow to nearly $6 billion in 2016.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This year we had the SAP program, which we've talked about very clearly, which was in the range of $240 million. You already brought up the pension. But in addition in the first quarter, we had launch-related costs from both a marketing and a manufacturing perspective in the range of $200 million. We very clearly talked about an increase in engineering expense in 2016 versus the prior year to support our very aggressive product launch cadence. And that, obviously, has had an impact in Q1. But as we've talked about in the past, broadly speaking, starting in a company level, Rod, we said that incremental material, logistics performance, savings in manufacturing and GBS would more than offset increased fixed costs associated with D&A, marketing and engineering as we went through that product launch cadence, and that's playing out as we expected from a total company level. In North America, we cycle through, and we're talking to you early next February. I would expect that to be relatively flattish when I think about material cost performance, logistics performance and the next fixed cost increase year-over-year. So nothing fundamentally has changed. And my last comment would be, take this in the context of we will and we're still very much on track to generate 10-plus percent EBIT margins in North America in 2016. And obviously, there'll be puts and takes on all the drivers, but I think that's the fundamental message."

Well, certainly, as we go through the launch cadence, not only on passenger cars and new entries in the Cadillac portfolio and refreshing the oldest crossover lineup, we would expect to see that profit dynamic shift and obviously, improve those profit pools in passenger cars and crossovers vis-à-vis trucks. The other thing that's just mathematically impacting that shift from the 2014 cadence, the 2015 cadence, we're selling more vehicles in Mexico. And obviously, there are more passenger cars there, and they are lower priced, lower profit, obviously, lower cost, and that's having an impact as well. Relative to trucks, the way you protect your profit pool in trucks and SUVs, great products, great brands continue to take advantage of that, align supply and demand and continue to drive cost efficiency. And our trucks, well into their life cycle, continue to perform very well. We had just under 38% retail share in the first quarter. We continue to lead in the industry. We just launched a refreshed truck, which will carry us to the next-generation truck. And we feel very confident that we'll be able to protect those pools because we've got great products."

I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered a very strong performance in this quarter. So let's take a look at the numbers. 
The highlights in year-over-year improvements include: first, revenue of $37.3 billion, up $1.6 billion; Q1 record EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion, which is up $0.6 billion; Q1 record EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1%, up 1.3 percentage points; and Q1 record earnings per share adjusted of $1.26, up 47%. Our net income was $2 billion, this is also up $1 billion. And in addition, our record 28.5 ROIC on a trailing 4-quarter basis demonstrates the positive results of our disciplined capital allocation framework.
If we look, we returned $0.9 billion to shareholders as of March 31, and this really underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time.
I think it's also important to take note that in Q1, we saw improved performance in all of our segments, led by North America, continued strength in China and breakeven results in Europe.
We've had positive developments for Chevrolet and Cadillac, which are our 2 global brands. To start with, in the United States, Chevrolet retail share was up a full point year-over-year to about 11%.
Malibu's best Q1 retail sales since 1980 in the U.S. and in March, 85% of Malibu sales were the all-new model. In addition, we are launching the Cruze and very excited about that reception in the marketplace.
In China, the Malibu XL flagship sedan is also key to growing the brand in China from a Chevrolet perspective. And again, this vehicle is getting good reception. And from a Cadillac perspective, in first quarter, our ATPs were the highest in North America in our history, and we're very excited about the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5 that are now launching in both China and the United States.
From a North America perspective, U.S. retail sales are up 7% year-over-year, largely on Chevrolet and Buick performances. U.S. retail market share grew faster than any other automaker, up 1.1 percentage points to 16.6%. And our ATPs of $34,600 exceeded the industry average by about $3,500. And ending total dealer inventory was down 13% year-over-year.
If we move to China with our joint venture partners, we delivered over 963,000 vehicles, up slightly from Q1 2015, thanks to the growth in SUV and the luxury segment. The Buick Envision sales more than doubled, and when we include the Baojun 560, total SUV sales jumped 148%.
We're also very excited about the new Buick LaCrosse sedan that was introduced that can continue to build on the strength of Buick in China. And our Cadillac sales continue to rise, up 6.1% in the quarter on top of 17%, which was the full-year increase last year.
In Europe, we broke even in Q1, and we are on plan to breakeven for the calendar year, and this is really driven by Opel's product offensive.
Opel/Vauxhall sales were 309,000, up 8.4% year-over-year, outpacing the industry, and this is really on the strength of the Astra, which was named Europe's 2016 Car of the Year. Market share was up in 15 of the 21 markets, and these are -- the increases are in most of the major markets across Europe. And we still have 2 very important product launches in Europe this year, the Astra Sports Tourer and the Mokka X.
In South America, operating performance improved because of our continued work and, especially, the focus last year on rightsizing the business while protecting the new product pipeline.
And if we look at GM Financial, GM Financial grew its captive presence with GM customers and dealers in all regions, with North America increasing its penetration of GM retail sales to 37% in the quarter. This is up from 21% in the first quarter of 2015.
And across the company, our operational excellence program, which is really driving Six Sigma and continuous improvement in every aspect of the business, is well underway and it's playing a key role in the $5.5 billion cost efficiency challenge that we have outlined and that we expect to achieve by 2018.
The success of the core business has enabled us to make smart investments in shaping the future of personal mobility. On the autonomous front, we announced our intent to acquire Cruise Automation to further accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology and position General Motors in a leadership role.
In car sharing, we introduced Maven, which combines and expands our multiple car-sharing program under a single brand, which includes Maven City and Maven+. Maven City offers cars on demand in key cities, driven by OnStar-powered smartphone connectivity that really provides the customers an ownership-like experience. And Maven+ is a completely dedicated private fleet for residential communities. We started this in New York City, as I talked about in the past. We're going to soon be adding Chicago, and this will give us the potential to reach more than 5,000 residents.
On ridesharing, as you know, we also announced a strategic partnership with Lyft, and it's a 4-dimensional approach that enables us, first, to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous cars.
And we also introduced Express Drive, and this is a short-term rental program on the Lyft platform that makes General Motors cars available to Lyft drivers at affordable rates. It also exposes both passengers and drivers to our products and gets more seats in seats. We have the first launch, which is in Chicago, and demand is 8x the supply. We plan to add hubs in Boston and Baltimore and Washington in the near future.
Another aspect of the alliance in the partnership that we have with Lyft is being able to combine the Lyft experience with our vehicle connectivity leadership, and this really provides a better experience for the customer. And we also see many opportunities to jointly expand both of our business and present cross-marketing opportunities, and you'll see us taking advantage of those as we move forward.
From an alternative propulsion perspective, we also revealed the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronics Show. It's going to achieve more than 200 miles per charge of all EV range and will cost about $30,000 after government incentive. Production will begin later this year.
So in summary, our strong first quarter gives us even more confidence that we will deliver the earnings growth we outlined in January. We delivered Q1 record EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins and EPS-adjusted, along with a record return on invested capital. Our aggressive product launch cadence and continued cost discipline will help us deliver on our commitments for the year and continue to drive shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,328901577,961239,"General Motors Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary.I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly,",926,"Thanks, Mary.
I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, we're on track for another record year in 2016, very much in line with the overview we provided back in January.
But just a few comments on our results by region. First, let me start with North America. North America continues to put up impressive numbers. We continue to see steady moderate industry growth in the U.S. of approximately 3%, and we expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion was a first quarter record, up over $100 million from a year ago despite over $200 million in restructuring expense and increased launch-related costs.
The success of our important launches like the Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze as well as material and cost efficiencies will help more than offset higher D&A, marketing- and engineering-related costs throughout the year as we continue to invest in our portfolio and brands. And as we've said before, we expect to maintain 10-plus percent margins for the calendar year while delivering improved EBIT-adjusted performance compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. We are very pleased with the breakeven results in Europe. More than a $200 million improvement year-over-year, and we remain very much on track to deliver breakeven results for the full year. We continue to see moderate growth in Europe, where industry volumes were up about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. And as Mary indicated earlier, Opel/Vauxhall sales outpaced the industry by growing over 8% compared to a year ago.
The success of Opel/Vauxhall's recent launches such as the Astra and the Corsa have contributed to increased wholesales and related topline growth in the region. We're also very focused on cost, where we are utilizing tools such as operational excellence throughout the region, and you are seeing some of the results.
In regards to earnings cadence for the year, we expect normal seasonality throughout the year while we continue to manage FX challenges in the region.
Moving on to China. Another solid quarter with strong equity income of $518 million, about equal to a year ago. While the industry grew roughly 6% in the quarter, our retail sales were roughly flat year-over-year. The quarter was impacted by model changeovers. However, as our launches ramp up, we expect volumes and market share to improve. Our previous guidance, industry growth in the mid-single-digit range and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed, and we are very much on track.
We also continue to capitalize on improving mix with our strong SUV and MPV sales as well as products like the Cadillac CT6 and XT5 while remaining focused on cost efficiencies and driving material cost performance.
Turning to South America. EBIT-adjusted improved this quarter versus a year ago by approximately $150 million in a much more challenging economic environment. As you're aware, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging with no near-term recovery in sight. While we're pleased with the developments in Argentina and are seeing positive market signs there, political uncertainty continues in Brazil, where industry volumes were down 29% in the first quarter. However, the result of our restructuring actions over the past year contributed to improved results this quarter versus a year ago. We'll continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and GM's results in that region as appropriate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it materializes.
Finally, GMF. We continue to execute our captive strategy and are seeing the results. As Mary mentioned, penetration in the U.S. increased to 37% in the first quarter, up from 21% last year. Revenue grew by $700 million to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, a record. And we earned $225 million in earnings before taxes in the first quarter, another record.
Shifting to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value. In the first quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders, including $600 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. We also remain focused on investing in the business. And as Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation will help us build the foundation for driving further shareholder value in the future.
And as we indicated earlier this year, we also took steps to further de-risk the balance sheet by contributing $1.5 billion to our U.S. hourly pension plan during the quarter and just recently finalized another $500 million contribution in April. As you know, the $2 billion contribution was funded with debt, providing the company greater flexibility by pushing out any required pension contributions further into the future.
As expected and in line with normal seasonality, Q1 adjusted automotive free cash flow was an outflow of $1.5 billion for the quarter, which was a $200 million improvement versus a year ago.
With regard to our total company outlook for the year, we are very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company.
And we have even more confidence that we will achieve our EPS-adjusted guidance of $5.25 to $5.75 for the full year. And we continue to expect growth in adjusted automotive free cash flow to nearly $6 billion in 2016.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

I'm just curious if that is correct and if that's something you think will continue through the course of this year. And what is that, what is driving that? Is that just better market conditions? Or is that better residual performance because nameplates and brands are starting to resonate with consumers?"

And that is related to fewer units being placed into service. When you look at the impact of daily rental on cash flow, you need to look at both the equipment on operating leases and accrued and other liabilities and inventory. So it kind of shows up in 3 different places. We can provide you with a little bit more specificity around that, but that has nothing to do with lease residuals on vehicles that are being leased through GMF. Obviously, that flows through GMF results. But with that said, we are seeing -- continue to see positive results on lease terminations from a GMF perspective."

When you look at the electrification, not only just all electric with the Bolt, but extended-range electric vehicle with the Volt and even vehicles like the Malibu Hybrid. So I think we look at it and see it as an opportunity. To a certain extent Volt and now Bolt EV are starting to have a level all their own, and we think it really compliments the Chevrolet brand globally."

When you look at the technology that we're putting into cars as it relates to connectivity.

Then when you look at autonomous, and we believe that we'll see autonomous in the marketplace first in a ridesharing activity for a whole host of reasons of being able to control and grow and learn. We think that's a huge opportunity across the globe to your point. So I can't specifically size it, but I think it's extremely significant. That's why we're pushing it so aggressively, and it builds on top of a strong core business. So again, I think that will unfold over time, but we see it as significant."

But in addition in the first quarter, we had launch-related costs from both a marketing and a manufacturing perspective in the range of $200 million. We very clearly talked about an increase in engineering expense in 2016 versus the prior year to support our very aggressive product launch cadence. And that, obviously, has had an impact in Q1. But as we've talked about in the past, broadly speaking, starting at a company level Rod, we said that incremental material, logistics performance, savings in manufacturing and GBS would more than offset increased fixed costs associated with D&A, marketing and engineering as we went through that product launch cadence. And that's playing out as we expected from a total company level. In North America, we cycle through and we're talking to you early next February, I would expect that to be relatively flattish when I think about material cost performance, logistics performance and the net fixed cost increase year-over-year. So nothing fundamentally has changed.

And obviously, there are more passenger cars there, and they are lower priced, lower profit, obviously, lower cost, and that's having an impact as well. Relative to trucks, the way you protect your profit pool in trucks and SUVs: great products, great brands, continue to take advantage of that, align supply and demand and continue to drive cost efficiency. And our trucks, well into their life cycle, continue to perform very well. We had just under 38% retail share in the first quarter. We continue to lead in the industry.

From the credit side you talked earlier, it sounds like you don't see a big impact from used car prices on your lease portfolio.

And we're offsetting that impact through improved -- significantly improved mix and you saw some of those results: the Envision, as an SUV, sales up significantly; the Baojun 560; we're launching critical new products like the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5. So mix has been a mitigant to the price headwinds as well as carryover material performance. And kind of when I look at those 2 together, they kind of offset the price headwinds and where you see the benefit at least on an aggregate equity income or profit perspective is volume. And we would expect to see that play out. Obviously, we continue to focus very much on cost efficiency, both material logistics and fixed cost. But broadly speaking, favorable volume, favorable mix as we improve our Cadillac portfolio and launch more crossovers and MPVs, favorable material performance offsetting or more than offsetting price headwinds as well as fixed cost increase as we bring up new plants.

I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered a very strong performance in this quarter. So let's take a look at the numbers. 
The highlights in year-over-year improvements include: first, revenue of $37.3 billion, up $1.6 billion; Q1 record EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion, which is up $0.6 billion; Q1 record EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1%, up 1.3 percentage points; and Q1 record earnings per share adjusted of $1.26, up 47%. Our net income was $2 billion, this is also up $1 billion. And in addition, our record 28.5 ROIC on a trailing 4-quarter basis demonstrates the positive results of our disciplined capital allocation framework.
If we look, we returned $0.9 billion to shareholders as of March 31, and this really underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time.
I think it's also important to take note that in Q1, we saw improved performance in all of our segments, led by North America, continued strength in China and breakeven results in Europe.
We've had positive developments for Chevrolet and Cadillac, which are our 2 global brands. To start with, in the United States, Chevrolet retail share was up a full point year-over-year to about 11%.
Malibu's best Q1 retail sales since 1980 in the U.S. and in March, 85% of Malibu sales were the all-new model. In addition, we are launching the Cruze and very excited about that reception in the marketplace.
In China, the Malibu XL flagship sedan is also key to growing the brand in China from a Chevrolet perspective. And again, this vehicle is getting good reception. And from a Cadillac perspective, in first quarter, our ATPs were the highest in North America in our history, and we're very excited about the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5 that are now launching in both China and the United States.
From a North America perspective, U.S. retail sales are up 7% year-over-year, largely on Chevrolet and Buick performances. U.S. retail market share grew faster than any other automaker, up 1.1 percentage points to 16.6%. And our ATPs of $34,600 exceeded the industry average by about $3,500. And ending total dealer inventory was down 13% year-over-year.
If we move to China with our joint venture partners, we delivered over 963,000 vehicles, up slightly from Q1 2015, thanks to the growth in SUV and the luxury segment. The Buick Envision sales more than doubled, and when we include the Baojun 560, total SUV sales jumped 148%.
We're also very excited about the new Buick LaCrosse sedan that was introduced that can continue to build on the strength of Buick in China. And our Cadillac sales continue to rise, up 6.1% in the quarter on top of 17%, which was the full-year increase last year.
In Europe, we broke even in Q1, and we are on plan to breakeven for the calendar year, and this is really driven by Opel's product offensive.
Opel/Vauxhall sales were 309,000, up 8.4% year-over-year, outpacing the industry, and this is really on the strength of the Astra, which was named Europe's 2016 Car of the Year. Market share was up in 15 of the 21 markets, and these are -- the increases are in most of the major markets across Europe. And we still have 2 very important product launches in Europe this year, the Astra Sports Tourer and the Mokka X.
In South America, operating performance improved because of our continued work and, especially, the focus last year on rightsizing the business while protecting the new product pipeline.
And if we look at GM Financial, GM Financial grew its captive presence with GM customers and dealers in all regions, with North America increasing its penetration of GM retail sales to 37% in the quarter. This is up from 21% in the first quarter of 2015.
And across the company, our operational excellence program, which is really driving Six Sigma and continuous improvement in every aspect of the business, is well underway and it's playing a key role in the $5.5 billion cost efficiency challenge that we have outlined and that we expect to achieve by 2018.
The success of the core business has enabled us to make smart investments in shaping the future of personal mobility. On the autonomous front, we announced our intent to acquire Cruise Automation to further accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology and position General Motors in a leadership role.
In car sharing, we introduced Maven, which combines and expands our multiple car-sharing program under a single brand, which includes Maven City and Maven+. Maven City offers cars on demand in key cities, driven by OnStar-powered smartphone connectivity that really provides the customers an ownership-like experience. And Maven+ is a completely dedicated private fleet for residential communities. We started this in New York City, as I talked about in the past. We're going to soon be adding Chicago, and this will give us the potential to reach more than 5,000 residents.
On ridesharing, as you know, we also announced a strategic partnership with Lyft, and it's a 4-dimensional approach that enables us, first, to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous cars.
And we also introduced Express Drive, and this is a short-term rental program on the Lyft platform that makes General Motors cars available to Lyft drivers at affordable rates. It also exposes both passengers and drivers to our products and gets more seats in seats. We have the first launch, which is in Chicago, and demand is 8x the supply. We plan to add hubs in Boston and Baltimore and Washington in the near future.
Another aspect of the alliance in the partnership that we have with Lyft is being able to combine the Lyft experience with our vehicle connectivity leadership, and this really provides a better experience for the customer. And we also see many opportunities to jointly expand both of our business and present cross-marketing opportunities, and you'll see us taking advantage of those as we move forward.
From an alternative propulsion perspective, we also revealed the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronics Show. It's going to achieve more than 200 miles per charge of all EV range and will cost about $30,000 after government incentive. Production will begin later this year.
So in summary, our strong first quarter gives us even more confidence that we will deliver the earnings growth we outlined in January. We delivered Q1 record EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins and EPS-adjusted, along with a record return on invested capital. Our aggressive product launch cadence and continued cost discipline will help us deliver on our commitments for the year and continue to drive shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,328901577,961936,"General Motors Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary.I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly,",926,"Thanks, Mary.
I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, we're on track for another record year in 2016, very much in line with the overview we provided back in January.
But just a few comments on our results by region. First, let me start with North America. North America continues to put up impressive numbers. We continue to see steady moderate industry growth in the U.S. of approximately 3%, and we expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion was a first quarter record, up over $100 million from a year ago despite over $200 million in restructuring expense and increased launch-related costs.
The success of our important launches like the Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze as well as material and cost efficiencies will help more than offset higher D&A, marketing- and engineering-related costs throughout the year as we continue to invest in our portfolio and brands. And as we've said before, we expect to maintain 10-plus percent margins for the calendar year while delivering improved EBIT-adjusted performance compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. We are very pleased with the breakeven results in Europe. More than a $200 million improvement year-over-year, and we remain very much on track to deliver breakeven results for the full year. We continue to see moderate growth in Europe, where industry volumes were up about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. And as Mary indicated earlier, Opel/Vauxhall sales outpaced the industry by growing over 8% compared to a year ago.
The success of Opel/Vauxhall's recent launches such as the Astra and the Corsa have contributed to increased wholesales and related topline growth in the region. We're also very focused on cost, where we are utilizing tools such as operational excellence throughout the region, and you are seeing some of the results.
In regards to earnings cadence for the year, we expect normal seasonality throughout the year while we continue to manage FX challenges in the region.
Moving on to China. Another solid quarter with strong equity income of $518 million, about equal to a year ago. While the industry grew roughly 6% in the quarter, our retail sales were roughly flat year-over-year. The quarter was impacted by model changeovers. However, as our launches ramp up, we expect volumes and market share to improve. Our previous guidance, industry growth in the mid-single-digit range and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed, and we are very much on track.
We also continue to capitalize on improving mix with our strong SUV and MPV sales as well as products like the Cadillac CT6 and XT5 while remaining focused on cost efficiencies and driving material cost performance.
Turning to South America. EBIT-adjusted improved this quarter versus a year ago by approximately $150 million in a much more challenging economic environment. As you're aware, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging with no near-term recovery in sight. While we're pleased with the developments in Argentina and are seeing positive market signs there, political uncertainty continues in Brazil, where industry volumes were down 29% in the first quarter. However, the result of our restructuring actions over the past year contributed to improved results this quarter versus a year ago. We'll continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and GM's results in that region as appropriate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it materializes.
Finally, GMF. We continue to execute our captive strategy and are seeing the results. As Mary mentioned, penetration in the U.S. increased to 37% in the first quarter, up from 21% last year. Revenue grew by $700 million to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, a record. And we earned $225 million in earnings before taxes in the first quarter, another record.
Shifting to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value. In the first quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders, including $600 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. We also remain focused on investing in the business. And as Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation will help us build the foundation for driving further shareholder value in the future.
And as we indicated earlier this year, we also took steps to further de-risk the balance sheet by contributing $1.5 billion to our U.S. hourly pension plan during the quarter and just recently finalized another $500 million contribution in April. As you know, the $2 billion contribution was funded with debt, providing the company greater flexibility by pushing out any required pension contributions further into the future.
As expected and in line with normal seasonality, Q1 adjusted automotive free cash flow was an outflow of $1.5 billion for the quarter, which was a $200 million improvement versus a year ago.
With regard to our total company outlook for the year, we are very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company.
And we have even more confidence that we will achieve our EPS-adjusted guidance of $5.25 to $5.75 for the full year. And we continue to expect growth in adjusted automotive free cash flow to nearly $6 billion in 2016.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

But in addition in the first quarter, we had launch-related costs from both a marketing and a manufacturing perspective in the range of $200 million. We very clearly talked about an increase in engineering expense in 2016 versus the prior year to support our very aggressive product launch cadence. And that, obviously, has had an impact in Q1. But as we've talked about in the past, broadly speaking, starting at a company level Rod, we said that incremental material, logistics performance, savings in manufacturing and GBS would more than offset increased fixed costs associated with D&A, marketing and engineering as we went through that product launch cadence. And that's playing out as we expected from a total company level. In North America, we cycle through and we're talking to you early next February, I would expect that to be relatively flattish when I think about material cost performance, logistics performance and the net fixed cost increase year-over-year.

Well, certainly, as we go through the launch cadence, not only on passenger cars and new entries in the Cadillac portfolio and refreshing the oldest crossover lineup, we would expect to see that profit dynamic shift and, obviously, improve those profit pools in passenger cars and crossovers vis-à-vis trucks. The other thing that's just mathematically impacting that shift from the 2014 cadence, 2015 cadence, we're selling more vehicles in Mexico. And obviously, there are more passenger cars there, and they are lower priced, lower profit, obviously, lower cost, and that's having an impact as well. Relative to trucks, the way you protect your profit pool in trucks and SUVs: great products, great brands, continue to take advantage of that, align supply and demand and continue to drive cost efficiency. And our trucks, well into their life cycle, continue to perform very well. We had just under 38% retail share in the first quarter. We continue to lead in the industry. We just launched a refreshed truck, which will carry us to the next-generation truck. And we feel very confident that we'll be able to protect those pools because we've got great products."

And we're offsetting that impact through improved -- significantly improved mix and you saw some of those results: the Envision, as an SUV, sales up significantly; the Baojun 560; we're launching critical new products like the Cadillac CT6 and the XT5. So mix has been a mitigant to the price headwinds as well as carryover material performance. And kind of when I look at those 2 together, they kind of offset the price headwinds and where you see the benefit at least on an aggregate equity income or profit perspective is volume. And we would expect to see that play out. Obviously, we continue to focus very much on cost efficiency, both material logistics and fixed cost.

Thanks for joining. I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margins",912,"Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margins in China; profitability in Europe; and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, earnings per share diluted adjusted and return on invested capital. 
Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion, and we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our very strong first half performance, our current outlook for the second -- and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January. 
As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe so let me just touch on those briefly. In North America, we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full-line manufacturer. And I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. 
We have the best Q2 light truck retail sales in 9 years and the best midsize retail pickup sales in 11 years. Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia, and we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers.
As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a great mix of MPVs and SUVs and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. 
Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by 2 really strong products, the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision. 
In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel has also outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year. And we have more products coming in the second half with the new Safira and then refreshed Mokka X.
In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business.
We are also -- as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers, and this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Cruze provides a unique software capability, and when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving. We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven City and residential car sharing has grown to now to 5 markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C. 
And GM and the Lyft Express drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just 4 months. And they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year, we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us and specifically our Cruise Automation operation recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance. 
So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter and I'm extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck."

I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results",1204,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year.
The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last 4 quarters. 
Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the 2016 calendar year. 
As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10%-plus EBIT-adjusted margins for 4 of the last 5 quarters, and over the last 4 quarters has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins.
And fundamentally supporting our business is a U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year. We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. 
As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million despite a much more challenging economic environment, fundamentally in Brazil.
Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of breakeven or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT-adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over $400 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the U.K., and let me provide some commentary on Brexit. Clearly, things are still fluid and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from a free movement of goods and people and continued free movement of goods and people. 
Certainly, we made substantial progress towards our target to breakeven by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to breakeven for the year, as evidenced by our positive first half performance. 
The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the U.K. automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turnaround plan in Europe.
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year. And we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year.
We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. 
We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock. Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective.
Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target.
Turning to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original time line.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit. As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which should be another record year for the company.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Second quarter, strong pricing on both the new launches as we expected and guided earlier in the year as well as carryover pricing. And we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs. I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches that carryover pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of, we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10-plus percent margin but that's kind of the big picture on that. Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July. I want to just make sure that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year '16 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year '17 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year. On Europe, relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year tended up to $400 million headwind reflects our -- if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year, and the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling, that reflects any impact of the hedge rolloff than anything else. So that's on all-in number right now, again assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year."

Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or an economist technology. Clearly, the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that and the fact that we've already got cars on the road speaks to that.

So I think that ultimately, there's a number of moving pieces in the second half but certainly, we would expect to see strong performance.

First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America. Wanted to get your assessment on the overall industry's discipline. Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable? And then the second question is, there's a going concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 time frame. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future?"

Relative to industry capacity pricing and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years. Nothing alarming. It appears that from our perspective, the industry is continuing to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward. So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes, strong pricing in chuck SUVs, crossovers, weakness and passenger cars. But by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization, hence, our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet. Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question indirectly or directly earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles. We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and/or off-lease as a supply for Lyft drivers. And we think that's going to have a pretty significant take-up. We have our Factory Pre-Owned Collection as well where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction and make available our used car fleet from General Motors Company cars daily rental, et cetera. All of those are really to make sure that there's good supply-demand balance looking forward and early days but generally on track."

Incremental DNA because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches, incremental launch cost from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products, incremental engineering again in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter, we had pretty significant manufacturing launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume.

When you look at the current environment, that drives it as well. So I think we're going to have a good discussion as we do this in-term review. But I want to reiterate, we have done a lot of work to have the right portfolio, but I think we also have to make sure that the targets comprehend that customers ultimately choose what vehicles they're going to buy."

We have a very strong distribution network. I think the strongest dealer body when you look across the globe, the Chevrolet brand is incredibly strong. So we have a very strong core business franchise in South America. And I think the team has done a very good job over the last couple of years of really looking at the market conditions, taking cost out again on all drivers to get to the point that Chuck made when we're talking about Europe. And we brought in that they were demonstrated success in South America of really looking at how to take cost and how to drive and increase from a revenue perspective. So we see that business is important. Obviously disappointing right now with the macroeconomic conditions that no one knows for sure how long they last but they're lingering. But we're well positioned and have seen improvement in the first half of this year from the first half of last year even in a more difficult macroeconomic environment. So very important business for us, and we know that it has huge potential as we move forward. As it relates to technology, whether it's connectivities have already deployed and will continue to grow that over the next couple of years. We'll continue to also see what the receptivity is from an electrification perspective. And from an autonomous perspective but it will be customer-driven clearly, we have the technology and the capability to do it."

Obviously, that's something that we continuously evaluate as kind of the characteristics of the business changes. So the quick answer is no on any change to segment reporting at this time. I'm not going to give you kind of our fixed variable perspective on a go-forward basis. I would say from -- our real focus is to continue to maintain breakeven point in the U.S. at a 10 million to 11 million SAAR. And that is driven by variable profit improvement and the overall level of fixed cost. I would say importantly, when you look at costs, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance, cost performance is relatively flat. And we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low breakeven point. So I kind of think about cost overall, both variable costs, especially the performance aspects of that, the commercial performance against fixed cost increases."

Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margin",913,"Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margins in China; profitability in Europe; and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, earnings per share diluted adjusted and return on invested capital. 
Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion. And we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our very strong first half performance, our current outlook for the second -- and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January. 
As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe. So let me just touch on those briefly. In North America, we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full-line manufacturer, and I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. 
We had the best Q2 light truck retail sales in 9 years and the best midsize retail pickup sales in 11 years. 
Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia, and we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers.
As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a great mix of MPVs and SUVs and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records, with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by 2 really strong products, the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision. 
In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel has also outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year, and we have more products coming in the second half with the new Zafira and the refreshed Mokka X.
In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business.
We are also -- as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers, and this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cruise provides a unique software capability. And when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving. 
We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven City and residential car sharing has grown now to 5 markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C. And GM and the Lyft Express Drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just 4 months, and they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year, we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us, and specifically our Cruise Automation operations, recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance. 
So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter, and I am extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck."

I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. 
In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last 4 quarters. 
Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the 2016 calendar year. 
As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10%-plus EBIT-adjusted margins for 4 of the last 5 quarters and, over the last 4 quarters, has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins. And fundamentally supporting our business is a U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year. We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. 
As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago, and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million despite a much more challenging economic environment, fundamentally in Brazil.
Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of breakeven or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT-adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over. $400 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the U.K., and let me provide some commentary on Brexit. 
Clearly, things are still fluid, and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from a free movement of goods and people -- and continued free movement of goods and people. Certainly, we've made substantial progress towards our target to breakeven by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to breakeven for the year, as evidenced by our positive first half performance. 
The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the U.K. automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turnaround plan in Europe.
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year, and we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year.
We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock. 
Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective.
Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target.
Turning to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note, because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original time line.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016, as Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit. As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which should be another record year for the company.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Second quarter, strong pricing on both new launches, as we expected and guided earlier in the year, as well as carryover pricing. And we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs. I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches, but carryover pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10-plus percent margin, but that's kind of the big picture on that. Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July, I want to just make sure that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year '16 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year '17 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year. On Europe, relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year tended up to $400 million headwind reflects our -- if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year, and the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling, that reflects an impact of the hedge roll-off than anything else. So that's an all-in number right now, again assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year."

When you look at Express Drive, and I talked about how we're expanding the launch, that's something that is obviously positive from a Lyft perspective but very positive for us because it gives us an opportunity to take vehicles coming off a lease or coming off rental and put them into this, which is a better place to put the vehicles and also allows us to grow our residuals. Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or leading in autonomous technology. Clearly, the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that, and the fact that we've already got cars on the road, I think, speaks to that.

So I think that, ultimately, there's a number of moving pieces in the second half, but certainly, we would expect to see strong performance. Lease penetration thus far in the first half of the year for us has run in the 28% range or so, a little bit above historical levels. We would expect to see that moderate over time. And one of the reasons that we're so focused on building Express Drive, reducing daily rental and everything else is because we know that lease returns are going to increase, the used car market is going to normalize, and we're taking proactive actions to improve our residuals, improve our used car values for that time frame."

Capitalize on the fact that we think we have, in our -- in partnership with LG, demonstrated the cell technology and -- which, by the way, we own the IP for our cell chemistry. Putting that into the marketplace and we're going to look to see how quickly that expands from an electrification perspective. From an OnStar, agree. I mean I think we've, in the last couple of years, really accelerated, have a true leadership when we look at having OnStar, that connectivity across 4 continents. And we're continuing to look at ways to monetize that, and that's something that's accelerating. And then with autonomous, to your point, that's one of the reasons we did the Lyft alliance, is we recognized early that the fastest way to get the technology into customers' hands and to really learn and be driven by what customer expectations are is to get it into our ridesharing fleet and get it out there. So I think we're demonstrating different behavior with how we're getting the technology and the innovation and the technological advancements we've done into the marketplace more quickly, and I'd love to tell you that's something I focus on every day."

First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America. Wanted to get your assessment on the overall industry's discipline. Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable? And then the second question is, there's a growing concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 time frame. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or Maven programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future?"

Relative to industry capacity, pricing and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years, nothing alarming. It appears that, from our perspective, the industry is continuing to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward. So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes. Strong pricing in trucks, SUVs, crossovers, weakness in passenger cars. But by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization, hence our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet. Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question indirectly or directly earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles. We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and/or off-lease as a supply for Lyft drivers, and we think that's going to have a pretty significant take-up. We have our Factory Pre-Owned Collection as well, where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction and make available our used car fleet from General Motors Co., cars, daily rental, et cetera.

Fixed cost, that is very consistent with what we talked about, incremental D&A because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches, incremental launch costs from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products, incremental engineering, again, in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter, we had pretty significant manufacturing, launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume.

I would say, importantly, when you look at costs, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance. Cost performance is relatively flat, and we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low breakeven point.

That's already underway. There's an opportunity to cross market, and I think that's something we're just beginning to look at. Clearly, getting Lyft customers into our vehicles through Express Drive gives them exposure to the cars from a styling, from a technology, the whole value proposition that we have across our brands and GM products. And then demonstrating autonomous capability in a sharing environment. So those are the 4 pillars the alliance was on. As I said, those are all on track and are accomplishing exactly what we intended to do."

We know the industry well. We know it comes with challenges and twists and turns, but we also know it comes with opportunities. I think we've shown in this quarter and quarter after quarter that we have the right mindset and are holding ourselves accountable to overcome headwinds, to seize opportunities and to meet our commitments with no excuses. 
The leadership across the company, which I'm very proud of, are pushing themselves to beat the targets we put in front of us. They want to win, and they want to continue to drive value for our customers and for our owners. So we'll continue to execute our plan with discipline to keep driving profitable growth, generating strong returns on invested capital and creating shareholder value as we really focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we do.

Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margin",913,"Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margins in China; profitability in Europe; and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, earnings per share diluted adjusted and return on invested capital. 
Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion. And we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our very strong first half performance, our current outlook for the second -- and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January. 
As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe. So let me just touch on those briefly. In North America, we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full-line manufacturer, and I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. 
We had the best Q2 light truck retail sales in 9 years and the best midsize retail pickup sales in 11 years. 
Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia, and we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers.
As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a great mix of MPVs and SUVs and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records, with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by 2 really strong products, the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision. 
In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel has also outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year, and we have more products coming in the second half with the new Zafira and the refreshed Mokka X.
In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business.
We are also -- as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers, and this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cruise provides a unique software capability. And when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving. 
We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven City and residential car sharing has grown now to 5 markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C. And GM and the Lyft Express Drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just 4 months, and they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year, we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us, and specifically our Cruise Automation operations, recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance. 
So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter, and I am extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck."

I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted resul",1206,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. 
In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last 4 quarters. 
Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the 2016 calendar year. 
As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10%-plus EBIT-adjusted margins for 4 of the last 5 quarters and, over the last 4 quarters, has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins. And fundamentally supporting our business is a U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year. We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. 
As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago, and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million despite a much more challenging economic environment, fundamentally in Brazil.
Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of breakeven or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT-adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over $400 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the U.K., and let me provide some commentary on Brexit. 
Clearly, things are still fluid, and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from a free movement of goods and people -- and continued free movement of goods and people. Certainly, we've made substantial progress towards our target to breakeven by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to breakeven for the year, as evidenced by our positive first half performance. 
The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the U.K. automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turnaround plan in Europe.
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year, and we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year.
We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock. 
Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective.
Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target.
Turning to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note, because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original time line.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016, as Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit. As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which should be another record year for the company.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Second quarter, strong pricing on both new launches, as we expected and guided earlier in the year, as well as carryover pricing. And we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs. I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches, but carryover pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10-plus percent margin, but that's kind of the big picture on that. Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July, I want to just make sure that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year '16 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year '17 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year. On Europe, relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year, tended [ph] up to $400 million headwind, reflects our -- if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year, and the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling, that reflects any impact of the hedge roll-off than anything else. So that's an all-in number right now, again assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year."

Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or leading in autonomous technology. Clearly, the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that, and the fact that we've already got cars on the road, I think, speaks to that.

Again, I would look at all of these in the context of we're driving this business for sustainable 10-plus percent margins. We expect the second half to be strong like the first half was from a North American perspective. Clearly, one of the benefits of cycling through the daily rental is some of the challenges that we had on daily rental auction losses. So I think that, ultimately, there's a number of moving pieces in the second half, but certainly, we would expect to see strong performance. Lease penetration thus far in the first half of the year for us has run in the 28% range or so, a little bit above historical levels. We would expect to see that moderate over time. And one of the reasons that we're so focused on building Express Drive, reducing daily rental and everything else is because we know that lease returns are going to increase, the used car market is going to normalize, and we're taking proactive actions to improve our residuals, improve our used car values for that time frame."

Capitalize on the fact that we think we have, in our -- in partnership with LG, demonstrated the cell technology and -- which, by the way, we own the IP for our cell chemistry, putting that into the marketplace. And we're going to look to see how quickly that expands from an electrification perspective. From an OnStar, agree. I mean I think we've, in the last couple of years, really accelerated, have a true leadership when we look at having OnStar, that connectivity across 4 continents. And we're continuing to look at ways to monetize that, and that's something that's accelerating. And then with autonomous, to your point, that's one of the reasons we did the Lyft alliance, is we recognized early that the fastest way to get the technology into customers' hands and to really learn and be driven by what customer expectations are is to get it into our ridesharing fleet and get it out there. So I think we're demonstrating different behavior with how we're getting the technology and the innovation and the technological advancements we've done into the marketplace more quickly, and I'll also tell you that's something I focus on every day."

First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America.

Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable? And then the second question is, there's a growing concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 time frame. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or Maven programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future?"

Relative to industry capacity, pricing and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years, nothing alarming. It appears that, from our perspective, the industry is continuing to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward. So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes. Strong pricing in trucks, SUVs, crossovers, weakness in passenger cars. But by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization, hence our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet. Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question indirectly or directly earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles. We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and/or off-lease as a supply for Lyft drivers, and we think that's going to have a pretty significant take-up. We have our Factory Pre-Owned Collection as well, where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction and make available our used car fleet from General Motors Co., cars, daily rental, et cetera. All of those are really to make sure that there's good supply-demand balance looking forward. And early days, but generally on track."

Fixed cost, that is very consistent with what we talked about, incremental D&A because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches; incremental launch costs from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products; incremental engineering, again, in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter, we had pretty significant manufacturing, launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume.

We continue to believe that we can execute our plan, including our product launches, improve mix from an SUV perspective, continue efficiencies to maintain strong margins and strong equity income going forward. And I'll have -- we'll have more to say about 2017 early next year. I would say, from where we're sitting today, we would expect to deliver the performance that we talked about earlier this year in China."

We wanted to size up, again, based on the current economic conditions, what the impact would be for the rest of this year. And that, I think, based on today's assumptions, is not a bad planning assumption. We will look across the businesses. We've demonstrated that we would do it not only in Europe but in other parts of the world to ensure that we are taking the actions that are necessary to drive this business to the kind of performance that we need to generate, the whole laundry list. We will look to optimize channel mix in the U.K. We will look to pricing and, to the extent possible, price to offset any lingering FX exposure. We will look to optimize our overall cost structure, whether it's in the U.K. or Europe, to mitigate these things. And that may or may not involve footprint and other actions that we'll take. We'll look to optimize our material costs. I mean, we will go through the whole list of drivers. And the team has been doing that for the last 3 or 4 years, and we'll continue to do that. And this is another speed bump along the way, but we're just going to have to deal with it."

We've demonstrated success in South America of really looking at how to take costs out and how to drive and increase from a revenue perspective. So we see that business is important, obviously disappointing right now with the macroeconomic conditions that no one knows for sure how long they'll last but they're lingering.

Obviously, that's something that we continuously evaluate as kind of the characteristics of the business changes. So the quick answer is no on any change to segment reporting at this time. I'm not going to give you kind of our fixed, variable perspective on a go-forward basis. I would say from -- our real focus is to continue to maintain breakeven point in the U.S. at a 10 million to 11 million SAAR, and that is driven by variable profit improvement and the overall level of fixed cost. I would say, importantly, when you look at costs, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance. Cost performance is relatively flat, and we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low breakeven point. So I kind of think about cost overall, both variable costs, especially the performance aspects of that, the commercial performance, against fixed cost increases."

Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margin",913,"Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included: record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America; record sales and strong margins in China; profitability in Europe; and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, earnings per share diluted adjusted and return on invested capital. 
Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion. And we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our very strong first half performance, our current outlook for the second -- and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January. 
As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe. So let me just touch on those briefly. In North America, we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full-line manufacturer, and I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. 
We had the best Q2 light truck retail sales in 9 years and the best midsize retail pickup sales in 11 years. 
Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia, and we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers.
As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a great mix of MPVs and SUVs and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records, with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by 2 really strong products, the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision. 
In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel has also outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year, and we have more products coming in the second half with the new Zafira and the refreshed Mokka X.
In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business.
We are also -- as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers, and this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cruise provides a unique software capability. And when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving. 
We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven City and residential car sharing has grown now to 5 markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C. And GM and the Lyft Express Drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just 4 months, and they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year, we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us, and specifically our Cruise Automation operations, recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance. 
So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter, and I am extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck."

I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted resul",1206,"Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. 
In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last 4 quarters. 
Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the 2016 calendar year. 
As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10%-plus EBIT-adjusted margins for 4 of the last 5 quarters and, over the last 4 quarters, has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins. And fundamentally supporting our business is a U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year. We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. 
As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago, and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million despite a much more challenging economic environment, fundamentally in Brazil.
Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of breakeven or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT-adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over $400 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the U.K., and let me provide some commentary on Brexit. 
Clearly, things are still fluid, and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the U.K.'s future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from a free movement of goods and people -- and continued free movement of goods and people. Certainly, we've made substantial progress towards our target to breakeven by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to breakeven for the year, as evidenced by our positive first half performance. 
The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the U.K. automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turnaround plan in Europe.
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year, and we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year.
We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock. 
Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective.
Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target.
Turning to our capital allocation framework. We continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note, because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original time line.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016, as Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit. As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which should be another record year for the company.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Second quarter, strong pricing on both new launches, as we expected and guided earlier in the year, as well as carryover pricing. And we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs. I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches, but carryover pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10-plus percent margin, but that's kind of the big picture on that. Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July, I want to just make sure that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year '16 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year '17 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year. On Europe, relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year, tended [ph] up to $400 million headwind, reflects our -- if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year, and the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling, that reflects any impact of the hedge roll-off than anything else. So that's an all-in number right now, again assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year."

When you look at Express Drive, and I talked about how we're expanding the launch, that's something that is obviously positive from a Lyft perspective, but very positive for us because it gives us an opportunity to take vehicles coming off a lease or coming off rental and put them into this, which is a better place to put the vehicles and also allows us to grow our residuals. Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or leading in autonomous technology. Clearly, the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that, and the fact that we've already got cars on the road, I think, speaks to that.

So I think that, ultimately, there's a number of moving pieces in the second half, but certainly, we would expect to see strong performance. Lease penetration thus far in the first half of the year for us has run in the 28% range or so, a little bit above historical levels. We would expect to see that moderate over time.

So that will be the gating on how quickly we execute the second $4 billion. I'd also point out, and I tried to make note of that in my comments, we are dealing with seasonality from a cash flow perspective so we always need to think that share buybacks will generally be weighted towards the second half of the year versus the first half just because of the low seasonality in the first quarter."

I mean I think we've, in the last couple of years, really accelerated, have a true leadership when we look at having OnStar, that connectivity across 4 continents. And we're continuing to look at ways to monetize that, and that's something that's accelerating. And then with autonomous, to your point, that's one of the reasons we did the Lyft alliance, is we recognized early that the fastest way to get the technology into customers' hands and to really learn and be driven by what customer expectations are is to get it into our ridesharing fleet and get it out there.

First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America. Wanted to get your assessment on the overall industry's discipline. Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable? And then the second question is, there's a growing concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 time frame. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or Maven programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future?"

Relative to industry capacity, pricing and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years, nothing alarming. It appears that, from our perspective, the industry is continuing to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward. So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes. Strong pricing in trucks, SUVs, crossovers, weakness in passenger cars. But by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization, hence our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet. Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question indirectly or directly earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles. We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and/or off-lease as a supply for Lyft drivers, and we think that's going to have a pretty significant take-up. We have our Factory Pre-Owned Collection as well, where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction and make available our used car fleet from General Motors Co., cars, daily rental, et cetera. All of those are really to make sure that there's good supply-demand balance looking forward. And early days, but generally on track."

So I would look at this mix number as being primarily related to the daily rental volume that rolled through volume. Fixed cost, that is very consistent with what we talked about, incremental D&A because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches; incremental launch costs from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products; incremental engineering, again, in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter, we had pretty significant manufacturing, launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume. So I would not take this $800 million and multiply it by 4 from a run rate perspective.

We have a very strong product portfolio there, with a lot of model refreshes that are happening this year, what are very, I'll say, economically done from a capital deployment perspective. We have a very strong distribution network. I think the strongest dealer body -- when you look across the globe, the Chevrolet brand is incredibly strong. So we have a very strong core business franchise in South America. And I think the team has done a very good job over the last couple of years of really looking at the market conditions, taking cost out, again, on all drivers. It gets to the point that Chuck made when we were talking about Europe. We've run that play. We've demonstrated success in South America of really looking at how to take costs out and how to drive and increase from a revenue perspective. So we see that business is important, obviously disappointing right now with the macroeconomic conditions that no one knows for sure how long they'll last but they're lingering. But we're well positioned and have seen improvement in the first half of this year from the first half of last year even in a more difficult macroeconomic environment. So very important business for us, and we know that it has huge potential as we move forward. As it relates to technology, whether it's -- connectivity, we've already deployed, and we'll continue to grow that over the next couple of years. We'll continue to also see what the receptivity is from an electrification perspective. And from an autonomous perspective, but it will be customer-driven clearly, we have the technology and the capability to do it."

Obviously, that's something that we continuously evaluate as kind of the characteristics of the business changes. So the quick answer is no on any change to segment reporting at this time. I'm not going to give you kind of our fixed, variable perspective on a go-forward basis. I would say from -- our real focus is to continue to maintain breakeven point in the U.S. at a 10 million to 11 million SAAR, and that is driven by variable profit improvement and the overall level of fixed cost. I would say, importantly, when you look at costs, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance. Cost performance is relatively flat, and we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low breakeven point. So I kind of think about cost overall, both variable costs, especially the performance aspects of that, the commercial performance, against fixed cost increases."

Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights.
Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to a $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points and EPS diluted adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year, and ROIC-adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing 4-quarter basis was an all-time record, continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share. We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early, and we will be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter. 
We had very strong performances in North America and China, so let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in 5 years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years. 
Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers, and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes. 
We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives, so the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have 8 of the 2017 North America Car, Truck and Utility of the Year semifinalists. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV. We have the GMC Acadia. We have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision. I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from Consumer Reports for Buick. 
Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through -- and through September, GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had 6 new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brands. Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano notchback, and also for Baojun, driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730. 
In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATS-L and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%. For Europe, through the first 9 months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the U.K. referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. 
But even with the Brexit situation, our Opel/Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed Mokka X and Zafira that are laying a foundation for future growth. In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 -- through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018, and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the products we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target, and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility, where we see tremendous return potential. 
We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia, the first 2 models on our new crossover platform, are nearly fully ramped up. And the new Buick, LaCrosse follows the Malibu on the midsize platform, and the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture. Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple life cycles, and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business.
From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling. We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. 
Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth that [ph] we've launched 9 months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016, with nearly 10,000 vehicles. And we've launched 3 services on the Maven platform: the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So we really have an energized team running our Maven business. 
When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year. And we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we had nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our smart driver service since its launch in July. They can use the service to anonymously seek insurance discount for good driving practices.
So every running quarter, we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to",1290,"Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. 
The positive results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first 9 months of the year. Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we are on track to meet our commitments and deliver another year of strong results.
In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the year. In fact, North America has achieved 10-plus percent EBIT-adjusted margins for 5 out of the last 6 quarters.
The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S. light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years. However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view.
Clearly, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand and through disciplined pricing. 
In fact, on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly underpace the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period.
Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year change overpace ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. 
Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our days supply is well positioned at 79 days as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4.
Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect days supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. 
Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and we'll take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels.
As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives as a percentage of transaction price are also expected to trend down as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is working and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry.
Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, about equal to a year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. 
In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first 9 months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the U.K. referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades. As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress in our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending as we make portfolio investments and our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan. 
As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality. However, we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders in line with our capital allocation framework. We have returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company. 
We are in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017 as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Absent some announcement by the government, we expect Q4 to be strong as well in the range of 9% to 10% up year-over-year. We've seen so far in October the industry and sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income consistent with our guidance to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year. And pricing continues to be a significant challenge. We've been able to offset that on a year-to-date basis with improvements in mix and continued material cost efficiencies. So it feels to me kind of more the same in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the first 3 quarters of the year."

As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running not only in San Francisco but also in Scottsdale so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day. And I'm very pleased with the team's performance. As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ridesharing environment, hence the alliance that we did with Lyft as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ridesharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced and have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn. And so that path is very much on track. But I will say what is going to gauge our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today's U.S. streets are human error. And so we think we can make a big dent on that, so will be gated by safety. But once we feel that we've got the right system working with our regulators, we have the scale to put those vehicles into production extremely quickly."

One is just was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. You've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course, everybody's noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors. Ram incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter, we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression anew. This morning, FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018. And I think IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook? And maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year."

Let me start at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate, given our dealer footprint and what's really driven the increase in inventory, which is filling out inventory on newly-launched products and new entries that we didn't have before like the CT6 or the Envision, as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover so that we have sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly, the market in general is getting more competitive, and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective. But I step back and look at the overall strength of our Three Truck Strategy. The light duty, heavy duty and midsize trucks, we've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product. Relative to the truck capacity coming on stream, we could sell more vehicles if we had more vehicles from a truck perspective today. And hence, one of the clear focus area is on the retail side of the business. We also need to peel the onion a bit on where is the industry actually adding capacity. Is it in trucks? Is it in SUVs? Is it in crossovers? Because again, we believe we're well positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs, and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well. To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint. And I think there's 2 or 3 fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running a different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up. We're less reliant on less profitable daily rental and that's showing up in our results. We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence. So this year, we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio. And next year, we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and midsize over the next 12 to 18 months and that's critical. That's a lot of volume, it's highly profitable and we expect to see that. We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency. And as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher. And that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance, and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment, that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America like we have done over the past couple of years."

And obviously, what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improve mix and material performance, which is fundamentally offset price headwinds. Obviously, this year, the industry is running stronger than we expected because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive. If that was to end and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that there could be some volatility in maybe the first and second quarter of next year. But the -- we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units. And as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low single-digit range over the next number of years. Again, it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective. We have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue, and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence. And I would say similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years as well as Cadillac products, which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins, over time, to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs but still be generating strong overall equity income."

First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60% and generally you're in the 50% range so that's first. You're dealing with that aspect. Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market, so regular cab work type trucks and things like that. And I think that you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive, and we were losing share at the lower end but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth. And I think that's what we're seeing play out. So I wouldn't paint the whole truck market pricing dynamic with one brush. You almost need to look and peel that onion back a layer or 2.

We will continue to reevaluate that depending on market dynamics but -- and we do on a regular basis, but there was a lot of work to come up with that $20 billion.

And I think I said early days but an indication would be take the $400 million and multiply it by 2, right? A full year impact of the second half pound sterling only without a lot of insight on what was happening from the industry perspective and everything else. And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance, so was just a general directional answer to a conversation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifests itself was $100 million in the third quarter, so that would leave a residual $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason it was more back-end loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in place that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent, and the pound has weakened further since we provided that guidance. So we still expect for the second half of the year in the range of a $400 million headwind associated with Brexit primarily related to the pound sterling. And that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge breakeven in Europe very, very difficult, especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself, take an exchange rate. At the end of Q2, we're at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we're at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position. That in and of itself in 2017, if I was picking a point today, would be significant. But there are a number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come in January but certainly, the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain and very volatile at this point in time. From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter. And frankly, it was even strong in the U.K. but again, when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it but there's a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded. I would expect, and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year, to a certain extent, as OEMs start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1. Our intelligence suggests [indiscernible] followed not to that full level but followed as well. And that, in and of itself, along with consumer sentiment issues should -- will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So we'll see how that plays out."

We should be through that by the end of 2017. All else equal, that would be worth $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity, again scheduled at the end of '17. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia. I would suggest we are looking at all of our operations there. And as we've indicated in the Q, there could be additional significant restructurings, depending on whether we can identify a path forward because we're just not going to absorb the kind of losses that we've seen there on an ongoing basis. So I would suggest there's likely more actions to come."

What I would say is if you look at our vehicle, there's tremendous safety features on them already, whether it's airbags or the lane detection, automatic brake emergency braking, near object detection and even when you back up from a perpendicular perspective. A lot of the technologies on the vehicle today that we have put on offset, to a large extent, the technology for safety by finding cost improvements, material cost improvements and just overall design and efficiency of the vehicle. So -- and the way I look at it is all this technology is making the drivers safer today on the road. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous because you really then get to a point again if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen. There's an incident number of situations that drivers or vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement. But -- so I don't see it as if $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this, this not the way would look at it we continue to look at how we incorporate this technology into the vehicle looking at affordability today and then with -- I would call that the evolutionary path and then autonomous is more of the revolutionary path.

We'll continue that discussion. Maybe Chuck, a question for you then lastly. You mentioned a goal of $6 billion [ph] of adjusted auto free cash flow. When I look year-to-date though and take the $10 billion of operating of automotive operating cash flow and I take out CapEx, I get a number of $3.2 billion. So I guess when you say adjusted, there's some changes you're making to the number because you're not implying you're going to make almost $3 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?"

You're narrowing that gap this year. Maybe if you include the pension funding, you're getting close to half, like even narrow it to maybe to do $6 of earnings, you need a $3 of free cash flow a share. But you still have that gap. So the question, Chuck, is how will this gap -- will this gap be narrowed so that your $6 or so of earnings can really reflect cash earnings as well?

Obviously, free cash flow would add back in because it's debt for debt, so the $5.2 billion is the right GAAP or the right adjusted free cash flow number and consistent with our $6 billion target free cash flow at the end of the year and what we'll apply to our capital allocation framework. When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes. And that's going to be and has been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than DNA because we've underspent for a number of years, and it's going to take a while to catch that up. And pensions. At the end of the day, we have pension income that is noncash and that gets reversed. So I would say that as we look forward, the way I think about it is our conversion ratio should improve on a go-forward basis because incremental EBIT is highly leveraged to cash flow on a go-forward basis, and that's what I talked about before."

So we definitely see that. I think one of the things though and this is where we also have an advantage with our paycheck and engineering center, that we can really leverage the supply base and that volume in China to really help us globally from an electrification perspective, and we intend to do that. I would also say from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move and will be announcing the next year that with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification. To say who's going to be -- we clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching both cars and trucks that are getting very good market perception.

Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights.
Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to a $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points and EPS diluted adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year, and ROIC-adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing 4-quarter basis was an all-time record, continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share. We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early, and we will be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter. 
We had very strong performances in North America and China, so let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in 5 years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years. 
Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers, and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes. 
We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives, so the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have 8 of the 2017 North America Car, Truck and Utility of the Year semifinalists. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV. We have the GMC Acadia. We have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision. I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from Consumer Reports for Buick. 
Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through -- and through September, GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had 6 new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brands. Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano notchback, and also for Baojun, driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730. 
In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATS-L and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%. For Europe, through the first 9 months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the U.K. referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. 
But even with the Brexit situation, our Opel/Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed Mokka X and Zafira that are laying a foundation for future growth. In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 -- through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018, and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the products we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target, and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility, where we see tremendous return potential. 
We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia, the first 2 models on our new crossover platform, are nearly fully ramped up. And the new Buick, LaCrosse follows the Malibu on the midsize platform, and the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture. Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple life cycles, and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business.
From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling. We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. 
Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth we've launched 9 months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016, with nearly 10,000 vehicles. And we've launched 3 services on the Maven platform: the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So we really have an energized team running our Maven business. 
When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year, and we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we had nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our smart driver service since its launch in July. They can use the service to anonymously seek insurance discount for good driving practices.
So every running quarter, we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to",1291,"Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. 
The positive results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first 9 months of the year. Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we are on track to meet our commitments and deliver another year of strong results.
In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the year. In fact, North America has achieved 10-plus percent EBIT-adjusted margins for 5 out of the last 6 quarters.
The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S. light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years. However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view.
Clearly, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand and through disciplined pricing. In fact, on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly under pace the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year, but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period.
Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year change over pace, ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. 
Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our day supply is well positioned at 79 days as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4.
Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect day supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. 
Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and we'll take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels.
As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives, as a percentage of transaction price, are also expected to trend down, as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is working, and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry.
Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, about equal to 1 year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. 
In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures, and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first 9 months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the U.K. referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades. As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress on our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending as we make portfolio investments and our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan. 
As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality. However, we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders in line with our capital allocation framework. We have returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company. 
We're in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017, as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers, as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Absent some announcement by the government, we expect Q4 to be strong as well in the range of 9% to 10% up year-over-year. We've seen so far in October the industry and sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income, consistent with our guidance, to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year, and pricing continues to be a significant challenge. We've been able to offset that on a year-to-date basis with improvements in mix, and continued material cost efficiencies. So it feels to me kind of more the same in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the first 3 quarters of the year."

As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running, not only in San Francisco, but also in Scottsdale, so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles, but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day. And I'm very pleased with the team's performance. As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ridesharing environment, hence, the alliance that we did with Lyft, as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ridesharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced, you're going to have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn, and so that path is very much on track. But I will say what is going to gate our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today's U.S. streets are human error. And so we think we can make a big dent on that, so we'll be gated by safety. But once we feel that we've got the right system working with our regulators, we have the scale to put those vehicles into production extremely quickly."

One is just was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. You've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course, everybody's noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors. Ram incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter, we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression anew. This morning, FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018, and I think IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook? And maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year."

Let me start at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate, given our dealer footprint and what's really driven the increase in inventory, which is filling out inventory on newly-launched products and new entries that we didn't have before, like the CT6 or the Envision, as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover, so that we have sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly, the market in general is getting more competitive, and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective. But I step back and look at the overall strength of our Three Truck Strategy. The light duty, heavy duty and midsized trucks, we've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product. Relative to the truck capacity coming on stream, we could sell more vehicles if we had more vehicles from a truck perspective today, and hence, one of the clear focus area is on the retail side of the business. You also need to peel the onion a bit on where are we -- where is the industry actually adding capacity. Is it in trucks? Is it in SUVs? Is it in crossovers? Because again, we believe we're well positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs, and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well. To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint, and I think there's 2 or 3 fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running a different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up. We're less reliant on less profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in our results. We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence. So this year, we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio. And next year, we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and midsize over the next 12 to 18 months and that's critical. That's a lot of volume. It's highly profitable, and we expect to see that. We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency. And as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher. And that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance, and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment, that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America, like we have done over the past couple of years."

We would expect overall production to be up in the fourth quarter marginally from the third quarter. And obviously, what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else, but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improve mix and material performance, which is fundamentally offset price headwinds. Obviously, this year, the industry is running stronger than we expected because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive. If that was to end, and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that there could be some volatility in maybe the first and second quarter of next year. But the -- we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units. And as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low-single-digit range over the next number of years. Again, it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective, and we have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue, and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence. And I would say, similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years, as well as Cadillac products, which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics, but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins, over time, to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs, but still be generating strong overall equity income."

First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60%, and generally, you're in the 50% range so that's first. You're dealing with that aspect. Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market, so regular cab work type trucks and things like that. And I think that you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive, and we were losing share at the lower end, but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth, and I think that's what we're seeing play out. So I wouldn't paint the whole truck market pricing dynamic with one brush. You almost need to look and peel that onion back 1 layer or 2. We're still performing exceptionally well up level, crew cab, our new up level additions and higher trims that we're rolling out. And we've seen improved transaction prices and improved actually profitability on the current truck platform on a year-over-year basis, and despite some of the challenges at the lower end of the market."

And I think I said early days, but an indication would be take the $400 million and multiply it by 2, right? A full year impact of the second half pound sterling only without a lot of insight on what was happening from the industry perspective and everything else. And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance, so it was a general directional answer to a conversation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifests itself was $100 million in the third quarter, so that would leave a residual $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason it was more back-end loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in place that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent, and the pound has weakened further since we provided that guidance. So we still expect for the second half of the year in the range of a $400 million headwind associated with Brexit primarily related to the pound sterling. And that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge of breakeven in Europe very, very difficult, especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself, pick an exchange rate. At the end of Q2, we're at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we're at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position, that in and of itself in 2017, if I was picking a point today, would be significant. But there are a number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come in January, but certainly, the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain and very volatile at this point in time. From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter. And frankly, it was even strong in the U.K. but again, when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it, but there's a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded. I would expect, and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year, to a certain extent, as OEMs start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1. Our intelligence suggests Volkswagen followed not to that full level, but followed as well. And that, in and of itself, along with consumer sentiment issues should -- will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So we have to see how that plays out."

All else equal, that would be worth $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity, again, scheduled at the end of '17. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia. I would suggest we are looking at all of our operations there.

So -- and the way I look at it is all this technology is making the drivers safer today on the road. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous because you really then get to a point again if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen. There's an incident number of situations that drivers or vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement, but -- so I don't see it as it's $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this. It's not really the way we look at it.

When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes, and that's going to be and has been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than DNA because we've underspent for a number of years, and it's going to take a while to catch that up, and pensions. At the end of the day, we have pension income that is noncash that gets reversed.

I would say we're also the only OEM that actually manufactures batteries in-country right now. Clearly, we have the strength of the products that we have available to sell globally with the Bolt -- second-generation Bolt as well as the Bolt EV and the Ampera-e, along with many other electrified products in China. So we definitely see that trend. I think one of the things, though, and this is where we also have an advantage with our paycheck engineering center, that we can really leverage the supply base and the -- that volume in China to really help us globally from an electrification perspective, and we intend to do that. I would also say from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move, and we'll be announcing the Ampera-e next year that with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification. To say who's going to be -- we clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching those cars and trucks that are getting very good market reception. And so I think it's too soon to exactly call how the penetration is going to be, but definitely probably more significant than we thought may be 1 a year or 2 ago. And as it relates to -- I mean, clearly, we've got to get the scale and get the engineering work done that we can have minimal impact from a margin perspective."

I would expect, and you're right, typically, depending on how the model changes are going for all of the competition, Q4 has a tendency to ramp down a little bit because you've launched the new model year vehicles for us, specifically, because we're in really good shape from that perspective, but we'd expect the industry broadly to follow that same trend that.

Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights.
Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to a $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points; and EPS diluted adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year, and ROIC-adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing 4-quarter basis was an all-time record, continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share. We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early, and we will be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter. 
We had very strong performances in North America and China, so let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in 5 years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years. 
Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers, and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes. 
We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives, so the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have 8 of the 2017 North America Car, Truck and Utility of the Year semifinalists. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV. We have the GMC Acadia. We have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision. I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from Consumer Reports for Buick. 
Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through -- and through September, GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had 6 new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brands. Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano notchback, and also for Baojun, driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730. 
In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATS-L, and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%. For Europe, through the first 9 months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the U.K. referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. 
But even with the Brexit situation, our Opel/Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed Mokka X and Zafira that are laying a foundation for future growth. In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 -- through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018, and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the progress we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target, and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility, where we see tremendous return potential. 
We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia, the first 2 models on our new crossover platform, are nearly fully ramped up. And the new Buick LaCrosse follows the Malibu on the midsize platform, and the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture. Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple life cycles, and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business.
From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling. We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. 
Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth and was launched 9 months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016, with nearly 10,000 vehicles. And we've launched 3 services on the Maven platform: the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So we really have an energized team running our Maven business. 
When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year, and we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up, with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we had nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our smart driver service since its launch in July. They can use the service to anonymously seek insurance discounts for good driving practices.
So every winning quarter, we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."

I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to",1291,"Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. 
The positive results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first 9 months of the year. Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we are on track to meet our commitments and deliver another year of strong results.
In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the year. In fact, North America has achieved 10-plus percent EBIT-adjusted margins for 5 out of the last 6 quarters.
The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S. light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years. However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view.
Clearly, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand and through disciplined pricing. In fact, on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly under paced the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year, but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period.
Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year change over pace, ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. 
Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our days supply is well positioned at 79 days as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4.
Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect days supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. 
Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and we'll take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels.
As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives, as a percentage of transaction price, are also expected to trend down as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is working, and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry.
Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, about equal to 1 year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. 
In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures, and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first 9 months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the U.K. referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades. As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress on our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending as we make portfolio investments and our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan. 
As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality. However, we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders in line with our capital allocation framework. We have returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company. 
We're in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017, as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers, as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

We've seen so far in October the industry and sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income, consistent with our guidance, to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year, and pricing continues to be a significant challenge.

As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running, not only in San Francisco, but also in Scottsdale, so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles, but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day. And I'm very pleased with the team's performance. As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ridesharing environment, hence, the alliance that we did with Lyft, as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ridesharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced, you're going to have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn, and so that path is very much on track. But I will say what is going to gate our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible, because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today's U.S. streets are human error. And so we think we can make a big dent on that, so we'll be gated by safety. But once we feel that we've got the right system working with our regulators, we have the scale to put those vehicles into production extremely quickly."

One is just was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. You've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course, everybody's noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors. Ram incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter, we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression anew. This morning, FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018, and I think IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook, and maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year?"

Let me start at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate, given our dealer footprint and what's really driven the increase in inventory, which is filling out inventory on newly-launched products and new entries that we didn't have before, like the CT6 or the Envision, as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover, so that we have a sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly, the market in general is getting more competitive, and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective. But I step back and look at the overall strength of our Three Truck Strategy, the light duty, heavy duty and midsized trucks. We've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product. Relative to the truck capacity coming on stream, we could sell more vehicles if we had more vehicles from a truck perspective today and, hence, one of the clear focus area is on the retail side of the business. You also need to peel the onion a bit on where are we -- where is the industry actually adding capacity. Is it in trucks? Is it in SUVs? Is it in crossovers? Because, again, we believe we're well positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs, and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well. To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint, and I think there's 2 or 3 fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running a different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up. We're less reliant on less-profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in our results. We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence. So this year, we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio. And next year, we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and midsize, over the next 12 to 18 months, and that's critical. That's a lot of volume. It's highly profitable, and we expect to see that. We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency. And as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher. And that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance, and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment, that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America, like we have done over the past couple of years."

And obviously, what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else, but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improve mix and material performance, which is fundamentally offset price headwinds. Obviously, this year, the industry is running stronger than we expected because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive. If that was to end, and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that there could be some volatility in maybe the first and second quarter of next year. But then we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units. And as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low-single-digit range over the next number of years. Again, it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective, and we have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue, and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence. And I would say, similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years, as well as Cadillac products, which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics, but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins, over time, to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs, but still be generating strong overall equity income."

First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60%, and generally, you're in the 50% range so that's first. You're dealing with that aspect. Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market, so regular cab work type trucks and things like that. And I think that you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive, and we were losing share at the lower end, but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth, and I think that's what we're seeing play out. So I wouldn't paint the whole truck market pricing dynamic with one brush. You almost need to look and peel that onion back a layer or 2. We're still performing exceptionally well up level, crew cab, our new up level additions and higher trims that we're rolling out.

We will continue to reevaluate that depending on market dynamics, but -- and we do on a regular basis, but there was a lot of work to come up with that $20 billion.

Second, maintain an investment-grade balance sheet, and we're targeting to run the company at a single-A rating because we think that's the right thing to do from a financial risk management perspective and to support GM Financial, which will ultimately lead to significantly improved earnings at the finance company but also at the car company. So we don't -- we feel today, when you look at our overall external debt and the position of our underfunded pensions, that we have the appropriate amount of leverage. We do not want to overlay financial leverage on top of operating leverage in this business because that's another lesson learned from the last significant downturn that we went through."

An",582,"Yes, let me go back to what we talked about in July because I think it was you that asked the question, Ryan, when we were talking about the $400 million impact in the second half of the year, and you kept pushing me on what's the calendar year impact. And I think I said early days, but an indication would be take the $400 million and multiply it by 2, right? A full year impact of the second half pound sterling only without a lot of insight on what was happening from an industry perspective and everything else. And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance, it was a general directional answer to a conversation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifested itself was $100 million in the third quarter, so that would leave a residual of $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason it was more back-end loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in place that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent, and the pound has weakened further since we provided that guidance. So we still expect for the second half of the year in the range of a $400 million headwind associated with Brexit primarily related to the pound sterling. And that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge of breakeven in Europe very, very difficult, especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself, pick an exchange rate. At the end of Q2, we were at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we were at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position. That in and of itself in 2017, if I was picking a point today, would be significant. But there are a number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come in January, but certainly, the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain and very volatile at this point in time. From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter. And frankly, it was even strong in the U.K. but, again, when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it, but there's a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded. I would expect and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year, to a certain extent, as OEMs start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1. Our intelligence suggests Volkswagen followed not to that full level, but followed as well. And that, in and of itself, along with consumer sentiment issues should -- will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So we'll have to see how that plays out."

We should be through that by the end of 2017. All else equal, that would be worth $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity, again, scheduled at the end of '17. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia. I would suggest we are looking at all of our operations there. And as we've indicated in the Q, there could be additional significant restructurings, depending on whether we can identify a path forward, because we're just not going to absorb the kind of losses that we've seen there on an ongoing basis.

What I would say is if you look at our vehicles, there's tremendous safety features on them already, whether it's airbags or the lane detection, automatic brake, emergency braking, rear object detection, even when you back up from a perpendicular perspective. And a lot of the technologies on the vehicle today that we have put on and offset, to a large extent, the technology for safety by finding cost improvements, material cost improvements and just overall design and efficiency of the vehicle. So -- and the way I look at it is all this technology is making the driver safer today on the road. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous because you really then get to a point, again, if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen, there's an infinite number of situations that drivers or vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement, but -- so I don't see it as it's $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this. It's not really the way we look at it. We continue to look at how do we incorporate the safety technology into the vehicle, looking at affordability today, and then with a -- and I would call that the evolutionary path, and then autonomous is more of the revolutionary path.

When I look year-to-date, though, and take the $10 billion of operating of automotive operating cash flow, and I take out CapEx, I get a number of $3.2 billion.

So the $5.2 billion is the right GAAP -- or the right adjusted free cash flow number and consistent with our $6 billion target free cash flow at the end of the year, and what we'll apply to our capital allocation framework. When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes, and that's going to be and has been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than DNA because we've underspent for a number of years, and it's going to take a while to catch that up, and pensions. At the end of the day, we have pension income that is noncash that gets reversed. So I would say that as we look forward, the way I think about it is our conversion ratio should improve on a go-forward basis because incremental EBIT is highly levered to cash flow on a go-forward basis, and that's what I've talked about before."

Clearly, we have the strength of the products that we have available to sell globally with the Volt, second-generation Volt as well as the Bolt EV and the Ampera-e, along with many other electrified products in China. So we definitely see that trend. I think one of the things, though, and this is where we also have an advantage with our PATAC engineering center, that we can really leverage the supply base and the -- that volume in China to really help us globally from an electrification perspective, and we intend to do that. I would also say from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move, and we'll be announcing the Ampera-e next year that with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification. To say who's going to be -- we clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say, though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching, both cars and trucks, that are getting very good market reception.

Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights.
Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to a $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points; and EPS diluted adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year, and ROIC-adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing 4-quarter basis was an all-time record, continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. 
Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share. We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early, and we will be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter. 
We had very strong performances in North America and China, so let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in 5 years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years. 
Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers, and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes. 
We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives, so the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have 8 of the 2017 North America Car, Truck and Utility of the Year semifinalists. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV. We have the GMC Acadia. We have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision. I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from Consumer Reports for Buick. 
Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through -- and through September, GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had 6 new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brands. Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano notchback, and also for Baojun, driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730. 
In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATS-L, and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%. For Europe, through the first 9 months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the U.K. referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. 
But even with the Brexit situation, our Opel/Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed Mokka X and Zafira that are laying a foundation for future growth. In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 -- through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018, and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the progress we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target, and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility, where we see tremendous return potential. 
We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia, the first 2 models on our new crossover platform, are nearly fully ramped up. And the new Buick LaCrosse follows the Malibu on the midsize platform, and the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture. Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple life cycles, and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business.
From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling. We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. 
Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth and was launched 9 months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016, with nearly 10,000 vehicles. And we've launched 3 services on the Maven platform: the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So we really have an energized team running our Maven business. 
When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year, and we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up, with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we had nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our smart driver service since its launch in July. They can use the service to anonymously seek insurance discounts for good driving practices.
So every winning quarter, we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck."
61206100,402271280,1061044,"General Motors Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to",1291,"Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first 9 months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. 
The positive results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first 9 months of the year. Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we are on track to meet our commitments and deliver another year of strong results.
In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10%-plus for the year. In fact, North America has achieved 10-plus percent EBIT-adjusted margins for 5 out of the last 6 quarters.
The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S. light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid-17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years. However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view.
Clearly, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand and through disciplined pricing. In fact, on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly under paced the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year, but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period.
Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year change over pace, ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. 
Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our days supply is well positioned at 79 days as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4.
Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect days supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. 
Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and we'll take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels.
As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives, as a percentage of transaction price, are also expected to trend down as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is working, and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry.
Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of the year, about equal to 1 year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. 
In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures, and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015.
Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first 9 months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the U.K. referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades. As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress on our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first 9 months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending as we make portfolio investments and our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan. 
As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality. However, we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders in line with our capital allocation framework. We have returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017.
Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company. 
We're in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017, as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers, as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe.
That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call."

We've seen so far in October the industry and sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income, consistent with our guidance, to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year, and pricing continues to be a significant challenge. We've been able to offset that on a year-to-date basis with improvements in mix, and continued material cost efficiencies. So it feels to me kind of more the same in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the first 3 quarters of the year."

As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running, not only in San Francisco, but also in Scottsdale, so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles, but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day. And I'm very pleased with the team's performance. As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ridesharing environment, hence, the alliance that we did with Lyft, as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ridesharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced, you're going to have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn, and so that path is very much on track. But I will say what is going to gate our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible, because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today's U.S. streets are human error.

One is just was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. You've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course, everybody's noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors. Ram incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter, we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression anew. This morning, FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018, and I think IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook, and maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year?"

Let me start at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate, given our dealer footprint and what's really driven the increase in inventory, which is filling out inventory on newly-launched products and new entries that we didn't have before, like the CT6 or the Envision, as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover, so that we have a sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly, the market in general is getting more competitive, and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective. But I step back and look at the overall strength of our Three Truck Strategy, the light duty, heavy duty and midsized trucks. We've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product. Relative to the truck capacity coming on stream, we could sell more vehicles if we had more vehicles from a truck perspective today and, hence, one of the clear focus area is on the retail side of the business. You also need to peel the onion a bit on where are we -- where is the industry actually adding capacity. Is it in trucks? Is it in SUVs? Is it in crossovers? Because, again, we believe we're well positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs, and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well. To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint, and I think there's 2 or 3 fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running a different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up. We're less reliant on less-profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in our results. We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence. So this year, we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio. And next year, we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and midsize, over the next 12 to 18 months, and that's critical. That's a lot of volume. It's highly profitable, and we expect to see that. We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency. And as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher. And that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance, and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment, that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America, like we have done over the past couple of years."

And obviously, what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else, but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improve mix and material performance, which is fundamentally offset price headwinds. Obviously, this year, the industry is running stronger than we expected because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive. If that was to end, and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that there could be some volatility in maybe the first and second quarter of next year. But then we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units. And as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low-single-digit range over the next number of years. Again, it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective, and we have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue, and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence. And I would say, similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years, as well as Cadillac products, which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics, but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins, over time, to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs, but still be generating strong overall equity income."

First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60%, and generally, you're in the 50% range so that's first. You're dealing with that aspect. Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market, so regular cab work type trucks and things like that. And I think that you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive, and we were losing share at the lower end, but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth, and I think that's what we're seeing play out.

We will continue to reevaluate that depending on market dynamics, but -- and we do on a regular basis, but there was a lot of work to come up with that $20 billion.

And I think I said early days, but an indication would be take the $400 million and multiply it by 2, right? A full year impact of the second half pound sterling only without a lot of insight on what was happening from an industry perspective and everything else. And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance, it was a general directional answer to a conversation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifested itself was $100 million in the third quarter, so that would leave a residual of $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason it was more back-end loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in place that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent, and the pound has weakened further since we provided that guidance. So we still expect for the second half of the year in the range of a $400 million headwind associated with Brexit primarily related to the pound sterling. And that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge of breakeven in Europe very, very difficult, especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself, pick an exchange rate. At the end of Q2, we were at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we were at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position. That in and of itself in 2017, if I was picking a point today, would be significant. But there are a number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come in January, but certainly, the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain and very volatile at this point in time. From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter. And frankly, it was even strong in the U.K. but, again, when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it, but there's a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded. I would expect and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year, to a certain extent, as OEMs start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1. Our intelligence suggests Volkswagen followed not to that full level, but followed as well. And that, in and of itself, along with consumer sentiment issues should -- will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So we'll have to see how that plays out."

All else equal, that would be worth $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity, again, scheduled at the end of '17. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia.

So -- and the way I look at it is all this technology is making the driver safer today on the road. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous because you really then get to a point, again, if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen, there's an infinite number of situations that drivers or vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement, but -- so I don't see it as it's $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this. It's not really the way we look at it. We continue to look at how do we incorporate the safety technology into the vehicle, looking at affordability today, and then with a -- and I would call that the evolutionary path, and then autonomous is more of the revolutionary path.

Well, the reason I asked is although fully autonomous is a noble initiative, and it's coming and to get the real, real 95% to 100% type reduction, it seems we can't -- if there are technologies that are vastly easier to implement and more affordable in an ownership model that can lead to a 50% reduction, that's not -- that's worth implementing as well. And I guess it just raises industry questions about the insurability of the vehicles that you're selling today without these systems and the value that they would have in the second hand markets. We'll continue that discussion. Maybe, Chuck, a question for you, then lastly, you mentioned the goal of a $6 billion of adjusted auto free cash flow. When I look year-to-date, though, and take the $10 billion of operating of automotive operating cash flow, and I take out CapEx, I get a number of $3.2 billion. So I guess when you say adjusted, there's some changes you're making to that number because you're not implying you're going to make almost $3 billion in the -- of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?"

And even if it's not every year, there's some regular frequency. So like last year, you made $5 of earnings, but the free cash flow per share, including the pension contributions and a lot of other unusual stuff, okay, was about $1.30. So there's a big gap. You're narrowing that gap this year. Maybe if you include the pension funding, you're getting close to half, like even narrowed it to maybe to just $6 of earnings, maybe to $3 of free cash flow a share, but you still have that gap. So the question, Chuck, is how will this gap -- will this gap be narrowed, so that your $6 or so of earnings can really reflect cash earnings as well? And what are the factors you think that can drive the narrowing of that gap?"

And for display purposes, it's on a GAAP basis, it's taking out of operating cash flow. Obviously, free cash flow would add back in because it's debt for debt. So the $5.2 billion is the right GAAP -- or the right adjusted free cash flow number and consistent with our $6 billion target free cash flow at the end of the year, and what we'll apply to our capital allocation framework. When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes, and that's going to be and has been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than DNA because we've underspent for a number of years, and it's going to take a while to catch that up, and pensions. At the end of the day, we have pension income that is noncash that gets reversed. So I would say that as we look forward, the way I think about it is our conversion ratio should improve on a go-forward basis because incremental EBIT is highly levered to cash flow on a go-forward basis, and that's what I've talked about before."

Europe, culminating in the German Bundestag sort of floating an idea of eliminating high sea sales by 2030. So I want your reaction to kind of just 3 propositions. One, do you think there's a realistic possibility that China and Europe actually get to EV penetrations mid-next decade, well ahead of the U.S.? Two, given their penchant for favoring the home team, how are you positioned, and in particular, we hear most of what you're doing were in electrification and autonomous for U.S. market, but how are you thinking about those internationally?

I would say we're also the only OEM that actually manufactures batteries in-country right now. Clearly, we have the strength of the products that we have available to sell globally with the Volt, second-generation Volt as well as the Bolt EV and the Ampera-e, along with many other electrified products in China. So we definitely see that trend. I think one of the things, though, and this is where we also have an advantage with our PATAC engineering center, that we can really leverage the supply base and the -- that volume in China to really help us globally from an electrification perspective, and we intend to do that. I would also say from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move, and we'll be announcing the Ampera-e next year that with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification. To say who's going to be -- we clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say, though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching, both cars and trucks, that are getting very good market reception. And so I think it's too soon to exactly call how the penetration is going to be, but definitely probably more significant than we thought may be 1 or 2 years. And as it relates to -- I mean, clearly, we've got to get the scale and get the engineering work done that we can have minimal impact from a margin perspective."

I would expect, and you're right, typically, depending on how the model changes are going for all of the competition, Q4 has a tendency to ramp down a little bit because you've launched the new model year vehicles for us, specifically, because we're in really good shape from that perspective, but we'd expect the industry broadly to follow that same trend.
