We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which exceeded the upper end of our financial guidance. As a result of successfully executing our strategy, the Republic team delivered higher levels of pricing, reported positive volumes, grew earnings and free cash flow, improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we made significant progress on our multi-year strategic initiatives. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the quality of our revenue, improve the customer experience and reduce costs. 
Regarding our market position. We invested $193 million in tuck-in acquisitions, nearly 2x our original goal. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue contribution of approximately $143 million at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3x. And we acquired the U.S. assets of Tervita. These assets serve as a platform acquisition in the E&P waste sector with attractive long-term fundamentals and opportunities for future growth. 
Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our capture cloud-based pricing tool and our entire sales force has been trained on priority-based selling. Our sales program is designed to identify and attract customers that are willing to pay for our higher value service offerings. 
Additionally, we now have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that use the waste-related index for annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and consistently run higher than CPI. 
Most importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these revenue-enhancing initiatives. During 2015, we reported our highest level of average yield in over 5 years. Regarding our customers. We continue to see very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. For example, approximately 1.2 million customers have enrolled in MyResource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. And we launched click to buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our residential subscription markets. Click-to-buy addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. 
Our customers see the difference in our products and services, which is reflected in our customer's satisfaction metrics. Our Net Promoter Score, which measures customers' willingness to recommend the company's products and services, improved for the third year in a row. 
And finally, regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-savings initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 72% of our residential fleet is currently automated and 78% of our total fleet has been certified under our 1 fleet maintenance program up from 60% a year ago. 
These initiatives required investment but the payback is compelling and our financial performance reflects the benefits we are seeing. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which exceeded our expectations. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.06 and adjusted free cash flow was $813 million, both exceeded the upper end of our guidance. 
Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield exceeded 2% in every quarter during 2015. Fourth quarter volumes increased 90 basis points. This is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have grown price and volumes simultaneously. 
We returned $808 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2015. This includes approximately 10 million shares repurchased for $409 million. 
We finished the year with total shareholder return of 12.4%, which includes stock appreciation of 9.3% and dividends of 3.1%. Our TSR performance exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8x. We made substantial progress in 2015 and are proud of our strong results and many accomplishments, but we have more to do. 
Last month, we entered the realignment of our organizational structure by combining 2 layers into one. This included the elimination of our 3 regions, the consolidation of 20 areas into 10 and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We are reinvesting back into our 10-area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. 
Additionally, we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into 3 customer resource centers. The state of the facilities and technology will enable better levels of customer service across several touch points, including voice, e-mail, text, social and live chat. 
The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making at our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. 
Our ability to make these organizational changes is a natural evolution and logical next step for our covenant. As a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls, we are further leveraging our scale to continually improve our service offerings. Additionally, we are able to maintain our high performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. 
We call this approach the Republic Way, which we believe is the best way to create durable operational excellence and lasting value for all our stakeholders. 
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $61 million over the prior year. This 2.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 90 basis points and acquisitions of 1.8%. 
The components of internal growth are as follows: first, average yield growth of 2.2%; average yield in the collections business was 2.7%, which includes 3.1% yield in a small container commercial business, 3.8% yield in the large container industrial business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%; core pricing, which measures price increases net of rollbacks were 3.4%; core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 90 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 90 basis points, which includes positive contribution from the large container industrial business of 2.8% and the residential business of 40 basis points. The small container commercial business was flat with the prior year. 
Our small container commercial volume includes a 40-basis-point decline from non-regrettable losses of select National Accounts and were performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.8%. Landfill increased 2.1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 5.5% and C&D of 8.2%, offset by decline in special waste volumes of 2.1%. 
The decline in special waste relates to same-store E&P volumes. Special waste volumes excluding E&P waste streams increased 1%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 170 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. 
The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.44 in the fourth quarter from $3.57 in the prior year, a decrease of 32%. The current average diesel price is $2.01 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost to our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Average commodity prices for all materials at our recycling facilities decreased 16% to an average price of $95 per ton in the fourth quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. 
Excluding the glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 14% to an average price of $108 per ton in the fourth quarter from $126 per ton in the prior year. 
We believe excluding glass and organics is a better way to report average commodity prices since they are low value wage streams and can skew the average price per ton. Our sensitivity to changing commodity prices has always excluded the impact from glass and organics. 
Again, I want to remind you that a $10 per ton move in recycling commodity prices results a $0.03 annual EPS impact. 
On our website, we posted the 3-year history of average commodity prices, including and excluding glass and organics. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 14% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 3%. Cost of goods sold for recycling commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which was down 80 basis points from the prior year. The change included a 50-basis-point increase in SG&A expenses primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and investments in initiatives. And a 30-basis-point decline in EBITDA margin from lower recycled commodity prices. 
With respect to higher SG&A costs, the increased incentive compensation expense was due to financial outperformance during 2015. I also want to remind you that we expect the cost savings from the realignment to offset the investments in initiatives beginning in Q1 2016. 
On a full year basis, EBITDA margin was 28.1%, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fuel cost and pricing in excess of cost inflation, was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of 40 basis points and lower recycling commodity prices of 40 basis points. 
When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and a sale of recycled commodity revenue. 
For example, the 2.2% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 40 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Fourth quarter 2015 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% in the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the year. 
In 2016, we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in our tax rate results in an $0.08 EPS headwind in 2016. 
Full year adjusted free cash flow was $813 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $65 million, and we expect bonus depreciation will provide a cash tax benefit of $30 million in 2016, resulting in a $35 million year-over-year cash tax headwind. 
Now, I will turn the call back to Don."

Before I open the call up for questions, I will provide our 2016 financial guidance. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.13 to $2.17, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. This continues to demonstrate the stability and predictability of our business. Our expected performance represent high single digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.08 headwind from the increase in our effective tax rate. 
We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $820 million to $840 million, which was upwardly revised from our preliminary outlook due to the extension of bonus depreciation. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit growth after excluding the change in cash taxes. 
We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3%, which includes average yield of approximately 2%. We believe this level of pricing is strong, given the 30-basis-point headwind from lower CPI-based recess. 
Volume growth in the range of 1/2 to 1%, we expect our volume trajectory to be relatively consistent with our full year 2015 performance. With the exception of residential due to noncontract losses, residential volumes are expected to be slightly negative. 
Contribution from acquisitions of 1%. This relates freely to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2015 transactions. And a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1% due to lower diesel prices. 
We anticipate an EBITDA margin of approximately 28.5%. This represents 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2015 performance. 2016 net capital expenditures are expected to be $900 million or approximately 9.5% of revenue. This level of spending includes a $60 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet as a result of our One Fleet maintenance program. This is in addition to the $40 million of capital we saved during 2015. 
We anticipate investing $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect to return approximately $820 million of total cash to shareholders through $420 million of dividends and $400 million of share repurchases. 
I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contributions that allowed us to meet our objectives and position us well for future growth. During 2016, we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, and remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.

The residential business, some of those contracts, again, have the CPI resets, which don't really work for us over the long term. We've been very good public-private partners with our residential customers and we ultimately need to have contracts that work for both parties. And so we're taking a very strong approach to trying to get these contracts switched to a new index, which we talked about successfully. And there are some contracts, frankly, that just don't work for us. And so we're going to continue to be focused on return on investments. So the residential business can be a little bit weaker in 2016 as a result of that. And again, there is how many contracts do we have and the rest of the residential contracts?"

If you look out and household formation is strong. It promises to continue to remain strong, it's steadily growing, that's good for us. The special waste business looks pretty solid, that's a good indicator of a good economy. And we've seen pretty consistent growth in even our MSW business over the last year. I mean, so I think we're in pretty good shape. We reported on the year 4-plus percent growth in MSW landfill, which that's nice to have across the business. So we'll continue to look for that. And then with the cash that's rolled to NPDES, we're being very selective about the kind of group we're getting. And as I said in my remarks, and the 11th straight quarter where we had both positive volume and pricing growth, we think that's the metric that we get both hand, and we continue to get both hands into the future and that's where we're focused.

We've got it down to 9, 8, and now 7, it's been consistently 7 for some time, driving that down to 6 will be quite a feat, but we're focused on expanding customer loyalty. And half that affection is really competitive,  the other half is what we call structural business close, and this will et cetera. 
We are really focused in on the quality of the services we're delivering to our customers, through meeting our customer commitments, which is internal metric, and then also, Net Promoter Score, which as I said in my comments, we've improved our Net Promoter Score year-over-year for 3 years. So we're very, very active in trying to understand how our customers think about this. And then we brought forward not only better quality of service delivery but a better way of doing business with us through our digital platforms. So all those things are going to include the customer experience. And on top of that, the tool set you described around PBS, capture and also frankly, the improved CRM tool there today makes them one, or more efficient, more effective, but also helps them to get basically the price for a new selling to improve. And that's what's happening with what we're seeing with price, with yield and with churn. That churn, which is essentially the difference between business gain and business lost, right, a net difference, has continued there to narrow. That's been a big part of our pricing story, and we're going to continue to focus on that as we go through the year. It's a combination of all those things and working toward, again, sending loyalty, reducing churn, which ultimately means lower defection, and creating what we call internally, willingness to pay, right? And then PBS is directing our sales teams and customers that we believe are in the segments that are more likely to buy value and less likely to be only price customers. So everything we've been talking about over the past couple years getting rolled out has been working for the greater good. And it's reflected here and our best pricing ever in 2015 or in a long time anyway. And 11 straight quarters of both price and volume growth and I said that earlier question, we're going to be focused on the right growth, right, targeted, profitable unit growth. So we're seeing it and we're seeing margin expansion, we're seeing good cash flow as a result. So that's -- as you called it, my idiosyncratic price story."

So we moved that number up 2% or 3% a year. I think last year, we converted, what, 200 or 300 routes to single operators. So that's just been ticking up. That thing will probably max out somewhere at about 80%. I'd like to think it could be a little better, but some neighborhoods and some contracts just can't quite get there. So that's just going to continue to tick up year-on-year until we are fully automated. The one fleet initiative is going to be complete this year with all of our divisions being fully trained on One Fleet and then they will be certified, some of them will be still be in the certification process into the beginning of next year. But we're seeing the benefits of the most mature sites we talked about generally accrue in the business. So the longer these divisions are on [indiscernible] the program, the better they perform. And not to mention, right, obviously, the extension of the fleet that useful life of fleet, which is a very methodical [indiscernible] of our process and as I said in our comments, we're continually taking advantage of that and as a result of that, our CapEx this year is only about 95% [ph] of revenue."

And we're not expecting the initiative comp or the incentive comp and the legal settlements to reoccur. So just from that alone, you're ending up with 100 basis points more in margin for the quarter. And we're looking at SG&A in 2016 closer to 10.5% and once again, that has to -- it's a little bit higher than the 10% that we've called out just because of some of the cost that we're occurring, associated with initiatives. But after 2018 and getting the full benefit associated with both the realignment and the customer resource centers, we're expecting SG&A to be back to around 10%. So looking longer term, really we're going to be able to start leveraging our SG&A and that's going to be a primary driver of our margins going forward."

So we are going to be as optimistic as we can be. We think the tuck-in really looks like $100 million.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which exceeded the upper end of our financial guidance. As a result of successfully executing our strategy, the Republic team delivered higher levels of pricing, reported positive volumes, grew earnings and free cash flow, improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we've made significant progress on our multiyear strategic initiatives. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the quality of our revenue, improve the customer experience and reduce costs. 
Regarding our market position. We invested $193 million in tuck-in acquisitions, nearly 2x our original goal. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue contribution of approximately $143 million at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3x. And we acquired the U.S. assets of Tervita. These assets serve as a platform acquisition in the E&P waste sector with attractive long-term fundamentals and opportunities for future growth. 
Regarding our revenue-enhancing initiatives. All of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool, and our entire sales force has been trained on Priority Based Selling. Our sales program is designed to identify and attract customers that are willing to pay for our higher-value service offerings. 
Additionally, we now have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that use a waste-related index for annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and consistently run higher than CPI. 
Most importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these revenue-enhancing initiatives. During 2015, we reported our highest level of average yield in over 5 years. 
Regarding our customers. We continue to see very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. For example, approximately 1.2 million customers have enrolled in MyResource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. And we launched click-to-buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our residential subscription markets. Click-to-buy addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. 
Our customers see the difference in our products and services, which is reflected in our customers' satisfaction metrics. Our Net Promoter Score, which measures customers' willingness to recommend the company's products and services, improved for the third year in a row. 
And finally, regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-savings initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 72% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 78% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 60% a year ago. These initiatives required investment, but the payback is compelling, and our financial performance reflects the benefits we are seeing. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which exceeded our expectations. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.06, and adjusted free cash flow was $813 million, both exceeded the upper end of our guidance.
Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield exceeded 2% in every quarter during 2015. 
Fourth quarter volumes increased 90 basis points. This is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have grown price and volumes simultaneously. 
We returned $808 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2015. This includes approximately 10 million shares repurchased for $409 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 12.4%, which includes stock appreciation of 9.3% and dividends of 3.1%. Our TSR performance exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8x. 
We made substantial progress in 2015 and are proud of our strong results and many accomplishments, but we have more to do. Last month, we announced the realignment of our organizational structure by combining 2 layers into 1. This included the elimination of our 3 regions, the consolidation of 20 areas into 10 and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We are reinvesting back into our 10-area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. 
Additionally, we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into 3 customer resource centers. The new state-of-the-art facilities and technology will enable better levels of customer service across several touch points, including voice, e-mail, text, social and live chat. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. 
Our ability to make these organizational changes is a natural evolution and logical next step for our company. As a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls, we are further leveraging our scale to continually improve our service offerings. Additionally, we are able to maintain our high-performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. We call this approach the Republic Way, which we believe is the best way to create durable operational excellence and lasting value for all our stakeholders. 
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $61 million over the prior year. This 2.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 90 basis points and acquisitions of 1.8%. 
The components of internal growth are as follows: first, average yield growth of 2.2%; average yield in the collections business was 2.7%, which includes 3.1% yield in the small-container commercial business, 3.8% yield in the large-container industrial business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. Core price, which measures price increases, net of rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 90 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 90 basis points, which includes positive contribution from the large-container industrial business of 2.8% and the residential business of 40 basis points. The small-container commercial business was flat with the prior year. 
Our small-container commercial volume includes a 40-basis-point decline from non-regrettable losses of select National Accounts and were performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.8%. Landfill increased 2.1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 5.5%; and C&D of 8.2%, offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 2.1%. The decline in special waste relates to same-store E&P volumes. Special waste volumes, excluding E&P waste streams, increased 1%. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 170 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. 
The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.44 in the fourth quarter from $3.57 in the prior year, a decrease of 32%. The current average diesel price is $2.01 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through to our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Average commodity prices for all materials at our recycling facilities decreased 16% to an average price of $95 per ton in the fourth quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 14% to an average price of $108 per ton in the fourth quarter from $126 per ton in the prior year/. We believe excluding glass and organics is a better way to report average commodity prices since they are low-value wage streams and can skew the average price per ton. Our sensitivity to changing commodity prices has always excluded the impact from glass and organics. 
Again, I want to remind you that a $10 per ton move in the recycling commodity prices results a $0.03 annual EPS impact. 
On our website, we posted the 3-year history of average commodity prices, including and excluding glass and organics. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 14% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 3%. Cost of goods sold for recycling commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which was down 80 basis points from the prior year. The change included a 50 basis point increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and investments and initiatives, and a 30 basis point decline in EBITDA margin from lower-recycle commodity prices. With respect to higher SG&A costs, the increased incentive compensation expense was due to financial outperformance during 2015. I also want to remind you that we expect the cost savings from the realignment to offset the investments and initiatives beginning in Q1 2016.
On a full year basis, EBITDA margin was 28.1%, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 90 basis points, primarily to lower fuel costs and pricing in excess of cost inflation, was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of 40 basis points and lower-recycle commodity prices of 40 basis points.  
When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees the sale of recycled-commodity revenue. For example, the 2.2% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 40 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Fourth quarter 2015 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% in the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the year. 
In 2016, we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in our tax rate results in an $0.08 EPS headwind in 2016. 
Full year adjusted free cash flow was $813 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $65 million. And we expect bonus depreciation will provide a cash tax benefit of $30 million in 2016, resulting in a $35 million year-over-year cash tax headwind. 
Now I will turn the call back to Don."

Before I open the call up for questions, I will provide our 2016 financial guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.13 to $2.17, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. This continues to demonstrate the stability and predictability of our business. Our expected performance represent high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.08 headwind from the increase in our effective tax rate. 
We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million, which was upwardly revised from our preliminary outlook due to the extension of bonus depreciation. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit growth after excluding the change in cash taxes. 
We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3%, which includes average yield of approximately 2%. We believe this level of pricing is strong, given the 30 basis point headwind from lower CPI-based resets. 
Volume growth in the range of 1.5% [ph] to 1%. We expect our volume trajectory to be relatively consistent with our full year 2015 performance with the exception of residential due to known contract losses. Residential volumes are expected to be slightly negative. 
Contribution from acquisitions of 1%. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2015 transactions and a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1% due to lower diesel prices. 
We anticipate an EBITDA margin of approximately 28.5%. This represents 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2015 performance. 
2016 net capital expenditures are expected to be $900 million or approximately 9.5% of revenue. This level of spending includes a $60 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet as a result of our One Fleet maintenance program. This is in addition to the $40 million of capital we saved during 2015. 
We anticipate investing $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect to return approximately $820 million of total cash to shareholders through $420 million of dividends and $400 million of share repurchases. 
I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contributions that allowed us to meet our objectives and position us well for future growth. During 2016, we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders and remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through a differentiation.

We've got it down to 9%, 8%, and now 7%. It's been consistently 7% for some time. Driving that down to 6% will be quite a feat, but we're focused on extending customer loyalty. Remember half of that defection is really competitive. The other half is what we call structural, business is closed, things move offshore, et cetera. We are really focused in on the quality of services we're delivering to our customers through meeting our customer commitments, which is internal metric, and then also Net Promoter Score, which what I said in my comments, we've improved our Net Promoter Score year-over-year for 3 years. So we're very, very active in trying to understand how our customers think about us. And then we brought forward not only better quality of service delivery but a better way of doing business with us through our digital platform. So all those things are driven to include -- improve the customer experience. And then on top of that, the tool set you described around PBS, Capture and also frankly the improved CRM tool that our team uses today makes them one -- or more efficient, more effective but also helps them to get basically the price for new selling to improve. And that's what's happening with what we're seeing with price, with yield and with churn. That churn, which is essentially the difference between business gain and business lost, right, the net difference, has continued there to narrow. That's been a big part of our pricing story, and we're going to continue to focus on that as we go through the year. It's a combination of all those things and working toward, again, extending the loyalty, reducing churn, which ultimately means lower defection and creating what we call internally willingness to pay, right? And then PBS is directing our sales teams. I have customers that we believe are in the segments that are more likely to buy value and less likely to be only price customers. So it's -- everything we've been talking about over the past couple of years is getting rolled out, is, we think, working for the greater good. And it's reflected here and our best pricing ever in 2015 or in a long time anyway and 11 straight quarters of both price and volume growth. And they said with an earlier question, we're going to be focused on the right growth, right, targeted, profitable unit growth. So we're seeing it, and then with the -- we're seeing margin expansion. We're seeing good cash flow as a result. So that's -- as you called it, my idiosyncratic price story."

Here's what I always say, right, in order to have a good deal, one of the main components of having a good deal is having a willing seller, right? And you need a willing seller. You need good synergy, real synergy. You'd like to get real assets and real property and real goodwill of customers. We don't buy startups. We don't buy serial sellers. We'd like good quality companies with recurring revenue and good assets. And so there's a limit to what is out there, and there's a limit, frankly, to owners who are willing to sell. And they've got to be at a point in their lives, frankly, where they are. So we are going to be as optimistic as we can be. We think the tuck-in really looks like $100 million. If something comes along that's not in our sights today, we'll let you know. As the quarters tick off, we always have the capability to do more, and that's one of the reasons that we maintain our capital structure the way that we do. And again, we're very focused on trying to grow the core, and we know the value of tucking more business into already a very strong management team and a really good, strong asset base. So if it's there, we'll take a look at it."

And so unfortunately for us, some of those contracts are still in -- with the CPI escalator. So as we're thinking about moving to new indices, that is one of the areas that we'll focus on over time.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which exceeded the upper end of our financial guidance. As a result of successfully executing our strategy, the Republic team delivered higher levels of pricing, reported positive volumes, grew earnings and free cash flow, improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we've made significant progress on our multiyear strategic initiatives. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the quality of our revenue, improve the customer experience and reduce costs. 
Regarding our market position. We invested $193 million in tuck-in acquisitions, nearly 2x our original goal. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue contribution of approximately $143 million at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3x. And we acquired the U.S. assets of Tervita. These assets serve as a platform acquisition in the E&P waste sector with attractive long-term fundamentals and opportunities for future growth. 
Regarding our revenue-enhancing initiatives. All of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool, and our entire sales force has been trained on Priority Based Selling. Our sales program is designed to identify and attract customers that are willing to pay for our higher-value service offerings. 
Additionally, we now have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that use a waste-related index for annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and consistently run higher than CPI. 
Most importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these revenue-enhancing initiatives. During 2015, we reported our highest level of average yield in over 5 years. 
Regarding our customers. We continue to see very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. For example, approximately 1.2 million customers have enrolled in MyResource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. And we launched click-to-buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our residential subscription markets. Click-to-buy addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. 
Our customers see the difference in our products and services, which is reflected in our customers' satisfaction metrics. Our Net Promoter Score, which measures customers' willingness to recommend the company's products and services, improved for the third year in a row. 
And finally, regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-savings initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 72% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 78% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 60% a year ago. These initiatives required investment, but the payback is compelling, and our financial performance reflects the benefits we are seeing. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which exceeded our expectations. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.06, and adjusted free cash flow was $813 million, both exceeded the upper end of our guidance.
Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield exceeded 2% in every quarter during 2015. 
Fourth quarter volumes increased 90 basis points. This is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have grown price and volumes simultaneously. 
We returned $808 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2015. This includes approximately 10 million shares repurchased for $409 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 12.4%, which includes stock appreciation of 9.3% and dividends of 3.1%. Our TSR performance exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8x. 
We made substantial progress in 2015 and are proud of our strong results and many accomplishments, but we have more to do. Last month, we announced the realignment of our organizational structure by combining 2 layers into 1. This included the elimination of our 3 regions, the consolidation of 20 areas into 10 and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We are reinvesting back into our 10-area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. 
Additionally, we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into 3 customer resource centers. The new state-of-the-art facilities and technology will enable better levels of customer service across several touch points, including voice, e-mail, text, social and live chat. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. 
Our ability to make these organizational changes is a natural evolution and logical next step for our company. As a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls, we are further leveraging our scale to continually improve our service offerings. Additionally, we are able to maintain our high-performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. We call this approach the Republic Way, which we believe is the best way to create durable operational excellence and lasting value for all our stakeholders. 
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $61 million over the prior year. This 2.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 90 basis points and acquisitions of 1.8%. 
The components of internal growth are as follows: first, average yield growth of 2.2%; average yield in the collections business was 2.7%, which includes 3.1% yield in the small-container commercial business, 3.8% yield in the large-container industrial business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. Core price, which measures price increases, net of rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 90 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 90 basis points, which includes positive contribution from the large-container industrial business of 2.8% and the residential business of 40 basis points. The small-container commercial business was flat with the prior year. 
Our small-container commercial volume includes a 40-basis-point decline from non-regrettable losses of select National Accounts and were [ph] performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.8%. Landfill increased 2.1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 5.5%; and C&D of 8.2%, offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 2.1%. The decline in special waste relates to same-store E&P volumes. Special waste volumes, excluding E&P waste streams, increased 1%. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 170 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. 
The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.44 in the fourth quarter from $3.57 in the prior year, a decrease of 32%. The current average diesel price is $2.01 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through to our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Average commodity prices for all materials at our recycling facilities decreased 16% to an average price of $95 per ton in the fourth quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 14% to an average price of $108 per ton in the fourth quarter from $126 per ton in the prior year. We believe excluding glass and organics is a better way to report average commodity prices since they are low-value wage streams and can skew the average price per ton. Our sensitivity to changing commodity prices has always excluded the impact from glass and organics. 
Again, I want to remind you that a $10 per ton move in the recycling commodity prices results a $0.03 annual EPS impact. 
On our website, we posted the 3-year history of average commodity prices, including and excluding glass and organics. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 14% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 3%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which was down 80 basis points from the prior year. The change included a 50 basis point increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and investments and initiatives, and a 30 basis point decline in EBITDA margin from lower-recycle commodity prices. With respect to higher SG&A costs, the increased incentive compensation expense was due to financial outperformance during 2015. I also want to remind you that we expect the cost savings from the realignment to offset the investments and initiatives beginning in Q1 2016.
On a full year basis, EBITDA margin was 28.1%, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fuel costs and pricing in excess of cost inflation, was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of 40 basis points and lower-recycle commodity prices of 40 basis points.  
When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of recycled-commodity revenue. For example, the 2.2% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 40 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Fourth quarter 2015 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% in the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the year. 
In 2016, we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in our tax rate results in an $0.08 EPS headwind in 2016. 
Full year adjusted free cash flow was $813 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $65 million. And we expect bonus depreciation will provide a cash tax benefit of $30 million in 2016, resulting in a $35 million year-over-year cash tax headwind. 
Now I will turn the call back to Don."

Before I open the call up for questions, I will provide our 2016 financial guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.13 to $2.17, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. This continues to demonstrate the stability and predictability of our business. Our expected performance represent high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.08 headwind from the increase in our effective tax rate. 
We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million, which was upwardly revised from our preliminary outlook due to the extension of bonus depreciation. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit growth after excluding the change in cash taxes. 
We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3%, which includes average yield of approximately 2%. We believe this level of pricing is strong, given the 30 basis point headwind from lower CPI-based resets. 
Volume growth in the range of 1.5% [ph] to 1%. We expect our volume trajectory to be relatively consistent with our full year 2015 performance with the exception of residential due to known contract losses. Residential volumes are expected to be slightly negative. 
Contribution from acquisitions of 1%. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2015 transactions and a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1% due to lower diesel prices. 
We anticipate an EBITDA margin of approximately 28.5%. This represents 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2015 performance. 
2016 net capital expenditures are expected to be $900 million or approximately 9.5% of revenue. This level of spending includes a $60 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet as a result of our One Fleet maintenance program. This is in addition to the $40 million of capital we saved during 2015. 
We anticipate investing $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect to return approximately $820 million of total cash to shareholders through $420 million of dividends and $400 million of share repurchases. 
I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contributions that allowed us to meet our objectives and position us well for future growth. During 2016, we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders and remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through a differentiation.

So when we talk about -- we talked about taking defection from 7%, which it's been, and I remember defection has been an all-time double digit high in the past. We've got it down to 9%, 8%, and now 7%. It's been consistently 7% for some time. Driving that down to 6% will be quite a feat, but we're focused on extending customer loyalty. Remember half of that defection is really competitive. The other half is what we call structural, business is closed, things move offshore, et cetera. We are really focused in on the quality of services we're delivering to our customers through meeting our customer commitments, which is internal metric, and then also Net Promoter Score, which what I said in my comments, we've improved our Net Promoter Score year-over-year for 3 years. So we're very, very active in trying to understand how our customers think about us. And then we brought forward not only better quality of service delivery but a better way of doing business with us through our digital platform. So all those things are driven to include -- improve the customer experience. And then on top of that, the tool set you described around PBS, Capture and also frankly the improved CRM tool that our team uses today makes them one -- or more efficient, more effective but also helps them to get basically the price for new selling to improve. And that's what's happening with what we're seeing with price, with yield and with churn. That churn, which is essentially the difference between business gain and business lost, right, the net difference, has continued to narrow. That's been a big part of our pricing story, and we're going to continue to focus on that as we go through the year. It's a combination of all those things and working toward, again, extending the loyalty, reducing churn, which ultimately means lower defection and creating what we call internally willingness to pay, right? And then PBS is directing our sales teams. I have customers that we believe are in the segments that are more likely to buy value and less likely to be only price customers. So it's -- everything we've been talking about over the past couple of years is getting rolled out, is, we think, working for the greater good. And it's reflected here and our best pricing ever in 2015 or in a long time anyway and 11 straight quarters of both price and volume growth. And they said with an earlier question, we're going to be focused on the right growth, right, targeted, profitable unit growth. So we're seeing it, and then with the -- we're seeing margin expansion. We're seeing good cash flow as a result. So that's -- as you called it, my idiosyncratic price story."

And ongoing improvements still in our product set and in our customer service offering [ph] and so on continue to drive willingness to pay.

That thing will probably max out somewhere about 80%. I'd like to think it could be a little better, but some neighborhoods and some contracts just can't quite get there. So it's going to continue to tick up year-on-year until we are fully automated. The One Fleet initiative is going to be complete this year with all of our divisions being fully trained on One Fleet, and then they will be certified. Some of them will be -- still be in the certification process into the beginning of next year. But we're seeing the benefits of the most mature sites that we talk about generally accrue in the business. So the longer these divisions are on the ones we program, the better they perform. And not to mention, right, obviously, the extension of the fleet, the useful life of fleet, which has been very methodical, well-thought-out process.

And we've also walked away from some broker relationships. Those are third parties who don't own trucks. They don't own containers. They don't own landfills. They have no risk. They bring no value to the customer. And we have had some relationships there that we've had to part ways with, and we're going to continue to be very selective of our partners.

And we're not expecting the initiative comp -- the incentive comp and the legal settlements to reoccur. So just from that alone, you're ending up with 100 basis points more in margin for the quarter. And we're looking at SG&A in 2016 closer to 10.5%. And once again, that has to -- it's a little bit higher than the 10% that we've called out just because of some of the costs that we're incurring associated with initiatives. But after 2018 and getting the full benefit associated with both the realignment and the customer resource centers, we're expecting SG&A to be back in -- back to around 10%.

You need good synergy, real synergy. You'd like to get real assets and real property and real goodwill of customers. We don't buy startups. We don't buy serial sellers. We buy good quality companies with recurring revenue and good assets. And so there's a limit to what is out there, and there's a limit, frankly, to owners who are willing to sell.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which exceeded the upper end of our financial guidance. As a result of successfully executing our strategy, the Republic team delivered higher levels of pricing, reported positive volumes, grew earnings and free cash flow, improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders. 
During 2015, we've made significant progress on our multiyear strategic initiatives. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the quality of our revenue, improve the customer experience and reduce costs. 
Regarding our market position. We invested $193 million in tuck-in acquisitions, nearly 2x our original goal. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue contribution of approximately $143 million at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3x. And we acquired the U.S. assets of Tervita. These assets serve as a platform acquisition in the E&P waste sector with attractive long-term fundamentals and opportunities for future growth. 
Regarding our revenue-enhancing initiatives. All of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool, and our entire sales force has been trained on Priority Based Selling. Our sales program is designed to identify and attract customers that are willing to pay for our higher-value service offerings. 
Additionally, we now have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that use a waste-related index for annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and consistently run higher than CPI. 
Most importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these revenue-enhancing initiatives. During 2015, we reported our highest level of average yield in over 5 years. 
Regarding our customers. We continue to see very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. For example, approximately 1.2 million customers have enrolled in MyResource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. And we launched click-to-buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our residential subscription markets. Click-to-buy addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. 
Our customers see the difference in our products and services, which is reflected in our customers' satisfaction metrics. Our Net Promoter Score, which measures customers' willingness to recommend the company's products and services, improved for the third year in a row. 
And finally, regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-savings initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 72% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 78% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 60% a year ago. These initiatives required investment, but the payback is compelling, and our financial performance reflects the benefits we are seeing. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which exceeded our expectations. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.06, and adjusted free cash flow was $813 million, both exceeded the upper end of our guidance.
Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield exceeded 2% in every quarter during 2015. 
Fourth quarter volumes increased 90 basis points. This is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have grown price and volumes simultaneously. 
We returned $808 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2015. This includes approximately 10 million shares repurchased for $409 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 12.4%, which includes stock appreciation of 9.3% and dividends of 3.1%. Our TSR performance exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8x. 
We made substantial progress in 2015 and are proud of our strong results and many accomplishments, but we have more to do. Last month, we announced the realignment of our organizational structure by combining 2 layers into 1. This included the elimination of our 3 regions, the consolidation of 20 areas into 10 and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We are reinvesting back into our 10-area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. 
Additionally, we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into 3 customer resource centers. The new state-of-the-art facilities and technology will enable better levels of customer service across several touch points, including voice, e-mail, text, social and live chat. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. 
Our ability to make these organizational changes is a natural evolution and logical next step for our company. As a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls, we are further leveraging our scale to continually improve our service offerings. Additionally, we are able to maintain our high-performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. We call this approach the Republic Way, which we believe is the best way to create durable operational excellence and lasting value for all our stakeholders. 
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $61 million over the prior year. This 2.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 90 basis points and acquisitions of 1.8%. 
The components of internal growth are as follows: first, average yield growth of 2.2%; average yield in the collections business was 2.7%, which includes 3.1% yield in the small-container commercial business, 3.8% yield in the large-container industrial business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. Core price, which measures price increases, net of rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business. 
Second, our volumes increased 90 basis points year-over-year. The collection business increased 90 basis points, which includes positive contribution from the large-container industrial business of 2.8% and the residential business of 40 basis points. The small-container commercial business was flat with the prior year. 
Our small-container commercial volume includes a 40-basis-point decline from non-regrettable losses of select National Accounts and were [ph] performed on behalf of brokers. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.8%. Landfill increased 2.1%, which includes positive MSW volumes of 5.5%; and C&D of 8.2%, offset by a decline in special waste volumes of 2.1%. The decline in special waste relates to same-store E&P volumes. Special waste volumes, excluding E&P waste streams, increased 1%. 
Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 170 basis points. The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. 
The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.44 in the fourth quarter from $3.57 in the prior year, a decrease of 32%. The current average diesel price is $2.01 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through to our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Average commodity prices for all materials at our recycling facilities decreased 16% to an average price of $95 per ton in the fourth quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 14% to an average price of $108 per ton in the fourth quarter from $126 per ton in the prior year. We believe excluding glass and organics is a better way to report average commodity prices since they are low-value wage streams and can skew the average price per ton. Our sensitivity to changing commodity prices has always excluded the impact from glass and organics. 
Again, I want to remind you that a $10 per ton move in the recycling commodity prices results a $0.03 annual EPS impact. 
On our website, we posted the 3-year history of average commodity prices, including and excluding glass and organics. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 14% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 3%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which was down 80 basis points from the prior year. The change included a 50 basis point increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and investments and initiatives, and a 30 basis point decline in EBITDA margin from lower-recycle commodity prices. With respect to higher SG&A costs, the increased incentive compensation expense was due to financial outperformance during 2015. I also want to remind you that we expect the cost savings from the realignment to offset the investments and initiatives beginning in Q1 2016.
On a full year basis, EBITDA margin was 28.1%, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion in the solid waste business of 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fuel costs and pricing in excess of cost inflation, was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of 40 basis points and lower-recycle commodity prices of 40 basis points. 
When looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of recycled-commodity revenue. For example, the 2.2% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 40 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Fourth quarter 2015 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% in the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the year. 
In 2016, we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in our tax rate results in an $0.08 EPS headwind in 2016. 
Full year adjusted free cash flow was $813 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $65 million. And we expect bonus depreciation will provide a cash tax benefit of $30 million in 2016, resulting in a $35 million year-over-year cash tax headwind. 
Now I will turn the call back to Don."

Before I open the call up for questions, I will provide our 2016 financial guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.13 to $2.17, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. This continues to demonstrate the stability and predictability of our business. Our expected performance represent high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.08 headwind from the increase in our effective tax rate. 
We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million, which was upwardly revised from our preliminary outlook due to the extension of bonus depreciation. This performance represents mid- to high single-digit growth after excluding the change in cash taxes. 
We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3%, which includes average yield of approximately 2%. We believe this level of pricing is strong, given the 30 basis point headwind from lower CPI-based resets. 
Volume growth in the range of 1.5% [ph] to 1%. We expect our volume trajectory to be relatively consistent with our full year 2015 performance with the exception of residential due to known contract losses. Residential volumes are expected to be slightly negative. 
Contribution from acquisitions of 1%. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2015 transactions and a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1% due to lower diesel prices. 
We anticipate an EBITDA margin of approximately 28.5%. This represents 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2015 performance. 
2016 net capital expenditures are expected to be $900 million or approximately 9.5% of revenue. This level of spending includes a $60 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet as a result of our One Fleet maintenance program. This is in addition to the $40 million of capital we saved during 2015. 
We anticipate investing $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect to return approximately $820 million of total cash to shareholders through $420 million of dividends and $400 million of share repurchases. 
I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contributions that allowed us to meet our objectives and position us well for future growth. During 2016, we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders and remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through a differentiation.

So when we talk about -- we talked about taking defection from 7%, which it's been, and I remember defection has been an all-time double digit high in the past. We've got it down to 9%, 8%, and now 7%. It's been consistently 7% for some time. Driving that down to 6% will be quite a feat, but we're focused on extending customer loyalty. Remember half of that defection is really competitive. The other half is what we call structural, business is closed, things move offshore, et cetera. We are really focused in on the quality of services we're delivering to our customers through meeting our customer commitments, which is internal metric, and then also Net Promoter Score, which what I said in my comments, we've improved our Net Promoter Score year-over-year for 3 years. So we're very, very active in trying to understand how our customers think about us. And then we brought forward not only better quality of service delivery but a better way of doing business with us through our digital platform. So all those things are driven to include -- improve the customer experience. And then on top of that, the tool set you described around PBS, Capture and also frankly the improved CRM tool that our team uses today makes them one -- or more efficient, more effective but also helps them to get basically the price for new selling to improve. And that's what's happening with what we're seeing with price, with yield and with churn. That churn, which is essentially the difference between business gain and business lost, right, the net difference, has continued to narrow. That's been a big part of our pricing story, and we're going to continue to focus on that as we go through the year. It's a combination of all those things and working toward, again, extending the loyalty, reducing churn, which ultimately means lower defection and creating what we call internally willingness to pay, right? And then PBS is directing our sales teams. I have customers that we believe are in the segments that are more likely to buy value and less likely to be only price customers. So it's -- everything we've been talking about over the past couple of years is getting rolled out, is, we think, working for the greater good. And it's reflected here and our best pricing ever in 2015 or in a long time anyway and 11 straight quarters of both price and volume growth. And they said with an earlier question, we're going to be focused on the right growth, right, targeted, profitable unit growth. So we're seeing it, and then with the -- we're seeing margin expansion. We're seeing good cash flow as a result. So that's -- as you called it, my idiosyncratic price story."

We would say generally flat. And we've got a couple of things going on in there. We have -- back to my comments earlier about more discipline, internal discipline on our end around price and volume, finding that right balance, really using the tools, the Capture tools, et cetera. We have talked about in previous quarters the fact that we've partnered with some nonprofitable National Accounts business, and we're going to continue to be very certain in our actions around that. And we've also walked away from some broker relationships. Those are third parties who don't own trucks. They don't own containers. They don't own landfills. They have no risk. They bring no value to the customer. And we have had some relationships there that we've had to part ways with, and we're going to continue to be very selective of our partners. And that will impact our commercial small-container growth in '16 and in '17, frankly. But we will continue to be flat at least for '16. And ultimately, as our products continue to improve and everything else, we'll get our fair share of growth. And that's the thing we always say is that 240 markets, 42 states, we're #1 or #2 market position in about 93% of those. As growth is there, we get our fair share of growth. And we want to focus that share on, again, customers who are in the right segments who value quality and are willing to pay."

We had some legal settlements of about 20 basis points, and we had some initiative investments of about 30 basis points. Now the initiative investments in 2016 are going to be offset by the cost savings from the realignment that I had talked about. And we're not expecting the initiative comp -- the incentive comp and the legal settlements to reoccur. So just from that alone, you're ending up with 100 basis points more in margin for the quarter. And we're looking at SG&A in 2016 closer to 10.5%. And once again, that has to -- it's a little bit higher than the 10% that we've called out just because of some of the costs that we're incurring associated with initiatives. But after 2018 and getting the full benefit associated with both the realignment and the customer resource centers, we're expecting SG&A to be back in -- back to around 10%. So looking longer term, really we're going to be able to start leveraging our SG&A, and that's what's going to be a primary driver of our margins going forward."

You need good synergy, real synergy. You'd like to get real assets and real property and real goodwill of customers. We don't buy startups. We don't buy serial sellers. We buy good quality companies with recurring revenue and good assets. And so there's a limit to what is out there, and there's a limit, frankly, to owners who are willing to sell. And they've got to be at a point in their lives, frankly, where they are. So we are going to be as optimistic as we can be. We think the tuck-in really looks like $100 million.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize",972,"Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value. 
During the first quarter, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.48 and adjusted free cash flow of $160 million. Both were in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.4% and average yield was 2%. This was the fifth consecutive quarter with average yield of 2% or more. Average yield was strongest in our small-container commercial and large-container industrial businesses, where a majority of the business is in the open markets. In these open markets, we have greater flexibility and can realize more pricing power from our enhanced product offering and improved service delivery, and by leveraging our priority-based selling program and our Capture pricing tool. 
First quarter volumes increased 2.5%. This included 50 basis points of contribution from 1 additional workday. Volume growth was concentrated to the event-driven waste streams, including construction and demolition and our collection and disposal business and landfill special waste. While a portion of this volume growth can be attributed to favorable weather conditions during the quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across most of our markets. Additionally, landfill MSW volumes grew 4.7%. This was the fifth straight quarter where MSW volume growth exceeded 3%. 
First quarter EBITDA margin was 27.8%. It should be noted that the additional workday resulted in a 50 basis point margin headwind, which will not repeat in future quarters. We returned $191 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.9 million shares repurchased for approximately $87 million. 
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $325 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI. Second, approximately 1.4 million customers are enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. Finally, we opened our first Customer Resource Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Center further enhances our customers' experience through more professionally trained customer service teams, improved technology and in additional communication channels. We expect to open the other 2 Customer Resource Centers later this year. 
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-saving initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 73% of our resi fleet is now currently automated and 81% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 64% a year ago. We are expediting the time line to get our entire fleet through the program by June of this year and fully certified by mid-2017. 
During the quarter, we completed the realignment of our organizational structure. This included the elimination of our regional teams, consolidation or reduction of our areas by 50% and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We reinvested a portion of the cost savings back into the remaining area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. We were able to make these changes as a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and further leveraging our scale. At the same time, we maintained our high performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and the realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. 
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I would like to provide an update on our recycling business. As many of you know, recycled commodity values have always been somewhat volatile. However, the industry has never experienced such a sustained downturn in commodity pricing. We continue to evolve our recycling strategy to adapt to this new normal. 
We are focusing on 3 key areas to evolve our business model. First, as part of our realignment, we centralized management oversight and accountability for recycling processing operations. The new organizational structure ensures clear ownership for the recycling processing market vertical and provides additional expertise and support through our recycling collection operations. 
Second, we are transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model. This model ensures that we can cover our processing cost and earn an acceptable returns on our processing investments. Under this model, we are including provisions incentivize communities to bring us high-quality materials. This includes the right to conduct waste stream audits and assess contamination fees and glass surcharges. 
And finally, we are optimizing our recycling collection business. Many municipal customers still believe there is significant value in the waste stream and are not aware of the cost to recover the material. Currently, our municipal sales team is focusing on educating municipal staff and elected officials on the all-in cost of recycling in these low commodity markets. Although we are still in the early innings, we are making progress. We transitioned our largest municipal processing agreement to a fee-based structure, negotiated a rebate production with a large customer on the East Coast and added a glass surcharge with a large customer in Texas. Our customers have told us that they value recycling and are willing to pay for these services. Our collective actions to improve the performance of our recycling business is intended to create a model for Republic and our recycling customers that ensures profitability and, therefore, supports its long-term sustainability. 
Chuck will now discuss our financial results."

First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%. The components of internal growth are",937,"Thanks, Don. First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%. The components of internal growth are as follows: first, total average yield growth of 2%, average yield in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small-container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large-container industrial business and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.5% in the open market and 1.7% in the restructured portion of our business. 
Second, our total volumes increased 2.5% year-over-year. This includes a 50 basis points of contribution from 1 additional workday. The following discussion of volume by line of business excludes the impact of the additional workday. 
The collection business increased 1.4%, which includes increases from the large-container business of 5.1% and the small-container business of 20 basis points. As expected, the residential business declined 10 basis points. 
With our large-container business, temporary C&D volumes were up 13% and recurring volumes were up 2.9%. Our small-container volume performance of 20 basis points includes a 40 basis point decline due to not renewing select National Accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. 
The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 5.5%. Landfill volume increased 6.8%, which includes MSW of 4.7%, C&D of 17.8% and special waste of 8.7%. While C&D collection volumes and landfill volumes were broad based geographically, we saw above average volume growth in the areas of the country that experienced milder winter conditions. At the same time, we saw heavy rainfall in certain areas of the country. In these areas, we experienced higher disposable expense due to heavier container weights and additional leachate management cost. We believe this additional cost were directly related to the wet weather and expect these costs will return to planned levels for the remainder of the year. 
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 140 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $23 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.08 in the first quarter from $2.92 in the prior year, a decrease of 29%. The current average diesel price is $2.20 per gallon. We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. 
Next, energy services revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in oil prices. The energy services revenue decline includes a    decrease in Tervita-related volumes from the date of acquisition and a decline in E&P volumes at our solid waste landfills. 
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 10% to $100 per ton in the first quarter from $111 per ton in the prior year. 
First quarter total recycling volume of 621,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 7% from the prior year. Volumes were approximately 1% on a same-store basis. Cost of goods sold from recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year. 
Now we'll discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 50 basis point decline from the additional workday, a 20 basis point decline from net fuel and a decline of 40 basis points from an increase in health care-related expenses. Regarding the increase in health care costs, we self-insured employee medical claims. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in large claims primarily resulting from non-work-related injuries and onetime incidents. We did not make any changes in our plan structure and our third-party administrator conference of these were not inflationary type increases. We expect health care cost to return back to planned levels for the remainder of the year. 
When looking at other cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact in the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of commodity revenue. For example, the 1.5% decline in these revenues resulted in an increase in labor expense as a percentage of revenue of 30 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. SG&A costs were 10.7% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 30 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
First quarter 2016 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the first quarter reflects a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a state tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was [ph] $160 million and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we spent $275 million or approximately 31% of our annual projected capital expenditures. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

And where I'm going with that is it would be a good thing if you got some number and then inflation comes back to 2%, and when the 2 blend together, you're net ahead of the game."

So again, with everybody listening, hopefully a lot of my teammates at Republic, right, we absolutely positively can't be entering into contracts with escalators that don't keep pace with our net inflation, inflation net of productivity. We got to be equal or better, right? And as I said many times, right, for decades, as long as I've been around, that CPI was great, it was fair, we need to get fairness again. And so, my viewpoint is all contracts have to be converted to a metric or an escalator that's fair and reasonable. So we're tackling this space. We said we got $2.5 billion of the business. About $800 million of that $2.5 billion is the smaller contracts. That's where we went to work first. Now we've got $325 million that's converted. Now we're working for bigger contracts. And we're right now, as we speak, talking to customers and very large customers about this very thing. And I think, at some point, we'll have made some of those conversions successful and the market will continue to move. So if you take a look at our pricing, this quarter, a 2% yield. We've been north of 2 now for a few quarters. What keeps holding us back down is residential. So we're very, very close to hitting this overarching metric for us of getting back to a day where yield surpasses inflation on a regular and consistent basis.  We're right on the cost of that. And so we're going to keep pushing the new metric. I don't have an exact day, date in mind where we can get there. I know we're making progress, Michael, and we're -- if you can tell the determination in my voice that we're kind of at the place where we're not taking no for an answer because we just can't be in a situation where we have these large contracts with a lot of exposure and declining returns. It's just not feasible or it's not practical."

But the other thing is that we know that while it was a mild winter, in parts of the country, it was wet, right? So we did see extra operating cost. We saw higher disposal expense where we've got predominantly third-party disposal markets, and we saw some additional leachate expenses again where it was wet. So from a weather perspective, it's not that we feel that we've got a whole lot of contribution to the bottom line from the mild winter.

We've got some landfills that have integrated water flows that we've got to deal with, so that's a little bit of a different issue. So it's really site-specific. The leachate cost that we saw in Q1 was really more about a wet, a seasonally wet and unusually, seasonally wet quarter. Having said that, landfills are more expensive to own and operate every day and every year and we're constantly evaluating our cost structure and constantly looking for ways to effectively pass along price increases into the market that makes sense to capture the cost inflation. We've got to manage the things responsibly and be good environmental stewards and we'll continue to do that.

So it's very site-specific. And again, as we have a lot of rainfall in certain parts of the country and certain parts of the year, we have snow normally. Snow tends to fall and sit on top of the landfill and then evaporate before it melts. Rainfall tends to get inside your landfill, right? So I'm not a weatherman, but that's kind of how it works, Al. So we have a number of closed landfills certainly. Some of those are so close that they're in earth, right, and there's virtually no leachate coming out of them, right? So once you complete the capital landfill and you see that completely closed state, there's no more rainwater getting into the landfill, right? So it's just about the timing, I guess, when it comes to that point. So for us, we don't have, from our perspective, as I said in an earlier question, a broad-based concern about leachate today.

But other than that, our leachate expense across the company net of those landfills is just inflating at what would be a normal inflation rate. And so we generally, to your pricing question, we generally deal with leachate expense and the cost of leachate expense through our environmental recovery fee with our landfill customers, right?

Our total C&D for the company is about 8%, and at its peak, it was 12%, okay? At its peak. So if you think about -- I always think about it this way, right? Again, back to housing starts, we said for many moons now, our business grows with population growth that drives household formation, that drives business formation. And while that household formation does create some construction degree, what we really like to see is it creates the ongoing recurring revenue part of our business, which is the small-container, large-container pickups and pools that are ongoing. That's the part of our business that's kind of our bread and butter. And we know that the construction is going to ebb and flow a little bit with the economy. Having said that, housing starts are 1.1 million. The 50-year [ph] average, if you take the peak out, it's 1.5 million. Most of the people I talked to in the housing, business are pretty bullish on housing continuing to improve. I mentioned that single-family housing is our homes arch up like 20% so -- and we know we lag sort of 1 year-plus when that's happening. So when you think about housing being strong, we feel like that's going to keep our construction business strong, not only in '16, but well into '17, through '17 frankly. So that's kind of how we look at it. And how long this is going to take to get 1.1 million to 1.5 million, I'm not sure. But we know that we get our fair share of growth is, as proven here by Q1. Again, strong temp volume, 13% in that space. So we'll continue to do with that. So we feel overall pretty positive about the macro."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize",970,"Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value. 
During the first quarter, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.48 and adjusted free cash flow of $160 million. Both were in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.4% and average yield was 2%. This was the fifth consecutive quarter with average yield of 2% or more. Average yield was strongest in our small-container commercial and large-container industrial businesses, where a majority of the business is in the open markets. In these open markets, we have greater flexibility and can realize more pricing power from our enhanced product offering and improved service delivery, and by leveraging our priority-based selling program and our Capture pricing tool.
First quarter volumes increased 2.5%. This included 50 basis points of contribution from 1 additional workday. Volume growth was concentrated to the event-driven waste streams, including construction and demolition and our collection and disposal business and landfill special waste. While a portion of this volume growth can be attributed to favorable weather conditions during the quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across most of our markets. Additionally, landfill MSW volumes grew 4.7%. This was the fifth straight quarter where MSW volume growth exceeded 3%.
First quarter EBITDA margin was 27.8%. It should be noted that the additional workday resulted in a 50 basis point margin headwind, which will not repeat in future quarters. We returned $191 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.9 million shares repurchased for approximately $87 million.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $325 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently ran higher than CPI. Second, approximately 1.4 million customers are enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. Finally, we opened our first Customer Resource Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The center further enhances our customers' experience through more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology and additional communication channels. We expect to open the other 2 Customer Resource Centers later this year.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-saving initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 73% of our resi fleet is now currently automated and 81% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 64% a year ago. We are expediting the time line to get our entire fleet through the program by June of this year and fully certified by mid-2017.
During the quarter, we completed the realignment of our organizational structure. This included the elimination of our regional teams, consolidation or reduction of our areas by 50% and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We reinvested a portion of the cost savings back into the remaining area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. We were able to make these changes as a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and further leveraging our scale. At the same time, we maintained our high performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and the realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018.
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I would like to provide an update on our recycling business. As many of you know, recycled commodity values have always been somewhat volatile. However, the industry has never experienced such a sustained downturn in commodity pricing. We continue to evolve our recycling strategy to adapt to this new normal.
We are focusing on 3 key areas to evolve our business model. First, as part of our realignment, we centralized management oversight and accountability for recycling processing operations. The new organizational structure ensures clear ownership for the recycling processing market vertical and provides additional expertise and support through our recycling collection operations. 
Second, we are transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model. This model ensures that we can cover our processing cost and earn an acceptable return on our processing investments. Under this model, we are including provisions incentivize communities to bring us high-quality materials. This includes the right to conduct waste stream audits and assess contamination fees and glass surcharges.
And finally, we are optimizing our recycling collection business. Many municipal customers still believe there is significant value in the waste stream and are not aware of the cost to recover the material. Currently, our municipal sales team is focusing on educating municipal staff and elected officials on the all-in cost of recycling in these low commodity markets. Although we are still in the early innings, we are making progress. We transitioned our largest municipal processing agreement to a fee-based structure, negotiated a rebate reduction with a large customer on the East Coast and added a glass surcharge with a large customer in Texas. Our customers have told us they value recycling and are willing to pay for these services. Our collective actions to improve the performance of our recycling business is intended to create a model for Republic and our recycling customers that ensures profitability and, therefore, supports its long-term sustainability.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results."

First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%. The components of internal growth are as follows: first, total average yield growth of 2%, average yield in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small-container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large-container industrial business and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. A majority of our third party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.5% in the open market and 1.7% in the restructured portion of our business. 
Second, our total volumes increased 2.5% year-over-year. This includes 50 basis points of contribution from 1 additional workday. The following discussion of volume by line of business excludes the impact of the additional workday. 
The collection business increased 1.4%, which includes increases from the large container business of 5.1% and the small container business of 20 basis points. As expected, the residential business declined 10 basis points.
With our large container business, temporary C&D volumes were up 13% and recurring volumes were up 2.9%. Our small-container volume performance of 20 basis points includes a 40 basis point decline due to not renewing select National Accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable.
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 5.5%. Landfill volume increased 6.8%, which includes MSW of 4.7%, C&D of 17.8% and special waste of 8.7%. While C&D collection volumes and landfill volumes were broad based geographically, we saw above average volume growth in the areas of the country that experienced milder winter conditions. At the same time, we saw heavier rainfall in certain areas of the country. In these areas, we experienced higher disposal expense due to heavier container weights and additional leachate management costs. We believe these additional costs were directly related to the wet weather and expect these costs will return to planned levels for the remainder of the year.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 140 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $23 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.08 in the first quarter from $2.92 in the prior year, a decrease of 29%. The current average diesel price is $2.20 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in oil prices. The energy services revenue decline includes a    decrease in Tervita-related volumes from the date of acquisition and a decline in E&P volumes at our solid waste landfills.
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 10% to $100 per ton in the first quarter from $111 per ton in the prior year. 
First quarter total recycling volume of 621,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 7% from the prior year. Volumes were approximately 1% on a same-store basis. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year.
Now we'll discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 50 basis point decline from the additional workday, a 20 basis point decline from net fuel and a decline of 40 basis points from an increase in health care-related expenses. Regarding the increase in health care costs, we self-insure employee medical claims. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in large claims primarily resulting from nonwork-related injuries and onetime incidents. We did not make any changes in our plan structure and our third party administrator confirmed these were not inflationary type increases. We expect health care costs to return back to planned levels for the remainder of the year. 
When looking at other cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact in the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of commodity revenue. For example, the 1.5% decline in these revenues resulted in an increase in labor expense as a percentage of revenue of 30 basis points, and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. SG&A costs were 10.7% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 30 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
First quarter 2016 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the first quarter reflects a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a state tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $160 million and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we spent $275 million or approximately 31% of our annual projected capital expenditures. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

We got to be equal or better, right? And as I've said many times, right, for decades, as long as I've been around, that CPI work great, it was fair, we need to get fairness again. And so my viewpoint is all contracts have to be converted to a metric or an escalator that's fair and reasonable. And so we're tackling this space. We said -- look, we've got $2.5 billion of the business. About $800 million of that $2.5 billion is the smaller contracts. That's where we went to work first. Now we've got $325 million that's converted. Now we're working toward bigger contracts. And we're, right now, as we speak, talking to customers, some very large customers about this very thing. And I think, at some point, we'll have made some of those conversions successful and the market will continue to move. So if you take a look at our pricing, this quarter, a 2% yield. We've been north of 2 now for a few quarters. What keeps holding that back down is residential. And so we're very, very close to hitting this overarching metric for us of getting back to a day where yield surpasses inflation on a regular and consistent basis. So we're right on the cusp of that.

I know we're making progress, Michael, and we're -- you can tell by the determination in my voice that we're kind of at a place where we're not taking no for an answer because we just can't be in a situation where we have these large contracts with a lot of exposure and declining returns.

I mean, it really is about the geology of individual landfills and also the weather that exists, whether it's a dry climate or a wet. Obviously, in the southwest, we don't have a lot of leachate. We don't have a lot of rain. We have airy climates and the water evaporates. We've got some landfills that have in gradient water flows that we've got to deal with, so that's a little bit of a different issue. So it really is site-specific. The leachate cost that we saw in Q1 was really more about a wet, a seasonally wet, an unusually, seasonally wet quarter. Having said that, landfills are more expensive to own and operate every day and every year and we're constantly evaluating our cost structure and constantly looking for ways to effectively pass along the price increases into the market that makes sense to capture the cost inflation. We've got to manage these things responsibly and be good environmental stewards and we'll continue to do that.

I mean, it's -- we talked about it being site-specific. It's really about geology and weather, right? If you have a large -- if you have a large landfill with a big open space that's not covered, right, then you get a lot of rainfall. All that rainfall goes into your landfill and becomes leachate, okay? if you are in an airy climate where you don't have leachate or don't have rainfall, you don't have that problem, right? So it's very site-specific. And again, as we have a lot of rainfall in certain parts of the country and in certain parts of the year, we have snow normally. Snow tends to fall and sit on top of the landfill and then evaporate before it melts. Rainfall tends to get inside your landfill, right? So I'm not a weatherman, but that's kind of how it works, Al. So we have a number of closed landfills certainly. Some of those are so closed that they're inert, right, and there's virtually no leachate coming out of them, right? So once you complete capped the landfill and then see that completely closed state, there's no more rainwater getting in the landfill, right? So it's just about the timing, I guess, when it comes to that point. So for us, we don't have, from our perspective, as I said in an earlier question, a broad-based concern about leachate today.

Again, back to housing starts, we've said for many moons now, our business grows with population growth that drives household formation, that drives business formation. And while that household formation creates -- this formation does create some construction debris, what we really like to see is it creates the ongoing recurring revenue part of our business, which is the small-container, large-container pickups and pools that are ongoing. That's the part of our business that's kind of our bread and butter. And we know that the construction's going to ebb and flow a little bit with the economy. Having said that, housing starts are 1.1 million. The 50-year average, if you take the peak out, it's 1.5 million. Most people I talked to that are in the housing business are pretty bullish on housing continuing to improve. I mentioned that single-family housing is -- our home starts, up like 20% so -- and we know we lag sort of 1 year-plus when that's happening. So what we think about housing being strong, we feel like that's going to keep our construction business strong, not only in '16, but well into '17, through '17 frankly. So that's kind of how we look at it. And how long this is it going to take to get from 1.1 million to 1.5 million? I'm not sure. But we know that we get our fair share of growth, as proven here by Q1. Again, a strong temp volume, 13% in that space. So we'll continue to do with that.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize",971,"Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value. 
During the first quarter, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.48 and adjusted free cash flow of $160 million. Both were in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.4% and average yield was 2%. This was the fifth consecutive quarter with average yield of 2% or more. Average yield was strongest in our small-container commercial and large-container industrial businesses, where a majority of the business is in the open markets. In these open markets, we have greater flexibility and can realize more pricing power from our enhanced product offering and improved service delivery, and by leveraging our priority-based selling program and our Capture pricing tool.
First quarter volumes increased 2.5%. This included 50 basis points of contribution from 1 additional workday. Volume growth was concentrated to the event-driven waste streams, including construction and demolition in our collection and disposal business and landfill special waste. While a portion of this volume growth can be attributed to favorable weather conditions during the quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across most of our markets. Additionally, landfill MSW volumes grew 4.7%. This was the fifth straight quarter where MSW volume growth exceeded 3%.
First quarter EBITDA margin was 27.8%. It should be noted that the additional workday resulted in a 50 basis point margin headwind, which will not repeat in future quarters. We returned $191 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.9 million shares repurchased for approximately $87 million.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $325 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently ran higher than CPI. Second, approximately 1.4 million customers are enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. Finally, we opened our first Customer Resource Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The center further enhances our customers' experience through more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology and additional communication channels. We expect to open the other 2 Customer Resource Centers later this year.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-saving initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 73% of our resi fleet is now currently automated and 81% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 64% a year ago. We are expediting the time line to get our entire fleet through the program by June of this year and fully certified by mid-2017.
During the quarter, we completed the realignment of our organizational structure. This included the elimination of our regional teams, consolidation or reduction of our areas by 50% and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We reinvested a portion of the cost savings back into the remaining area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. We were able to make these changes as a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and further leveraging our scale. At the same time, we maintained our high performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and the realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018.
Before turning the call over to Chuck, I would like to provide an update on our recycling business. As many of you know, recycled commodity values have always been somewhat volatile. However, the industry has never experienced such a sustained downturn in commodity pricing. We continue to evolve our recycling strategy to adapt to this new normal.
We are focusing on 3 key areas to evolve our business model. First, as part of our realignment, we centralized management oversight and accountability for recycling processing operations. The new organizational structure ensures clear ownership for the recycling processing market vertical and provides additional expertise and support through our recycling collection operations. 
Second, we are transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model. This model ensures that we can cover our processing cost and earn an acceptable return on our processing investments. Under this model, we are including provisions to incentivize communities to bring us high-quality materials. This includes the right to conduct waste stream audits and assess contamination fees and glass surcharges.
And finally, we are optimizing our recycling collection business. Many municipal customers still believe there is significant value in the waste stream and are not aware of the cost to recover the material. Currently, our municipal sales team is focusing on educating municipal staff and elected officials on the all-in cost of recycling in these low commodity markets. Although we are still in the early innings, we are making progress. We transitioned our largest municipal processing agreement to a fee-based structure, negotiated a rebate reduction with a large customer on the East Coast and added a glass surcharge with a large customer in Texas. Our customers have told us they value recycling and are willing to pay for these services. Our collective actions to improve the performance of our recycling business is intended to create a model for Republic and our recycling customers that ensures profitability and, therefore, supports its long-term sustainability.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results."

First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%. The components of internal growth are",938,"Thanks, Don. First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%. The components of internal growth are as follows: first, total average yield growth of 2%, average yield in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small-container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large-container industrial business and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. A majority of our third party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.5% in the open market and 1.7% in the restructured portion of our business. 
Second, our total volumes increased 2.5% year-over-year. This includes 50 basis points of contribution from 1 additional workday. The following discussion of volume by line of business excludes the impact of the additional workday. 
The collection business increased 1.4%, which includes increases from the large container business of 5.1% and the small container business of 20 basis points. As expected, the residential business declined 10 basis points.
With our large container business, temporary C&D volumes were up 13% and recurring volumes were up 2.9%. Our small-container volume performance of 20 basis points includes a 40 basis point decline due to not renewing select National Accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable.
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 5.5%. Landfill volume increased 6.8%, which includes MSW of 4.7%, C&D of 17.8% and special waste of 8.7%. While C&D collection volumes and landfill volumes were broad-based geographically, we saw above average volume growth in the areas of the country that experienced milder winter conditions. At the same time, we saw heavier rainfall in certain areas of the country. In these areas, we experienced higher disposal expense due to heavier container weights and additional leachate management costs. We believe these additional costs were directly related to the wet weather and expect these costs will return to planned levels for the remainder of the year.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 140 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $23 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.08 in the first quarter from $2.92 in the prior year, a decrease of 29%. The current average diesel price is $2.20 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in oil prices. The energy services revenue decline includes a decrease in Tervita-related volumes from the date of acquisition and a decline in E&P volumes at our solid waste landfills.
Finally, commodity revenue decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 10% to $100 per ton in the first quarter from $111 per ton in the prior year. 
First quarter total recycling volume of 621,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 7% from the prior year. Volumes were approximately 1% on a same-store basis. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year.
Now we'll discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 50 basis point decline from the additional workday, a 20 basis point decline from net fuel and a decline of 40 basis points from an increase in health care-related expenses. Regarding the increase in health care costs, we self-insure employee medical claims. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in large claims primarily resulting from nonwork-related injuries and onetime incidents. We did not make any changes in our plan structure and our third party administrator confirmed these were not inflationary type increases. We expect health care costs to return back to planned levels for the remainder of the year. 
When looking at other cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact in the decrease in fuel recovery fees in the sale of commodity revenue. For example, the 1.5% decline in these revenues resulted in an increase in labor expense as a percentage of revenue of 30 basis points, and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. SG&A costs were 10.7% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 30 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
First quarter 2016 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the first quarter reflects a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a state tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $160 million and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we spent $275 million or approximately 31% of our annual projected capital expenditures. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

So again, with everybody listening, hopefully a lot of my teammates at Republic, right, we absolutely positively can't be entering into contracts with escalators that don't keep pace with our net inflation, inflation net of productivity. We got to be equal or better, right? And as I've said many times, right, for decades, as long as I've been around, that CPI work great, it was fair, we need to get fairness again. And so my viewpoint is all contracts have to be converted to a metric or an escalator that's fair and reasonable. And so we're tackling this space. We said -- look, we've got $2.5 billion of the business. About $800 million of that $2.5 billion is the smaller contracts. That's where we went to work first. Now we've got $325 million that converted. Now we're working toward bigger contracts. And we're, right now, as we speak, talking to customers, some very large customers about this very thing. And I think, at some point, we'll have made some of those conversions successful and the market will continue to move. So if you take a look at our pricing, this quarter, a 2% yield. We've been north of 2% now for a few quarters. What keeps holding that back down is residential. And so we're very, very close to hitting this overarching metric for us of getting back to a day where yield surpasses inflation on a regular and consistent basis. We're right on the cusp of that. And so we're going to keep pushing the new metric. I don't have an exact day, date in mind when we can get there. I know we're making progress, Michael, and we're -- you can tell by the determination in my voice that we're kind of at a place where we're not taking no for an answer because we just can't be in a situation where we have these large contracts with all the exposure and declining returns.

Having said that, landfills are more expensive to own and operate every day and every year and we're constantly evaluating our cost structure and constantly looking for ways to effectively pass along the price increases into the market that makes sense to capture the cost inflation.

I mean, it's -- we talked about it being site-specific. It's really about geology and weather, right? If you have a large -- if you have a large landfill with a big open face that's not covered, right, then you get a lot of rainfall. All that rainfall goes into your landfill and becomes leachate, okay? if you are in an arid climate where you don't have leachate or don't have rainfall, you don't have that problem, right? So it's very site-specific. And again, as we have a lot of rainfall in certain parts of the country and in certain parts of the year, we have snow normally. Snow tends to fall and sit on top of the landfill and then evaporate before it melts. Rainfall tends to get inside your landfill, right? So I'm not a weatherman, but that's kind of how it works, Al. So we have a number of closed landfills certainly. Some of those are so closed that they're inert, right, and there's virtually no leachate coming out of them, right? So once you completely capped the landfill and it's in a completely closed state, there's no more rainwater getting in the landfill, right? So it's just about the timing, I guess, when it comes to that point. So for us, we don't have, from our perspective, as I said in an earlier question, a broad-based concern about leachate today. We have some specific sites that saw more leachate in the quarter because of rainfall, and we're dealing with that through normal operating expense."

Again, back to housing starts, we've said for many moons now, our business grows with population growth, that drives household formation, that drives business formation. And while that household formation creates -- this formation does create some construction debris, what we really like to see is it creates the ongoing recurring revenue part of our business, which is the small-container, large-container pickups and pools that are ongoing. That's the part of our business that's kind of our bread and butter. And we know that the construction's going to ebb and flow a little bit with the economy. Having said that, housing starts are 1.1 million. The 50-year average, if you take the peak out, it's 1.5 million. Most people I talked to that are in the housing business are pretty bullish on housing continuing to improve. I mentioned that single-family housing is -- or home starts up like 20% so -- and we know we lag sort of 1 year-plus when that's happening. So what we think about housing being strong, we feel like that's going to keep our construction business strong, not only in '16, but well into '17, through '17 frankly. So that's kind of how we look at it. And how long this is it going to take to get from 1.1 million to 1.5 million? I'm not sure. But we know that we get our fair share of growth, as proven here by Q1. Again, a strong temp volume, 13% in that space. So we'll continue to do with that.

We are pleased with our second quarter results, which are in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value. 
During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year even with a $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations. 
Core price was 3.1% and average yield was 2%. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year. We continue to see a highest level of average yield in our small-container commercial business. A majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage and increase our demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. 
Second quarter volumes grew -- increased -- second quarter volumes increased 50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter, but remained positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance. Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue from 61.5% in the prior year. There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating cost. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement cost during the quarter, which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01. We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by below CPI environment. 
We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance, which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. 
As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares of repurchase for a $194 million. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share. 
Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently ran higher than CPI. Additionally, we move $25 million in annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainly around future rate increases, and we are confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. 
Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% [ph] from the prior year. This tool significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. 
Third, our e-comm commerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our e-commerce platform. 
And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year. 
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% [ph] of our residential fleet was drilling automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 70% [ph] a year ago. We recently completed the final wave of our One Fleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017. 
Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals the impact our business, which was a premise for our 2016 business plan.

Volumes in the collection business increased 30 basis points, which included 2.9% increase from the large-container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small-container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. 
Within our large-container business, temporary C&D halls were up 6.5% and recurring halls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D halls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity. 
There was a 50 basis point impact to small-container  volume from not renewing select National Accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. 
Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year volume guidance. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased to 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6%, which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by declines and landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior year that did not repeat. 
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of. fuel. The average price we're down as diesel decreased $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%. The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. 
We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. 
Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decreased in drilling activity resulting from a decline in the price of oil. 
Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 [ph] tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus the prior year. 
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue will be below prior year levels as we exit the year. 
SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue, which represents a 30 basis point improvement from 2015. 
When looking at the detailed cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million, which included $12 million in noncash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we standard $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon. As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS. 
Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a federal tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. 
Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to $840 million. 
Now we'll turn the call back over to Don."

Obviously, a little bit of a tailwind from commodity pricing would help us also. But we are beginning to see margin expansion, right? So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter at 20 basis points as I mentioned. The other thing is we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have growth or EBITDA margin expansion during the year. Part of that is going to come from just our continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor. And also, we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday. So we feel really good about the progress that we're making this year in terms of the cost side of the equation, and we feel good about being able to get back to the 30% margins."

So let me start just by reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand, we continue to make strong investments in recycling and we are very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and to meet their sustainability goals, that only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got enough density and participation to make it work. So I see very often the sustainability doesn't work without profitability, and those are a couple of key issues. Customers really need to evaluate and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out, we've won some awards, frankly, for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling where it can't work as a loss leader. So half or are we in the process of really reinventing a reimagining recycling? It's -- again, if you think about our business being only about 10% of revenue in recycling, one of the most volatile parts of our business has been, as we just spoke to Tyler about the commodity pricing environment, while it's starting to move up a little bit, it started of very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger the second half, we'll have to see. But 2 components of recycling. One is processing, where we take in material to our facilities from third parties. And then 1 is collection. On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in for processing, we've adjusted or had to have favorable terms. So for those customers to actually share in the risk and the upside of the material in the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the process inside of our business or remaining customers are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months. So over the next 18 months, we'll negotiate to get to fair terms of there. And then on the collections side, that really besides primarily in our residential municipal business, and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we are renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts and to be longer term, so I would say we're just still very -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the dialogue has been met with the kind of practical solutions, and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership. So we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense."

The rollout of click-to-buy or e-commerce tools, right, as I said in my commentary, we're already seeing a very high percentage of new business coming through in those markets that we rolled it out.

They are shopping online and making the business the buying choice without having the interface with a live human being knocking on doors. And then secondly, those online purchases tend to be and have been at a higher-than-average price because the convenience of shopping online has value.

But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for us long as we been doing this. So the point to what is we had this low CPI environment, CPI environment for many years, we've kind of take it on the chin with certain customers, and we get to a point of renegotiation and then we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement 5 or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3 or 3 and a quarter percent price increase as we model and forth CPI. Instead, we've seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2 and a quarter. If a customer is not willing to understand that cost model and the things that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizens and a good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business. Right now, we're just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. And that's why we saw -- one of the reasons we saw a reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. So I don't want to blow that out of proportion. It's just part of the business. But it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of those successes and extending business and improving our work and our value, building stronger relationships, bring in the better service and the differentiation model that we talked about. So overall, net-net of net, directionally, the economy has been good to us, the company is growing, our people are executing. The initiatives are deployed, and we're seeing that benefit in the numbers. And the quarter is performing right in line with where we thought it would be. And we were, again, saying on top of our guidance that we expected at the upper and we continue to work just decent pricing or in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion."

We are pleased with our second quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value.
During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year even with the $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.1%, and average yield was 2%. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year.
We continue to see the highest level of average yield in our small-container commercial business. A majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage and increase and demand for service our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Second quarter volumes grew -- increased -- second quarter volumes increased 50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter, but remained positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance.
Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue from 61.5% in the prior year. There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating cost.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement cost during the quarter, which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01. We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by the low CPI environment.
We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance, which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares repurchased for $194 million. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently ran higher than CPI. Additionally, we move $25 million in annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainty around future rate increases, and we are confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. 
Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity.
Third, our e-commerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our e-commerce platform.
And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% of our residential fleet is currently automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 70% a year ago. We recently completed the final wave of our One Fleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business, which was the premise for our 2016 business plan.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"
386225,367321922,1016577,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year.

Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield growth of 2%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.3%, which includes 3.7% yield in the small-container business, 1.9% yield in the large-container business and 1.2% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. Volume growth moderated during the second quarter mostly due to the mild winter conditions, which favorably impacted our first quarter performance. Volumes in the collection business increased 30 basis points, which included 2.9% increase from the large-container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small-container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. Within our large-container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 6.5% and recurring hauls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D hauls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity.
There was a 50 basis point impact to small-container volume from not renewing select National Accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year volume guidance.
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6%, which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by a decline in landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.30 in the -- to $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%. The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in the price of oil.
Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus the prior year.
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue will be below prior year levels as we exit the year.
SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue, which represents a 30 basis point improvement from 2015.
When looking at the detailed cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we tendered $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon. As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a federal tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million, and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

As a backdrop to what Chuck said, defection has remained low at 7% and now we've had that low for a long time. Churn is improving, as Chuck said. The underlying fundamentals of small-container business are strong. So just all around good, steady business and really good execution by the sales organization.

Obviously, a little bit of a tailwind from commodity pricing would help us also. But we are beginning to see margin expansion, right? So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter, 20 basis points as I mentioned. The other thing is that we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have gross -- or EBITDA margin expansion during the year. Part of that is going to come from just our continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor. And also, we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday. So we feel really good about the progress that we're making this year in terms of the cost side of the equation, and we feel good about being able to get back to the 30% margins."

So let me start by just reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand we continue to make strong investments in recycling and we are very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and to meet their sustainability goals, that only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got enough density and participation to make it work. So I say very often that sustainability doesn't work without profitability, and those are a couple of key issues. Customers really need to evaluate, and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out, we've won some awards frankly for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling work. It can't work as a loss leader. So how far are we in the process of really reinventing, reimagining recycling? It's -- again, you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. One of the most volatile parts of our business has been, as we just spoke to Tyler about, the commodity pricing environment. While it's starting to move up a little bit, it started out very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger in the second half, we'll have to see. But 2 components of recycling: one is processing, where we take in material to our facilities from third parties; and then one is collection. On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in on processing, we've adjusted or had to have favorable terms, so where those customers actually sharing the risk and the upside of the material and the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the process inside of our business, remaining customers, are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months. So over the next 18 months, we'll negotiate to get to fairer terms there. And then on the collection side, that really resides primarily in our residential municipal business, and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we're renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts tend to be longer term, so I would say we're just still very -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the dialogue has met with kind of practical solutions, and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership. So we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense."

The rollout of click-to-buy or e-commerce tools, right, as I said in my commentary, we're already seeing a very high percentage of new business coming through in those markets that we rolled that out.

They're making the business -- the buying choice without having to interface with a live human being knocking on doors. And then secondly, those online purchases tend to be and have been at a higher-than-average price because the convenience of shopping online has value. And on top of that, those purchases have come with, frankly, a higher degree of contract compliance where customers are opting in for -- to a service agreement because of the convenience of everything. So all those things have value. And now that the tools are proven they're really user friendly and now they're rolled out almost across all of our markets, we have to just continue to push participation and the payback will be there. And frankly, if you look around at consumerism, that's where it is today.

First question just on the margins -- in the first half on EBITDA margins, first and second quarters, it was down, I think, around 40 or 50 basis points. And when you think about getting to the midpoint or the high end of your guidance, that means there's about another 120 -- 100 to 120 basis points in the second half.

But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for as long as we've been doing this. So the point to it is that we've had this low CPI environment for many years. We've kind of taken it on the chin with certain customers, and we get to a point of renegotiation. And we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement 5 or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3% or 3.25% price increase as we modeled in old CPI. Instead, we've seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2.25%. If a customer is not willing to understand that cost model and thinks that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizens and a good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business. Right now we -- just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. And that's why we saw -- one of the reasons we saw a reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. So I don't want to blow that out of proportion. It's just part of the business. But it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of those successes in extending business and improving our worth and our value, building stronger relationships, bringing the better service and the differentiation model that we talk about. So overall, net-net of net, directionally the economy has been good to us, the company is growing, our people are executing, the initiatives are deployed and we're seeing that benefits in the numbers and the quarter is performing right in line with where we thought we would be. And we're, again, saying that we're on top of our guidance and we expect to hit the upper end if we continue with just decent pricing in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion."

We are pleased with our second quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain high-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value.
During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year even with the $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.1%, and average yield was 2%. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year.
We continue to see the highest level of average yield in our small-container commercial business. A majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage an increase in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Second quarter volumes grew -- increased -- second quarter volumes increased 50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter, but remained positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance.
Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue from 61.5% in the prior year. There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating cost.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement cost during the quarter, which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01. We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by the low CPI environment.
We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance, which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares repurchased for $194 million. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives. First, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI. Additionally, we moved $25 million in annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainty around future rate increases, and we are confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. 
Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity.
Third, our e-commerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our e-commerce platform.
And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% of our residential fleet is currently automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 70% a year ago. We recently completed the final wave of our One Fleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business, which was the premise for our 2016 business plan.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year.

Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield growth of 2%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.3%, which includes 3.7% yield in the small-container business, 1.9% yield in the large-container business and 1.2% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. Volume growth moderated during the second quarter mostly due to the mild winter conditions, which favorably impacted our first quarter performance. Volumes in the collection business increased 30 basis points, which included 2.9% increase from the large-container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small-container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. Within our large-container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 6.5% and recurring hauls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D hauls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity.
There was a 50 basis point impact to small-container volume from not renewing select National Accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year volume guidance.
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6%, which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by a decline in landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.30 in the -- to $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%. The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in the price of oil.
Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to a fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus the prior year.
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue will be below prior year levels as we exit the year.
SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue, which represents a 30 basis point improvement from 2015.
When looking at the detailed cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we tendered $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon. As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a federal tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million, and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

As a backdrop to what Chuck said, defection has remained low at 7% and now we've had that low for a long time. Churn is improving, as Chuck said. The underlying fundamentals of small-container business are strong. So just all around good, steady business and really good execution by the sales organization.

So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter, 20 basis points as I mentioned. The other thing is that we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have gross -- or EBITDA margin expansion during the year. Part of that is going to come from just our continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor. And also, we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday.

So let me start by just reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand we continue to make strong investments in recycling and we are very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and meet their sustainability goals, that only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got enough density and participation to make it work. So I say very often that sustainability doesn't work without profitability, and those are a couple of key issues. Customers really need to evaluate, and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out, we've won some awards frankly for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling work. It can't work as a loss leader. So how far are we in the process of really reinventing, reimagining recycling? It's -- again, you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. One of the most volatile parts of our business has been, as we just spoke to Tyler about, the commodity pricing environment. While it's starting to move up a little bit, it started out very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger in the second half; we'll have to see. But 2 components of recycling: one is processing, where we take in material to our facilities from third parties; and then one is collection. On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in on processing, we've adjusted or had to have favorable terms, so where those customers are actually sharing the risk and the upside of the material and the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the processing of our business, the remaining customers, are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months. So over the next 18 months, we'll negotiate to get to fairer terms there. And then on the collection side, that really resides primarily in our residential municipal business, and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we're renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts tend to be longer term, so I would say we're just still very -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the dialogue has met with kind of practical solutions, and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership. So we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense."

The rollout of click-to-buy or e-commerce tools, right, as I said in my commentary, we're already seeing a very high percentage of new business coming through in those markets that we rolled that out. So the return comes from the fact that, that new business shows up with a lower cost of acquisition because basically people are self-serving, right? They're shopping online. They're making the business -- the buying choice without having to interface with a live human being knocking on doors. And then secondly, those online purchases tend to be and have been at a higher-than-average price because the convenience of shopping online has value. And on top of that, those purchases have come with, frankly, a higher degree of contract compliance where customers are opting in for -- to a service agreement because of the convenience of everything. So all those things have value. And now that the tools are proven, they're really user friendly and now they're rolled out almost across all of our markets. We have to just continue to push participation and the payback will be there. And frankly, if you look around at consumerism, that's where it is today. And we've been probably a little late to the game as an industry, but I think as an industry, we're probably ahead of many of the other people out there and certainly smaller competitors who don't have the capability or the resources to do this. And that's, of course, part of our differentiation strategy, right? We've got to meet customers where they want to be, where they want to do business. So overall, it's just one more slice of how we're going to compete in the market, how we're going to grow revenue intelligently and how we're going to do it ultimately at a lower cost to acquire."

But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for as long as we've been doing this. So the point to it is that we've had this low CPI environment for many years. We've kind of taken it on the chin with certain customers, and we get to a point of renegotiation. And we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement 5 or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3% or 3.25% price increase as we modeled in old CPI. Instead, we've seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2.25%. If a customer is not willing to understand that cost model and thinks that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizens and a good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business. Right now we are just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. And that's why we saw -- one of the reasons we saw a reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. So I don't want to blow that out of proportion. It's just part of the business. But it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of those successes in extending business and improving our worth and our value, building stronger relationships, bringing the better service and the differentiation model that we talk about. So overall, net-net of net, directionally the economy has been good to us, the company is growing, our people are executing, the initiatives are deployed and we're seeing the benefits in the numbers and the quarter is performing right in line with where we thought we would be. And we're, again, saying that we're on top of our guidance and we expect to hit the upper end if we continue with just decent pricing in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize",762,"Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain high-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value.
During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year even with the $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.1%, and average yield was 2%. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year.
We continue to see the highest level of average yield in our small-container commercial business. A majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage an increase in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Second quarter volumes grew -- increased -- second quarter volumes increased 50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter, but remained positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance.
Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue from 61.5% in the prior year. There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating cost.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement cost during the quarter, which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01. We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by the low CPI environment.
We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance, which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares repurchased for $194 million. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives. First, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI. Additionally, we moved $25 million in annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainty around future rate increases, and we are confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. 
Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity.
Third, our e-commerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our e-commerce platform.
And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% of our residential fleet is currently automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 70% a year ago. We recently completed the final wave of our One Fleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business, which was the premise for our 2016 business plan.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"
386225,367321922,1016665,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points.The components of interna",980,"Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield growth of 2%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.3%, which includes 3.7% yield in the small-container business, 1.9% yield in the large-container business and 1.2% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. Volume growth moderated during the second quarter mostly due to the mild winter conditions, which favorably impacted our first quarter performance. Volumes in the collection business increased 30 basis points, which included 2.9% increase from the large-container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small-container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. Within our large-container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 6.5% and recurring hauls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D hauls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity.
There was a 50 basis point impact to small-container volume from not renewing select National Accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year volume guidance.
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6%, which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by a decline in landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.30 in the -- to $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%. The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in the price of oil.
Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to a fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus the prior year.
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue will be below prior year levels as we exit the year.
SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue, which represents a 30 basis point improvement from 2015.
When looking at the detailed cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we tendered $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon. As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a federal tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million, and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

As a backdrop to what Chuck said, defection has remained low at 7% and now we've had that low for a long time. Churn is improving, as Chuck said. The underlying fundamentals of small-container business are strong. So just all around good, steady business and really good execution by the sales organization.

Obviously, a little bit of a tailwind from commodity pricing would help us also. But we are beginning to see margin expansion, right? So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter, 20 basis points as I mentioned. The other thing is that we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have gross -- or EBITDA margin expansion during the year. Part of that is going to come from just our continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor. And also, we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday. So we feel really good about the progress that we're making this year in terms of the cost side of the equation, and we feel good about being able to get back to those 30% margins."

So let me start by just reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand we continue to make strong investments in recycling and we are very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and meet their sustainability goals, that only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got enough density and participation to make it work. So I say very often that sustainability doesn't work without profitability, and those are a couple of key issues. Customers really need to evaluate, and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out, we've won some awards frankly for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling work. It can't work as a loss leader. So how far are we in the process of really reinventing, reimagining recycling? It's -- again, you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. One of the most volatile parts of our business has been, as we just spoke to Tyler about, the commodity pricing environment. While it's starting to move up a little bit, it started out very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger in the second half; we'll have to see. But 2 components of recycling: one is processing, where we take in material to our facilities from third parties; and then one is collection. On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in on processing, we've adjusted or had to have favorable terms, so where those customers are actually sharing the risk and the upside of the material and the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the processing side of our business, the remaining customers, are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months. So over the next 18 months, we'll negotiate to get to fairer terms there. And then on the collection side, that really resides primarily in our residential municipal business, and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we're renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts tend to be longer term, so I would say we're just still very -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the dialogue has met with kind of practical solutions, and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership. So we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense."

The rollout of click-to-buy or e-commerce tools, right, as I said in my commentary, we're already seeing a very high percentage of new business coming through in those markets that we rolled that out.

They're making the business -- the buying choice without having to interface with a live human being knocking on doors. And then secondly, those online purchases tend to be and have been at a higher-than-average price because the convenience of shopping online has value. And on top of that, those purchases have come with, frankly, a higher degree of contract compliance where customers are opting in for -- to a service agreement because of the convenience of everything. So all those things have value. And now that the tools are proven, they're really user friendly and now they're rolled out almost across all of our markets. We have to just continue to push participation and the payback will be there. And frankly, if you look around at consumerism, that's where it is today.

But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for as long as we've been doing this. So the point to it is that we've had this low CPI environment for many years. We've kind of taken it on the chin with certain customers, and we get to a point of renegotiation. And we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement 5 or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3% or 3.25% price increase as we modeled in old CPI. Instead, we've seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2.25%. If a customer is not willing to understand that cost model and thinks that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizens and a good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business. Right now we are just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. And that's why we saw -- one of the reasons we saw a reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. So I don't want to blow that out of proportion. It's just part of the business. But it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of those successes in extending business and improving our worth and our value, building stronger relationships, bringing the better service and the differentiation model that we talk about. So overall, net-net of net, directionally the economy has been good to us, the company is growing, our people are executing, the initiatives are deployed and we're seeing the benefits in the numbers and the quarter is performing right in line with where we thought we would be. And we're, again, saying that we're on top of our guidance and we expect to hit the upper end if we continue with just decent pricing in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion."

We are pleased with our second quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain high-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value.
During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year even with the $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.1%, and average yield was 2%. We expect average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year.
We continue to see the highest level of average yield in our small-container commercial business. A majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage an increase in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Second quarter volumes grew -- increased -- second quarter volumes increased 50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter, but remained positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance.
Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue from 61.5% in the prior year. There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating cost.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement cost during the quarter, which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01. We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by the low CPI environment.
We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance, which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares repurchased for $194 million. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives. First, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI. Additionally, we moved $25 million in annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainty around future rate increases, and we are confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. 
Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity.
Third, our e-commerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our e-commerce platform.
And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% of our residential fleet is currently automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 70% a year ago. We recently completed the final wave of our One Fleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business, which was the premise for our 2016 business plan.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"
386225,367321922,1017153,"Republic Services, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Republic Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year.

Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield growth of 2%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.3%, which includes 3.7% yield in the small-container business, 1.9% yield in the large-container business and 1.2% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. Volume growth moderated during the second quarter mostly due to the mild winter conditions, which favorably impacted our first quarter performance. Volumes in the collection business increased 30 basis points, which included 2.9% increase from the large-container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small-container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. Within our large-container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 6.5% and recurring hauls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D hauls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity.
There was a 50 basis point impact to small-container volume from not renewing select National Accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable. Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year volume guidance.
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6%, which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by a decline in landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.30 in the -- to $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%. The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in the price of oil.
Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to a fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus the prior year.
Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue will be below prior year levels as we exit the year.
SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue, which represents a 30 basis point improvement from 2015.
When looking at the detailed cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.
Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we tendered $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon. As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling a federal tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million, and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Now I will turn the call back over to Don."

So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter, 20 basis points as I mentioned. The other thing is that we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have gross -- or EBITDA margin expansion during the year. Part of that is going to come from just our continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor. And also, we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday.

So there's a lot of good things in the works and then again, there's always the next wave of initiatives that we haven't talked about yet."

So let me start by just reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand we continue to make strong investments in recycling and we are very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and meet their sustainability goals, that only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got enough density and participation to make it work. So I say very often that sustainability doesn't work without profitability, and those are a couple of key issues. Customers really need to evaluate, and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out, we've won some awards frankly for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling work. It can't work as a loss leader. So how far are we in the process of really reinventing, reimagining recycling? It's -- again, you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. One of the most volatile parts of our business has been, as we just spoke to Tyler about, the commodity pricing environment. While it's starting to move up a little bit, it started out very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger in the second half; we'll have to see. But 2 components of recycling: one is processing, where we take in material to our facilities from third parties; and then one is collection. On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in on processing, we've adjusted or had to have favorable terms, so where those customers are actually sharing the risk and the upside of the material and the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the processing side of our business, the remaining customers, are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months. So over the next 18 months, we'll negotiate to get to fairer terms there. And then on the collection side, that really resides primarily in our residential municipal business, and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we're renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts tend to be longer term, so I would say we're just still very -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the dialogue has met with kind of practical solutions, and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership. So we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense."

But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for as long as we've been doing this. So the point to it is that we've had this low CPI environment for many years. We've kind of taken it on the chin with certain customers, and we get to a point of renegotiation. And we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement 5 or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3% or 3.25% price increase as we modeled in old CPI. Instead, we've seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2.25%. If a customer is not willing to understand that cost model and thinks that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizens and a good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business. Right now we are just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. And that's why we saw -- one of the reasons we saw a reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. So I don't want to blow that out of proportion. It's just part of the business. But it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of those successes in extending business and improving our worth and our value, building stronger relationships, bringing the better service and the differentiation model that we talk about. So overall, net-net of net, directionally the economy has been good to us, the company is growing, our people are executing, the initiatives are deployed and we're seeing the benefits in the numbers and the quarter is performing right in line with where we thought we would be. And we're, again, saying that we're on top of our guidance and we expect to hit the upper end if we continue with just decent pricing in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion."

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. Our solid performance resulted from simultaneously growing price and volume, higher recycled commodity prices and continuing to execute our strategic initiatives. As expected, margins expanded in the third quarter keeping us well positioned to achieve our full year EBITDA margin goal. Highlights of the quarter include, adjusted EPS of $0.62, which exceeded our expectations. Our results were positively impacted by solid performance across our business and a lower tax rate. We now expect to exceed the upper end of our original guidance range.
Adjusted free cash flow was $239 million during the quarter. We now expect to meet or exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Core price was 3.2%, and average yield was 2.1%. Average yield improved sequentially even with a step down in CPI-based pricing. We continued to see relatively higher average yield in our small container commercial and large container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. We continue to see broad-based volume growth across our business, which was tempered by intentionally shedding certain volumes performed on behalf of brokers and municipal residential work that does not meet our return criteria.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. A favorable reduction in operating costs drove 20 basis points of margin expansion and lower SG&A costs resulted in 60 basis points of margin expansion. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned $622 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 6.5 million shares repurchased for $312 million. We remain on track to complete our goal of $400 million of share repurchases during 2016.
Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer facing initiatives. First, we now have approximately $375 million in annual revenue that has been converted to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or more for the annual price adjustment. Second, approximately 1.7 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 50% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. Third, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers can now purchase small container, temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. And finally, we opened our last Customer Resource Center located in Indianapolis. We continue to consolidate the customer service function from 100 different locations into 3 and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 74% of our residential fleet is currently automated and 90% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 74% a year ago. The entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
As a result of our third quarter performance and expectation that recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year financial guidance. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $2.19 to $2.20, which is an increase from our original guidance of $2.13 to $2.17.
Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be $840 million to $850 million, which is an increase from our original guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million, or 2.8% over the prior year.

Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million, or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows: first, total average yield grew 2.1% over the prior year. Average yield in the collection business was 2.6%, which includes 3.6% yield in a small container commercial business, 2.3% yield in a large container business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions.
Total price, which measures price increases less rollbacks was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.4% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 60 basis points. Volumes increased 30 basis points in a small container business, and 1% in the large container business. As expected, volumes in the residential business declined 1.1%. Volume growth in the small container business reflects a 60 basis point impact from shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have grown approximately 1%.
The decline in residential volumes resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year guidance. The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 2.5%. Landfill volumes consisted of growth in MSW of 1.9% and C&D of 13.4%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 3.6%. The decline in special waste volume relates to 2 large event driven remediation jobs in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 60 basis points. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.38 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, a decrease of 9%. The current average diesel price is $2.48 per gallon. We recovered approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 30 basis points due to a decline in drilling activity.
And finally, commodity revenue increased 70 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third parties and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 12% to $133 per ton in the third quarter from $119 per ton in the prior year. Third quarter total recycling volume of 655,000 tons was essentially flat with the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 13%, from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities.
Now we'll discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. Of the 80 basis points of margin expansion, the impact from higher recycled commodity prices contributed 10 basis points. The remaining 70 basis points of margin expansion relates to: First, a 10 basis point improvement in cost of operations resulting from price increases in excess of our cost inflations and realizing the benefit from our fleet-based initiatives; and second, a 60 basis point improvement in SG&A costs, resulting from favorably settling a legal matter, price increases in excess of our cost inflation and leveraging our fixed cost structure while growing volumes. The favorable legal settlement reduced third quarter SG&A costs by approximately 40 basis points, which more than offset legal charges recorded earlier this year.
I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost to operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-k filing. Third quarter 2016 interest expense was $89 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Both interest amounts exclude the refinancing charge.
As discussed on our second quarter call, we tendered and replaced hard coupon debt in early July. Associated with the refinancing, we incurred a $0.36 charge in the third quarter, which was recorded for loss on extinguishment of debt. The refinancing activity will save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense, or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 37%. The lower tax rate in the third quarter resulted in a $0.02 EPS benefit.
Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $239 million, and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $576 million. After considering the timing of working capital, our year-to-date performance keeps us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised full year guidance.
Now I will turn the call back to Don."

Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2017 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release.
We are currently midway through our annual punning process and based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following: adjusted earnings per share of $2.31 to $2.36, and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million to $900 million. Both performance metrics represent mid-to high single-digit growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2017.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance as result of continued focus on our strategy of profitable growth for differentiation. Together with solid operational execution, we expanded margins by simultaneously growing price and volume, reducing costs and leveraging our scale. Delivered earnings and free cash flow growth and improved return on invested capital, and increased cash returns to shareholders through a balance mix of dividends and share repurchases. Through our focus on managing the business for the long term, we continue to create lasting shareholder value.
Before going to Q&A, I would like to discuss some recent events. In September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings and was the only company in our industry included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Our customers have told us that sustainability is important to them and we believe that it drives profitability and long-term value creation. We are proud of our progress in this area and the external recognition we've received is best-in-class.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, we are happy to report that we made immediate contact with all Republic employees and all are safe. Our facilities and assets did not incur any material damage and we were fully operational in all locations within days of the hurricane. We are committed to providing the high level of service required to address the needs of our customers.
This time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

On a localized basis, you mentioned, impacted elections, yes, we do see every 4 years, when we get into this election cycle, some impacts to certain, maybe major event being pushed. But we are delayed, I think we are seeing a little bit of that in special waste right out. Roll-ups have been pretty solid for us. Me add a little lower growth in rolloff this quarter than last, but we also got higher price. So we specifically went into the market because of demand and ask for a little more price in our over temporary roll-up business. There's nothing there that has us concerned and again, just point you to next year. On the commercial side, we talked about construction coming back. That's been our leading growth headline, but we saw in Q3 the first positive or I'd say to the best positive sales growth year-over-year in our small container business in 2 years. And if you net out the losses -- the broker losses, which were intentional and not regrettable, it was a record quarter for us. and that's on top of 4 out of the past 5 quarters in that business have had 3.6% yield, too boot. So solid yield, solid growth, and again, shedding of business that's does have the right return is the right thing to do for us and working to continue to do that."

Remember, if not for the change in CPI and the fall off in recycling commodities that we saw following 2011, we be at 31% margins today. So those 2 things alone have really slowed us down, those are the big headwinds we faced. We're spending a lot of time in reimagining the recycling business. We closed facilities that don't meet the return criteria. We invested in others that do. So are still committed to recycling for customers that are willing to pay. We've continued to make good decisions there. We're converting more of our municipal business to a fair and reasonable price escalator. So those things are the continuum over the next several years, and we think we'll get back to 30%.

There are ongoing improvements in the business, all the time around productivity, around fleet. We expect our maintenance costs to moderate in Q4. We put in a lot of effort into building what I call the most reliable fleet in the industry. That's our goal. We think that reliable fleet is going to continue to help us with driving employee turnover down, employee engagement up. Tech turnover down, all of those other things, and so there's a lot of things going on in there that are worth sort of basis points at a time. The -- remember, on the CapEx side, we're going to save $200 million on a onetime CapEx savings from the One Fleet initiative and an ongoing about $20 million, $25 million a year from aging the fleet very methodically.

The couple of contracts that have been let, we weren't well positioned geographically for those and they went really cheap. Frankly, I'm disappointed to see how cheaply they went. We still think coal ash is more of an OED story and will be a big event that occurs and then it's going to be a business declined. So it's not a business that we're going to put up with a lot of effort into to be in that space long term.

We certainly are prepared to do that. We're in conversations to do that today. But over time, after all the big cleanup is completed whether people do it on their site and the building on landfills or whether we do it for them, over time, there's going to be a decreasing amount of coal ash generated in this country, based on regulation and based on the cheap cost of natural gas. So there are people who think, just a regular should change alone is going to bring coal back, but I'll tell you, with a cheap cost of natural gas, that's there's an economic decision there, right? So we just have to wait and see. And again, we don't know yet how many of these producers are going to do it themselves. We think the well-capitalized ones will. Because again, they can build it into their capital base and they can make in return on it, with the ratepayers. The smaller less well-capitalized players may not.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. Our solid performance resulted from simultaneously growing price and volume, higher recycled commodity prices and continuing to execute our strategic initiatives. 
As expected, margins expanded in the third quarter keeping us well positioned to achieve our full year EBITDA margin goal. Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS of $0.62, which exceeded our expectations. Our results were positively impacted by solid performance across our business and a lower tax rate. We now expect to exceed the upper end of our original guidance range.
Adjusted free cash flow was $239 million during the quarter. We now expect to meet or exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Core price was 3.2% and average yield was 2.1%. Average yield improved sequentially, even with a step-down in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see relatively higher average yield in our small-container commercial and large-container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. We continue to see broad-based volume growth across our business, which was tempered by intentionally shedding certain volumes performed on behalf of brokers and municipal residential work that does not meet our return criteria.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. A favorable reduction in operating cost drove 20 basis points of margin expansion, and lower SG&A costs resulted in 60 basis points of margin expansion. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned $622 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 6.5 million shares repurchased for $312 million. We remain on track to complete our goal of $400 million of share repurchases during 2016.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives. First, we now have approximately $375 million in annual revenue that has been converted to a waste-related index or fixed-rate increase of 3% or more for the annual price adjustment. Second, approximately 1.7 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 50% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. Third, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers can now purchase small-container, temporary large-container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. And finally, we opened our last Customer Resource Center located in Indianapolis. We continue to consolidate the customer service function from 100 different locations into 3 and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 74% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 90% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 74% a year ago. The entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
As a result of our third quarter performance and expectation that recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year financial guidance. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $2.19 to $2.20, which is an increase from our original guidance of $2.13 to $2.17.
Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be $840 million to $850 million, which is an increase from our original guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points.The components of internal",782,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows: First, total average yield grew 2.1% over the prior year. Average yield in the collection business was 2.6%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small-container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large-container business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions.
Total price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.4% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 60 basis points. Volumes increased 30 basis points in the small-container business and 1% in the large-container business. As expected, volumes in the residential business declined 1.1%. Volume growth in the small-container business reflects a 60 basis point impact from shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as nonregrettable. Excluding these losses, small-container volumes would have grown approximately 1%. The decline in residential volumes resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year guidance. 
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 2.5%. Landfill volumes consisted of growth in MSW of 1.9% and C&D of 13.4%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 3.6%. The decline in special waste volume relates to 2 large event-driven remediation jobs in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 60 basis points. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.38 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, a decrease of 9%. The current average diesel price is $2.48 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 30 basis points due to a decline in drilling activity.
And finally, commodity revenue increased 70 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third parties and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 12% to $133 per ton in the third quarter from $119 per ton in the prior year. Third quarter total recycling volume of 655,000 tons was essentially flat with the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 13% from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities.
Now we'll discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. Of the 80 basis points of margin expansion, the impact from higher recycled commodity prices contributed 10 basis points. The remaining 70 basis points of margin expansion relates to, first, a 10 basis point improvement in cost of operations resulting from price increases in excess of our cost inflations and realizing the benefit from our fleet-based initiatives; and second, a 60 basis point improvement in SG&A cost resulting from favorably settling a legal matter, price increases in excess of our cost inflation and leveraging our fixed-cost structure while growing volumes. The favorable legal settlement reduced third quarter SG&A costs by approximately 40 basis points, which more than offset legal charges recorded earlier this year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost to operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Third quarter 2016 interest expense was $89 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Both interest amounts exclude the refinancing charge.
As discussed on our second quarter call, we tendered and replaced higher coupon debt in early July associated with the refinancing. We incurred a $0.36 charge in the third quarter, which was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The refinancing activity will save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 37%. The lower tax rate in the third quarter resulted in a $0.02 EPS benefit.
Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $239 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $576 million. After considering the timing of working capital, our year-to-date performance keeps us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised full year guidance.

Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2017 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release.
We are currently midway through our annual planning process and, based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following: adjusted earnings per share of $2.31 to $2.36 and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million to $900 million. Both performance metrics represent mid- to high single-digit growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2017.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance as a result of continuing to focus on our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation together with solid operational execution. We expanded margins by simultaneously growing price and volume, reducing costs and leveraging our scale; delivered earnings and free cash flow growth and improved return on invested capital; and increased cash returns to shareholders through a balanced mix of dividends and share repurchases. Through our focus on managing the business for the long term, we continue to create lasting shareholder value.
Before going to Q&A, I would like to discuss some recent events. In September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings and was the only company in our industry included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Our customers have told us that sustainability is important to them, and we believe that it drives profitability and long-term value creation. We are proud of our progress in this area, and the external recognition we've received is best in class.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, we are happy to report that we made immediate contact with all Republic employees and all are safe. Our facilities and assets did not incur any material damage, and we were fully operational in all locations within days of the hurricane. We are committed to providing the high level of service required to address the needs of our customers.
At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

Let's first focus on the preliminary outlook we gave you for '17, which really says that we think the ongoing trends, underlying rational behavior in the business, underlying economy, the trajectory for the business is good into the next year. So we're not seeing anything on a real -- true trending basis that's got us concerned. We think things are going to be fine. On a localized basis, you mentioned impact of the election. Yes, we do see every 4 years, when we get into this election cycle, some impacts to certain maybe major event jobs being pushed or delayed. I think we are seeing a little bit of that in special waste right now. Roll-off's been pretty solid for us. We had a little lower growth in roll-off this quarter than last, but we also got higher price. So we specifically went into the market because of demand and asked for a little more price in our open-top temporary roll-off business. So there's nothing there that has us concerned, and again, I'd just point you to next year. And on the commercial side, and we've talked a lot about construction coming back. That's been our leading growth headline, but we saw in Q3 the first positive -- or the -- I'd say to -- the best positive sales growth year-over-year in our small-container business in 2 years. And if you net out the losses -- the broker losses, which were intentional and nonregrettable, it was a really great quarter for us. And that's on top of 4 out of the past 5 quarters in that business have had 3.6% yield, to boot. So solid yield, solid growth, and again, shedding of business that's -- that doesn't have the right return is the right thing to do for us, and we're going to continue to do that."

Remember, we know -- if not for the change in CPI and the falloff in recycling commodities that we saw following 2011, we'd be at 31% margins today. So those 2 things alone have really slowed us down. Those are the big headwinds we faced. We're spending a lot of time in reimagining the recycling business. We've closed facilities that don't meet the return criteria. We've invested in others that do. So we're still committed to recycling for customers that are willing to pay. We've continued to make good decisions there. We are converting more and more of our municipal business to a fair and reasonable price escalator. So those things are going to continue over the next several years, and we think we'll get back to 30%.

But we also said the net effect of that is not really going to be fully achieved until '18, right? So we won't see the full effect of the CRC consolidations until '18. So that's one of them. There are ongoing improvements in the business all the time around productivity, around fleet. We expect our maintenance cost to moderate in Q4. We've been putting a lot of effort into building what I call the most reliable fleet in the industry. That's our goal. We think that reliable fleet's going to continue to help us with driving employee turnover down, employee engagement up, tech turnover down, all of those other things. And so there's a lot of things going on in there that are worth sort of basis points at a time. The -- remember, on the CapEx side, we're going to save $200 million as a onetime CapEx savings from the One Fleet initiative, and an ongoing about $20 million, $25 million a year from aging the fleet very methodically. So there's no one thing, and that's the issue. There's a lot of little things we've got to do better across the whole enterprise, and I think that's what the results show."

But if you asked every one of my team members about, are we focused on 30% margin? They'll tell you, yes, we think the business can get there. And then we've got plans in place to negate some of these headwinds and overcome it. So that's what we're thinking. On coal ash, there's not a lot of activity from our perspective. The couple of contracts that have been let, we weren't well positioned geographically for those, and they went really cheap. I'm, frankly, disappointed to see how cheaply they went. We still think coal ash is more of an '18 story, and there'll be a big event that occurs, and then it's going to be a business decline. So it's not a business that we're going to put a lot of effort into to be in that space long term. But we -- where we are situated geographically to take advantage of the volume, we certainly will. We've got capacity. We're well situated around the states where the stuff is generated, and I think we'll get our fair share as long as the pricing is reasonable."

So this big cleanup that's going to occur from all the stockpile of coal ash will be an event that lasts a number of years. We will participate in that.

We can do that. We certainly are prepared to do that. We're in conversations to do that today. But over time, after all the big cleanup is completed, whether people do it on-site and they build their own landfills or whether we do it for them, over time, there's going to be a decreasing amount of coal ash generated in this country, based on regulation and based on the cheap cost of natural gas. So there are people who think just a regulation change alone is going to bring coal back. But I'll tell you, with the cheap cost of natural gas, that's -- there's an economic decision there, right? So we just have to wait and see. And again, we don't know yet how many of these producers are going to do it themselves. We think the well-capitalized ones will because, again, they can build it into their capital base and they can make a return on it with their -- with the ratepayers. The smaller, less well-capitalized players may not. But I would sit here today and tell you that many of the generators don't really have a well-thought-out plan yet.

Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation. Our solid performance resulted from simultaneously growing price and volume, higher recycled commodity prices and continuing to execute our strategic initiatives. 
As expected, margins expanded in the third quarter keeping us well positioned to achieve our full year EBITDA margin goal. Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS of $0.62, which exceeded our expectations. Our results were positively impacted by solid performance across our business and a lower tax rate. We now expect to exceed the upper end of our original guidance range.
Adjusted free cash flow was $239 million during the quarter. We now expect to meet or exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Core price was 3.2% and average yield was 2.1%. Average yield improved sequentially, even with a step-down in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see relatively higher average yield in our small-container commercial and large-container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.
Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. We continue to see broad-based volume growth across our business, which was tempered by intentionally shedding certain volumes performed on behalf of brokers and municipal residential work that does not meet our return criteria.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. A favorable reduction in operating cost drove 20 basis points of margin expansion, and lower SG&A costs resulted in 60 basis points of margin expansion. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned $622 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 6.5 million shares repurchased for $312 million. We remain on track to complete our goal of $400 million of share repurchases during 2016.
Regarding our revenue-enhancing and customer-facing initiatives. First, we now have approximately $375 million in annual revenue that has been converted to a waste-related index or fixed-rate increase of 3% or more for the annual price adjustment. Second, approximately 1.7 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 50% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. Third, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers can now purchase small-container, temporary large-container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower-cost sales channel. And finally, we opened our last Customer Resource Center located in Indianapolis. We continue to consolidate the customer service function from 100 different locations into 3 and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017.
Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 74% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 90% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 74% a year ago. The entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.
As a result of our third quarter performance and expectation that recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year financial guidance. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $2.19 to $2.20, which is an increase from our original guidance of $2.13 to $2.17.
Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be $840 million to $850 million, which is an increase from our original guidance of $820 million to $840 million.
Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?"

Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points.The components of internal",783,"Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points.
The components of internal growth are as follows: First, total average yield grew 2.1% over the prior year. Average yield in the collection business was 2.6%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small-container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large-container business and 1.5% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions.
Total price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.4% in the restricted portion of our business.
Second, our total volumes increased 60 basis points. Volumes increased 30 basis points in the small-container business and 1% in the large-container business. As expected, volumes in the residential business declined 1.1%. Volume growth in the small-container business reflects a 60 basis point impact from shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non regrettable. Excluding these losses, small-container volumes would have grown approximately 1%. The decline in residential volumes resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full year guidance. 
The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 2.5%. Landfill volumes consisted of growth in MSW of 1.9% and C&D of 13.4%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 3.6%. The decline in special waste volume relates to 2 large event-driven remediation jobs in the prior year that did not repeat.
Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 60 basis points. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.38 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, a decrease of 9%. The current average diesel price is $2.48 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.
Next, energy services revenue decreased 30 basis points due to a decline in drilling activity.
And finally, commodity revenue increased 70 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third parties and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 12% to $133 per ton in the third quarter from $119 per ton in the prior year. Third quarter total recycling volume of 655,000 tons was essentially flat with the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 13% from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities.
Now we'll discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. Of the 80 basis points of margin expansion, the impact from higher recycled commodity prices contributed 10 basis points. The remaining 70 basis points of margin expansion relates to, first, a 10 basis point improvement in cost of operations resulting from price increases in excess of our cost inflations and realizing the benefit from our fleet-based initiatives; and second, a 60 basis point improvement in SG&A cost resulting from favorably settling a legal matter, price increases in excess of our cost inflation and leveraging our fixed-cost structure while growing volumes. The favorable legal settlement reduced third quarter SG&A costs by approximately 40 basis points, which more than offset legal charges recorded earlier this year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost to operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. 
Third quarter 2016 interest expense was $89 million, which includes $12 million of noncash amortization. Both interest amounts exclude the refinancing charge.
As discussed on our second quarter call, we tendered and replaced higher coupon debt in early July associated with the refinancing. We incurred a $0.36 charge in the third quarter, which was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt. The refinancing activity will save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 37%. The lower tax rate in the third quarter resulted in a $0.02 EPS benefit.
Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $239 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $576 million. After considering the timing of working capital, our year-to-date performance keeps us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised full year guidance.
Now I will turn the call back to Don."

Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2017 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release.
We are currently midway through our annual planning process and, based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following: adjusted earnings per share of $2.31 to $2.36 and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million to $900 million. Both performance metrics represent mid- to high single-digit growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2017.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance as a result of continuing to focus on our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation together with solid operational execution. We expanded margins by simultaneously growing price and volume, reducing costs and leveraging our scale; delivered earnings and free cash flow growth and improved return on invested capital; and increased cash returns to shareholders through a balanced mix of dividends and share repurchases. Through our focus on managing the business for the long term, we continue to create lasting shareholder value.
Before going to Q&A, I would like to discuss some recent events. In September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings and was the only company in our industry included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Our customers have told us that sustainability is important to them, and we believe that it drives profitability and long-term value creation. We are proud of our progress in this area, and the external recognition we've received is best in class.
With respect to Hurricane Matthew, we are happy to report that we made immediate contact with all Republic employees and all are safe. Our facilities and assets did not incur any material damage, and we were fully operational in all locations within days of the hurricane. We are committed to providing the high level of service required to address the needs of our customers.
At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions."

Let's first focus on the preliminary outlook we gave you for '17, which really says that we think the ongoing trends, underlying rational behavior in the business, underlying economy, the trajectory for the business is good into the next year. So we're not seeing anything on a real -- true trending basis that's got us concerned. We think things are going to be fine. On a localized basis, you mentioned impact of the election. Yes, we do see every 4 years, when we get into this election cycle, some impacts to certain maybe major event jobs being pushed or delayed. I think we are seeing a little bit of that in special waste right now. Roll-off's been pretty solid for us. We had a little lower growth in roll-off this quarter than last, but we also got higher price. So we specifically went into the market because of demand and asked for a little more price in our open-top temporary roll-off business. So there's nothing there that has us concerned, and again, I'd just point you to next year. And on the commercial side, and we've talked a lot about construction coming back. That's been our leading growth headline, but we saw in Q3 the first positive -- or the -- I'd say to -- the best positive sales growth year-over-year in our small-container business in 2 years. And if you net out the losses -- the broker losses, which were intentional and non regrettable, it was a really great quarter for us. And that's on top of 4 out of the past 5 quarters in that business have had a 3.6% yield, to boot. So solid yield, solid growth, and again, shedding of business that's -- that doesn't have the right return is the right thing to do for us, and we're going to continue to do that."

Remember, we know -- if not for the change in CPI and the falloff in recycling commodities that we saw following 2011, we'd be at 31% margins today. So those 2 things alone have really slowed us down. Those are the big headwinds we faced. We're spending a lot of time in reimagining the recycling business. We've closed facilities that don't meet the return criteria. We've invested in others that do. So we're still committed to recycling for customers that are willing to pay. We've continued to make good decisions there. We are converting more and more of our municipal business to a fair and reasonable price escalator. So those things are going to continue over the next several years, and we think we'll get back to 30%. We think this business can certainly handle that, and we think the -- sort of the structural nature of the industry will allow it so."

So first, remember, when we first told you about the consolidation of the Customer Resource Centers, we were doing that, at the same time, we were going through an organizational restructuring here by combining a couple layers of management, which, that's complete. But we also said the net effect of that is not really going to be fully achieved until '18, right? So we won't see the full effect of the CRC consolidations until '18. So that's one of them. There are ongoing improvements in the business all the time around productivity, around fleet. We expect our maintenance cost to moderate in Q4. We've been putting a lot of effort into building what I call the most reliable fleet in the industry. That's our goal. We think that reliable fleet's going to continue to help us with driving employee turnover down, employee engagement up, tech turnover down, all of those other things. And so there's a lot of things going on in there that are worth sort of basis points at a time. The -- remember, on the CapEx side, we're going to save $200 million as a onetime CapEx savings from the One Fleet initiative, and an ongoing about $20 million, $25 million a year from aging the fleet very methodically. So there's no one thing, and that's the issue. There's a lot of little things we've got to do better across the whole enterprise, and I think that's what the results show."

And then the full benefit, as I said earlier, of the Customer Resource Center consolidation doesn't really hit until '18. But if you asked every one of my team members about, are we focused on 30% margin? They'll tell you, yes, we think the business can get there. And then we've got plans in place to negate some of these headwinds and overcome it. So that's what we're thinking. On coal ash, there's not a lot of activity from our perspective. The couple of contracts that have been let, we weren't well positioned geographically for those, and they went really cheap. I'm, frankly, disappointed to see how cheaply they went. We still think coal ash is more of an '18 story, and there'll be a big event that occurs, and then it's going to be a business decline. So it's not a business that we're going to put a lot of effort into to be in that space long term. But we -- where we are situated geographically to take advantage of the volume, we certainly will. We've got capacity. We're well situated around the states where the stuff is generated, and I think we'll get our fair share as long as the pricing is reasonable."

So this big cleanup that's going to occur from all the stockpile of coal ash will be an event that lasts a number of years. We will participate in that. Again, remember, big generators are going to want to build monofills. So you're going to have to be -- make a big dedicated play to give up a portion of your landfill to handle their needs. We can do that. We certainly are prepared to do that. We're in conversations to do that today. But over time, after all the big cleanup is completed, whether people do it on-site and they build their own landfills or whether we do it for them, over time, there's going to be a decreasing amount of coal ash generated in this country, based on regulation and based on the cheap cost of natural gas. So there are people who think just a regulation change alone is going to bring coal back. But I'll tell you, with the cheap cost of natural gas, that's -- there's an economic decision there, right? So we just have to wait and see. And again, we don't know yet how many of these producers are going to do it themselves. We think the well-capitalized ones will because, again, they can build it into their capital base and they can make a return on it with their -- with the ratepayers. The smaller, less well-capitalized players may not. But I would sit here today and tell you that many of the generators don't really have a well-thought-out plan yet. And remember, only one state so far has come out with rules. And while the Feds have passed the rules, only one state has passed rules. So the reigning states have not yet. So it's just still early.
