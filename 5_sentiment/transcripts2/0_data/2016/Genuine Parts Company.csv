And once we've completed our individual comments, we look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. 
Earlier this morning we released our fourth quarter and year-end results, and hopefully, you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,682,000,000, which was down 4% with negative currency impact accounting for 3% of this decrease. Net income was $161.3 million, which was down 3%. Earnings per share were $1.07 this year, which was even with last year, and currency negatively impacted the EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. For the full year, sales were $15,280,000,000, which was down 0.4% with currency costing us 3 points of revenue growth. Net income was $706 million, which was down just under 1% and earnings per share were $4.63 this year compared to $4.61 in 2014, and for the full year, the currency impact was $0.14. 
After several years of solid performances, 2015 proved to be a more challenging year for us, largely attributable to the combination of the significant slowdown experienced in our Industrial and Electrical businesses and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange, primarily on our Automotive business. Fortunately, as you will hear from Paul in a few minutes, the underlying fundamentals remain positive for the Automotive segment, and each of our automotive businesses are turning in solid local currency results. 
The Industrial operations, our second largest business segment representing 30% of total company sales in this past year, and they ended the year down 3%. And as we reported over the course of the year, we saw sequential revenue deceleration as the year progressed. After being up 3% in the first quarter, the Industrial operations were down 2% in Q2, down 4% in Q3 and down 8% in the fourth quarter, and these results are reflective of the sluggish end market conditions encountered by many of our Industrial customers. Customers in the oil and gas original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental were all down double digits with us for the year. And as a point of information, the fourth quarter decreases were even more significant than the full year declines, indicating the ongoing challenges faced by customers in each of these segments. Conversely, customers in aggregate and cement, food products, automotive lumber and wood products all generated positive results for us this past year. And in looking ahead, we would expect positive results from each of these customer categories in 2016 as well. 
At the same time, however, our expectation is for continued declines from customers in the oil and gas original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental categories for several more quarters, which will certainly be a headwind to our overall sales results. In an effort to offset this, our Industrial team remains focused on key elements of their sales strategy including share of wallet initiatives with existing customers, expansion of our customer base, product line extensions and expanding our geographic footprint and product capabilities through acquisitions. And on this last point, we're pleased to report 2 acquisitions that are scheduled to close on March 1 with combined revenue of approximately $50 million in both companies nicely complement Motion's existing business and it will help our growth rates over the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to our Electrical segment, EIS ended the year with sales of $751 million, which was up 2% and represents 5% of total company revenues. As with Motion, EIS had mixed results among those segments. Customers in the wire and cable and fabrication sides of the business generated nice increases while customers in the electrical side had decreases. The Electrical segment represents about 40% of EIS' total revenue, and similar to Motion, we're probably a few quarters away from seeing stabilization in this segment. In the meantime, they're employing many of the same growth strategies as Motion including acquisitions, and our expectation is to be in a position to announce a $50 million plus acquisition in the weeks ahead, which will certainly have a nice positive impact on the EIS results in 2016. 
And a few comments on our Office Products group, which represents 13% of total company sales in 2015. They ended the year with sales of just over $1.9 billion and this was up 7.5%. The Office Products growth was fueled by incremental acquisition revenue and strong double-digit growth from the Mega Channel. Our independent reseller business was down low single digits for the year with most of this decrease coming in the second half of the year. On the product side, we had double-digit growth for the year in furniture and facility and breakroom supplies and mid-single-digit growth in our core Office Products supplies, and we are pleased with the progress made in each of these categories. Technology products were flat for the year. And looking at Office Products results over the course of the year, it was a really tale of 2 halves, with first half revenues being up 16% and second half revenue being up just slightly. The upsized first half increases were driven by the aforementioned incremental acquisition volume and increased revenue from the Mega Channel that was anniversaried early in Q3. And then we feel our second half results are more reflective of the ongoing underlying sluggish conditions in the Office Products industry. Many of the ongoing issues within the industry are secular in nature, and as a result, our team continues to work on market share and share of wallet initiatives, product line additions and extensions, product and channel diversification as well as strategic acquisitions. You will recall that we completed the acquisition of Malt Industries late in 2015. Malt is a distributor of safety suppliers and protective apparel with annual sales of about $20 million. We are pleased with their progress to date. This acquisition helped to further diversify our product and channel portfolios, and we will pursue additional acquisition opportunities to continue this strategy in the quarters ahead. 
So that's a quick overview of the non-automotive segment, and Paul will now give you an update on the Automotive results. Paul?"

Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and I have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter endin",1585,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and I have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. 
For the quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were down 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 2.5% in core Automotive growth and a slight benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the impact of currency we saw throughout 2015. Our U.S. team posted a 2% sales increase in the fourth quarter compared with 3% growth experienced through the first 9 months of 2015. Our international businesses, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, we remain encouraged by the steady and consistent growth we are experiencing across all of our international markets. We see no reason for this not to continue in 2016. 
In the U.S., our results vary by geographical region. Our business in the North East, Florida, Central and Western regions of the country continue to deliver solid results. The Midwest, mountain and Southwest regions of this country all came in below our expectations. Given our strong commercial presence with fleets including many in the battered oil and gas sector, we felt the effect across many of our stores throughout the mountain and Southwest regions. Particularly hard-hit were stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana and the Dakotas. We also are seeing the effects across many of our stores in Western Canada. We would also add the above average temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter across the Midwest and Mountain regions negatively impacted our winter good sales. 
SO now let's turn to our same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew comp store sales in the fourth quarter by 2%. This compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through 9 months. Cadence at the quarter, our team posted solid results in both October and December. In fact, we are encouraged as we entered the fourth quarter as October same-store sales were our second-best results of the year. The month of November proved to be the outlier and we believe warmer-than-normal temps in the month caused this downturn. This quarter's 2% increase is on top of the 7% increase generated in the fourth quarter of 2014, giving us a 2-year stack of 9%. This increase was driven by a combination of gains on both our commercial side of our business as well as by our retail business. 
So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in our Q3 call, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. These initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended initial store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. And while we are in the early days of rolling out these initiatives, we are pleased with the initial results. Our plans call for us to expand our 20-store impact pilot 2016 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results, and for the fourth quarter, we can report a total increase of 5% in our retail business. Coupling this 5% increase was the 11% increase we posted in Q4 of 2014, gives us a 2-year stack of 16%. For the full year, our retail business was up 6%. These gains are being driven by both transaction and basket size increases. In Q4, we experienced a mid-single-digit increase in our average retail ticket and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted 2% increase in the fourth quarter and a 2-year stack of 8%. So for the year, we can report a 3% increase in our commercial business. The core elements of this segment continue to center around our Major Accounts business and our NAPA AutoCare business. In 2015, we expanded our AutoCare membership count, which now totals 16,300-plus across the U.S. Both our AutoCare and Major Account business has generated mid-single-digit growth for the year. We believe the slowdown in the Industrial sector had a material impact on our fleet business in the quarter. This business was up just 1% after delivering 3-plus percent increases in the previous 3 quarters. Our Q4 2-year stack in our fleet business now stands at 6%. 
Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digits, with little or no benefit from installation while we saw a slight decline in the number of tickets moving to our stores. 
So now let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the quarter and it has been a strong category for us all year. The brakes category grew low double digits for us in the fourth quarter and we also saw experienced -- we also experienced solid growth in our tool and equipment business. An area of concern would be in our battery business, which was off slightly in the quarter. We believe this was attributable to the warmer winter temperatures. And we can report this business has now bounced back in the month of January and our team drove a double-digit increase in the month of January. We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. This business was up high single digits in the quarter and posted double-digit growth for the year. On February 1, we announced the acquisition of Olympus Import Parts. Olympus is a 30-year business specialized in professional grade import auto parts. They currently operate out of 6 locations in the Northern Virginia and greater D.C. area generate approximately $25 million in annualized revenue. This business will be a nice complement to our growing NAPA import business as well as our [indiscernible] Import Parts business. We'd like to extend warm welcome to Mike Brown and the entire Olympus team to Genuine Parts Company. 
We'd also like to provide you with an update on the previously discussed acquisition target. During our third quarter call, we reviewed with you the pending acquisition of Covs Parts, a 25-branch distribution company based in Western Australia. While we had hoped to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, we encountered regulatory approval delays, moving the expected close of this transaction to no later than April 1 of this year. With approval for 21 branches the addition of Covs Parts further expands our market presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million. This acquisition will expand our industry-leading presence in Australia and New Zealand and puts us over the 500-store mark. We are proud of our team in Asia Pacific and look forward to another solid year from this business in 2016. As we look to the immediate future, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive businesses both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of fleet remains an excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to pose substantial gain. Miles driven actually increased 3.5% through the first 11 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is November, which was up 4.3% year-over-year, also a new record. This now makes 21 consecutive months of increases in miles driven and it certainly is driving -- these key metrics are driven by lower fuel costs. 
The natural -- the national average price of gas in 2015 was $2.40 per gallon, which was the second lowest annual average in the past 10 years. Gas prices continue to move downward, and in most parts of the U.S. today, the average is less than $2 a gallon. These low gas prices should bode well for future increases in both miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we are pleased to show positive underlying Automotive growth for both the quarter and year in a challenging economic environment, and we are encouraged with the start to the New Year as our sales in January were more in line with our historical run rates. We remain hopeful we can carry this momentum through the end of the quarter and the balance of 2016. 
As we move into 2016, our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. Want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. 
And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with the review of our financial results. Carol?"
275034,322612288,933773,"Genuine Parts Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and the segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues o",2241,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and the segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter were down 4% and consists of a decrease of underlying sales of 2%, a currency headwind of 3% and acquisitions contributed 1%. For the year, total revenues of $15.3 billion consisted of core sales growth of 1.5% and a 1% contribution from acquisitions offset by a 3% currency headwind. 
Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 29.75, down from 30.0 gross margin last year. And for the year gross margin of 29.8 compares to 29.9 reported last year. Primarily, our gross margins for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from improved margins in our Automotive, office and Electrical businesses but our growth in these segments was offset by the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. This directly related to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases for this group. We recognize the need for additional progress on this line and the importance of executing on our gross margin initiatives. This is a key priority for our management team, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
Our gross margin initiatives are critical to offset the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now especially in Automotive. Our cumulative supplier price changes in 2015 were negative 20 basis points, or 0.2% for Automotive, positive 90 basis points for Industrial, positive 60 basis points for Office Products and negative 1.75% for Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $834 million or 22.65% of sales, which is a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year. For the full year, our total expenses of $3.4 billion at 22.46% of sales are a 20 basis point improvement. The improvement in our SG&A expenses reflects the positive impact of our cost control measures across all of our businesses. Additionally, we had added savings of lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter relative to 2014. Overall, our cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by the deleveraging of expenses in our Industrial business as well as the increases in expenses across the company in areas such as employee benefits and retirement plans and health care. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations. We expect to show continued progress on this line in the periods ahead. 
If we look at our results for the segments, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $169 million is up 12.5% and their margin improved a strong 110 basis points due to the improved gross margins and expense controls. For the year, Automotive sales of $8 billion are down 1%. Our operating profit of $729 million is up 4% and our margin has improved by 40 basis points to 9.1%, so a solid margin expansion for Automotive in 2015. Our Industrial sales of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8%. Our operating profit is $72 million is down 24.8% and our operating margin was down 150 basis points to 6.5%. For the year, Industrial sales of $4.6 billion are down 2.6% from the prior year and our operating profit of $339 million is down 8.3% and our margin was 7.3%, which is down 50 basis points from last year. This is driven by lower incentive and expense deleverage which pressured this group throughout the year but at a greater amount in the fourth quarter. Our 
Office Products revenues were $459 million in the quarter, down 2%. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and their operating margin of 7.3% is down 20 basis points. For the year, office revenues of $1.9 billion are up 7.5% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $141 million is up 5% and our margin of 7.3% is down 10 basis points from last year. 
The Electrical group had sales in the quarter of $177 million, which is basically flat with the prior year. Our operating profit of $16 [ph] million is up 6.7%, so the margin for this group showed strong growth as 60 basis points to 9.1%. For the year, sales for this group of $751 million are up 1.6% and their operating profit of $70 million is up 9% and their margin improved to 9.3%, which is a solid 50 basis point increase from the prior year. 
For both the fourth quarter and the full year, our total operating margin improved by 10 basis points. For the quarter, the margin was 7.9% compared to 7.8% and, for the year, 8.4% compared to 8.3%. This improvement in 2015 follows our 30 basis point expansion in 2014. And given this current sales environment, we're very pleased with our continued progress in this area. Looking ahead, further margin expansion remains a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.3 million in the quarter, and for the 12 months, interest expense was $20.4 million, which compares to $24.2 million in 2014. For 2016, we currently estimate net interest expense to approximate $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $9 million for the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year is down slightly from 2014. We currently estimate total amortization expense of $36 million to $38 million for the full year in 2016. Our depreciation of $27 million for the fourth quarter and $107 million for the full year, and for 2016, we are projecting this to be approximately $120 million to $130 million. So combined, depreciation and amortization looking ahead would be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $16.3 million for the quarter, which is up slightly from the prior year quarter. For the full year, our corporate expense is $100.4 million, which is consistent with our expectations and up from the $90 million in the prior year. Primarily, unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $7 million and planned IT-related investments accounted for the increase on this line. 
Turning to 2016, we expect the corporate expense line to be in the $110 million to $120 million range for the full year. Our tax rate was 38.35% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in mix of our foreign income and the related foreign tax rates as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustment recorded through the first 9 months of 2015. We currently expect our tax rate to approximate 37% for the full year in 2016. Our net income for the quarter of $161.3 million and our EPS of $1.07 was equal to the prior year. And for the year, our EPS of $4.63 was up slightly from the $4.61 from last year. 
Now let's talk about the balance sheet, which we strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at December was $212 million, which is an increase from $138 million at December 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support our growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at December 31 is down 3% from the prior year on a 4% decrease in sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2016. 
Accounts payable at December 31 was $2.8 billion, up 10%, and this is due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area and we're encouraged by its positive impact on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at December 31 has significantly improved from the prior year in both absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues. We're progress in this area contributed significantly to our record cash flows for the year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt at $625 million at December 31 is down approximately $140 million from the $765 million in the prior year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $125 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. Our debt to capitalization at 16.5% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that provides our company with both the financial capacity and the flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated record cash flows in 2015 driven in part by our improvement in working capital. Cash from operations was $1.2 billion and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, was $682 million. This is a meaningful accomplishment for us, and for 2016, we're currently planning for another strong year of cash flows. We would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. 
Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to the growth plans of our company. In 2015, we made a number strategic acquisitions to expand our distribution footprint, and in total, these new businesses are expected to contribute $180 million in annual revenues. Thus far, in 2016, we've added the Olympus Import Parts distribution business, as covered by Paul, and looking forward in 2016, we will continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are still open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes large and small assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to our share repurchases in 2015, we used our cash to repurchase 3.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Through today, we have also purchased another 570,000 shares of stock, and today, we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we have been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our stock price over the last 12 to 14 months. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $48 million for the fourth quarter, which is an increase from that $34 million in the prior year. For the year, our capital spending was $110 million, up slightly from the prior year. We are currently planning for capital expenditures to increase further in 2016 to approximately $140 million to $160 million with the vast majority of our investments weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects primarily in technology. 
Effective yesterday, the board approval $2.63 per share annual dividend for 2016, marking our 60th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share and it's approximately 57% of our prior year earnings. This is slightly above our stated goal of a payout ratio of 50% to 55% but we're comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year. And in summary, we operated in 2015 with relatively mixed results. That said, we improved the strength of our balance sheet with excellent working capital management and effective cost control measures helped us produce an expanded operating profit margin. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and a record earnings per share for 2015. These are meaningful accomplishments, and our progress in the areas supports our investment in growth opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders with the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the periods ahead, and I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and their commitment to their jobs. 
Now I'll turn it now back over to Tom."

And in closing, we would say, as mentioned earlier, that it was a challenging year in many ways but a gratifying year in other ways. Our revenue production and local currencies were solid across our Automotive businesses as it was in Office Products, but Industrial and Electrical found it more difficult. We were pleased to see strong operating margin movements in Automotive and Electrical, but we had operating margin declines in Office Products and Industrial. We were, however, to show a 10 basis point improvement for GPC overall despite the Office Products and Industrial challenges. 
Gross profit was down 12 basis points for the year but good work was done on the SG&A side and SG&A was down 20 basis points. As a result, pretax income was up slightly, but due to the higher tax rate that Carol explained, net income was down slightly. On the balance sheet side, the progress was more consistent with cash from operations and free cash flow setting new records, and working capital was reduced once again in 2015. And we returned well over $600 million back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and we reinvested over $225 million back into the business through a combination of capital expenditures and acquisitions. And we expect to invest an additional $125 million in acquisitions over the next few months. And these CapEx and acquisition investments are intended to provide revenue and profit growth in the quarters ahead. 
Now turning to the year ahead. As a general statement, we would say that we remain quite cautious in our outlook. The general economic conditions look a bit fragile and perhaps tenuous both domestically and globally. And as mentioned earlier, this was already having a significant impact on certain segments of our customer base, primarily in Industrial and Electrical. Conversely, we think that the outlook for our Automotive segment is generally favorable but the currency impact will once again be a headwind to our Automotive growth in 2015. With all of that said, at this point, we would expect our 2016 revenues to be up 2% to 3% in Automotive with the currency headwind up 3%; Industrial, up 1% to 2%; Electrical, up 1% to 2%; Office Products, down 1% up to 1%, giving us a total GPC revenue expectation of being up 1% to 2% and up 3% to 4% before the currency impact. And with revenue growth at these levels, we would suggest an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.80, which will be up 1.5% to 3.5% after currency exchange impact of approximately $0.08 per share, and before the currency exchange impact, we'd be up 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Chris."

And once we've completed our individual comments, we look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. 
Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results, and hopefully, you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,682,000,000, which was down 4% with negative currency impact accounting for 3% of this decrease. Net income was $161.3 million, which was down 3%. Earnings per share were $1.07 this year, which was even with last year, and currency negatively impacted the EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. For the full year, sales were $15,280,000,000, which was down 0.4%, with currency costing us 3 points of revenue growth. Net income was $706 million, which was down just under 1% and earnings per share were $4.63 this year compared to $4.61 in 2014. And for the full year, the currency impact was $0.14. 
After several years of solid performances, 2015 proved to be a more challenging year for us, largely attributable to the combination of the significant slowdown experienced in our Industrial and Electrical businesses and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange, primarily on our Automotive business. Fortunately, as you will hear from Paul in a few minutes, the underlying fundamentals remain positive for the Automotive segment, and each of our automotive businesses are turning in solid local currency results. 
The Industrial operations, our second largest business segment representing 30% of total company sales in this past year, and they ended the year down 3%. And as we reported over the course of the year, we saw sequential revenue deceleration as the year progressed. After being up 3% in the first quarter, the Industrial operations were down 2% in Q2, down 4% in Q3 and down 8% in the fourth quarter. And these results are reflective of the sluggish end market conditions encountered by many of our industrial customers. Customers in the oil and gas original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental were all down double digits with us for the year. And as a point of information, the fourth quarter decreases were even more significant than the full year declines, indicating the ongoing challenges faced by customers in each of these segments. Conversely, customers in aggregate and cement, food products, automotive, lumber and wood products all generated positive results for us this past year. And in looking ahead, we would expect positive results from each of these customer categories in 2016 as well. 
At the same time, however, our expectation is for continued declines from customers in the oil and gas original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental categories for several more quarters, which will certainly be a headwind to our overall sales results. In an effort to offset this, our Industrial team remains focused on key elements of their sales strategy, including share of wallet initiatives with existing customers, expansion of our customer base, product line extensions and expanding our geographic footprint and product capabilities through acquisitions. And on this last point, we're pleased to report 2 acquisitions that are scheduled to close on March 1 with combined revenue of approximately $50 million and both companies nicely complement Motion's existing business and it will help our growth rates over the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to our Electrical segment, EIS ended the year with sales of $751 million, which was up 2% and represents 5% of total company revenues. As with Motion, EIS had mixed results among their segments. Customers in the Wire and Cable and Fabrication sides of the business generated nice increases while customers in the Electrical side had decreases. The Electrical segment represents about 40% of EIS' total revenue. And similar to Motion, we're probably a few quarters away from seeing stabilization in this segment. In the meantime, they're employing many of the same growth strategies as Motion, including acquisitions. And our expectation is to be in a position to announce a $50 million plus acquisition in the weeks ahead, which will certainly have a nice positive impact on the EIS results in 2016. 
And a few comments on our Office Products group, which represents 13% of total company sales in 2015. They ended the year with sales of just over $1.9 billion and this was up 7.5%. The Office Products growth was fueled by incremental acquisition revenue and strong double-digit growth from the Mega Channel. Our independent reseller business was down low single digits for the year, with most of this decrease coming in the second half of the year. On the product side, we had double-digit growth for the year in furniture and facility and break room supplies and mid-single-digit growth in our core Office Product supplies. And we are pleased with the progress made in each of these categories. Technology products were flat for the year. And looking at our Office Products results over the course of the year, it was really a tale of 2 halves, with first half revenues being up 16% and second half revenues being up just slightly. The upsized first half increases were driven by the aforementioned incremental acquisition volume and increased revenue from the Mega Channel that was anniversaried early in Q3. And then we feel our second half results are more reflective of the ongoing underlying sluggish conditions in the Office Products industry. Many of the ongoing issues within the industry are secular in nature. And as a result, our team continues to work on market share and share of wallet initiatives, product line additions and extensions, product and channel diversification as well as strategic acquisitions. You will recall that we completed the acquisition of Malt Industries late in 2015. Malt is a distributor of safety suppliers and protective apparel with annual sales of about $20 million. We are pleased with their progress to date. This acquisition helped to further diversify our product and channel portfolios, and we will pursue additional acquisition opportunities to continue this strategy in the quarters ahead. 
So that's a quick overview of the non-automotive segments, and Paul will now give you an update on the Automotive results. Paul?"

Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending",1586,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. 
For the quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were down 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 2.5% in core Automotive growth and a slight benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the impact of currency we saw throughout 2015. Our U.S. team posted a 2% sales increase in the fourth quarter compared with 3% growth experienced through the first 9 months of 2015. Our international businesses, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, we remain encouraged by the steady and consistent growth we are experiencing across all of our international markets. We see no reason for this not to continue in 2016. 
In the U.S., our results vary by geographical region. Our business in the North East, Florida, Central and Western regions of the country continue to deliver solid results. The Midwest, Mountain and Southwest regions of the country all came in below our expectations. Given our strong commercial presence with fleets, including many in the battered oil and gas sector, we felt the effects across many of our stores throughout the Mountain and Southwest regions. Particularly hard-hit were stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana and the Dakotas. We also are seeing the effects across many of our stores in Western Canada. We would also add the above average temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter across the Midwest and Mountain regions negatively impacted our winter good sales. 
Now let's turn to our same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew comp store sales in the fourth quarter by 2%. This compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through 9 months. Cadence of the quarter, our team posted solid results in both October and December. In fact, we are encouraged as we entered the fourth quarter as October same-store sales were our second-best results of the year. The month of November proved to be the outlier and we believe warmer-than-normal temps in the month caused this downturn. This quarter's 2% increase is on top of the 7% increase generated in the fourth quarter of 2014, giving us a 2-year stack of 9%. This increase was driven by a combination of gains on both our commercial side of our business as well as by our retail business. 
Let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in our Q3 call, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. These initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. And while we are in the early days of rolling out these initiatives, we are pleased with the initial results. Our plans call for us to expand our 20-store impact pilot in 2016 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the fourth quarter, we can report a total increase of 5% in our retail business. Coupling this 5% increase was the 11% increase we posted in Q4 of 2014, gives us a 2-year stack of 16%. For the full year, our retail business was up 6%. These gains are being driven by both transaction and basket size increases. In Q4, we experienced a mid-single-digit increase in our average retail ticket and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted 2% increase in the fourth quarter and a 2-year stack of 8%. So for the year, we can report a 3% increase in our commercial business. The core elements of this segment continue to center around our major account business and our NAPA AutoCare business. In 2015, we expanded our AutoCare membership count, which now totals 16,300-plus across the U.S. Both our AutoCare and Major Account businesses generated mid-single-digit growth for the year. We believe the slowdown in the Industrial sector had a material impact on our fleet business in the quarter. This business was up just 1% after delivering 3-plus percent increases in the previous 3 quarters. Our Q4 2-year stack in our fleet business now stands at 6%. 
Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digits, with little or no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the number of tickets moving through our stores. 
So now let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the quarter and it has been a strong category for us all year. The brakes category grew low double digits for us in the fourth quarter, and we also saw experienced -- we also experienced solid growth in our tool and equipment business. An area of concern would be in our battery business, which was off slightly in the quarter. We believe this was attributable to the warmer winter temperatures. And we can report this business has now bounced back in the month of January and our team drove a double-digit increase in the month of January. We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA Import Parts business. This business was up high single digits in the quarter and posted double-digit growth for the year. On February 1, we announced the acquisition of Olympus Import Parts. Olympus is a 30-year business, specialized in professional grade import auto parts. They currently operate out of 6 locations in the Northern Virginia and Greater D.C. area and generate approximately $25 million in annualized revenue. This business will be a nice complement to our growing NAPA import business as well as our Altrom import parts business. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to Mike Brown and the entire Olympus team to Genuine Parts Company. 
We'd also like to provide you with an update on the previously discussed acquisition target. During our third quarter call, we reviewed with you the pending acquisition of Covs Parts, a 25-branch distribution company based in Western Australia. While we had hoped to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, we encountered regulatory approval delays, moving the expected close of this transaction to no later than April 1 of this year. With approval for 21 branches, the addition of Covs Parts further expands our market presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million. This acquisition will expand our industry-leading presence in Australia and New Zealand and puts us over the 500-store mark. We are proud of our team in Asia Pacific and look forward to another solid year from this business in 2016. As we look to the immediate future, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains an excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to pose substantial gain. Miles driven actually increased 3.5% through the first 11 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is November, which was up 4.3% year-over-year, also a new record. This now makes 21 consecutive months of increases in miles driven and it certainly is driving -- these key metrics are driven by lower fuel cost.
The natural -- the national average price of gas in 2015 was $2.40 per gallon, which was the second lowest annual average in the past 10 years. Gas prices continue to move downward, and in most parts of the U.S. today, the average is less than $2 a gallon. These low gas prices should bode well for future increases in both miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we are pleased to show positive underlying Automotive growth for both the quarter and year in a challenging economic environment. And we are encouraged with the start to the New Year as our sales in January were more in line with our historical run rates. We remain hopeful we can carry this momentum through to the end of the quarter and the balance of 2016. 
As we move into 2016, our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. I want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. 
And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with the review of our financial results. Carol?"
275034,322612288,933858,"Genuine Parts Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and the segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues o",2240,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and the segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter were down 4% and consist of a decrease in underlying sales of 2%, a currency headwind of 3% and acquisitions contributed 1%. For the year, total revenues of $15.3 billion consisted of core sales growth of 1.5% and a 1% contribution from acquisitions offset by a 3% currency headwind. 
Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 29.75, down from 30.0 gross margin last year. And for the year gross margin of 29.8 compares to 29.9 reported last year. Primarily, our gross margins for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from improved margins in our Automotive, Office and Electrical businesses, but our growth in these segments was offset by the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. This directly related to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases for this group. We recognize the need for additional progress on this line and the importance of executing on our gross margin initiatives. This is a key priority for our management team, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
Our gross margin initiatives are critical to offset the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in Automotive. Our cumulative supplier price changes in 2015 were negative 20 basis points, 0.2% for Automotive, positive 90 basis points for Industrial, positive 60 basis points for Office Products and negative 1.75% for Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $834 million or 22.65% of sales, which is a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year. For the full year, our total expenses of $3.4 billion at 22.46% of sales are a 20 basis point improvement. The improvement in our SG&A expenses reflects the positive impact of our cost control measures across all of our businesses. Additionally, we had added savings of lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter relative to 2014. Overall, our cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by the deleveraging of expenses in our Industrial business as well as the increases in expenses across the company in areas such as employee benefits and retirement plans and health care. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations. We expect to show continued progress on this line in the periods ahead. 
If we look at our results for the segments, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $169 million is up 12.5% and their margin improved a strong 110 basis points due to the improved gross margins and expense controls. For the year, Automotive sales of $8 billion are down 1%. Our operating profit of $729 million is up 4% and our margin has improved by 40 basis points to 9.1%, so a solid margin expansion for Automotive in 2015. Our Industrial sales of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8%. Our operating profit is $72 million, is down 24.8% and our operating margin was down 150 basis points to 6.5%. For the year, Industrial sales of $4.6 billion are down 2.6% from the prior year and our operating profit is $339 million, is down 8.3% and our margin was 7.3%, which is down 50 basis points from last year. This is driven by lower incentives and expense deleverage, which pressured this group throughout the year but at a greater amount in the fourth quarter. Our 
Office Products revenues were $459 million in the quarter, down 2%. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and their operating margin of 7.3% is down 20 basis points. For the year, office revenues of $1.9 billion are up 7.5% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $141 million is up 5% and our margin of 7.3% is down 10 basis points from last year. 
The Electrical group had sales in the quarter of $177 million, which is basically flat with the prior year. Our operating profit of [indiscernible] million is up 6.7%. So the margin for this group showed strong growth as 60 basis points to 9.1%. For the year, sales for this group of $751 million are up 1.6% and their operating profit is $70 million, is up 9% and their margin improved to 9.3%, which is a solid 50 basis point increase from the prior year. 
For both the fourth quarter and the full year, our total operating margin improved by 10 basis points. For the quarter, the margin was 7.9% compared to 7.8% and, for the year, 8.4% compared to 8.3%. This improvement in 2015 follows our 30 basis point expansion in 2014. And given this current sales environment, we're very pleased with our continued progress in this area. Looking ahead, further margin expansion remains a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.3 million in the quarter, and for the 12 months, interest expense was $20.4 million, which compares to $24.2 million in 2014. For 2016, we currently estimate net interest expense to approximate $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $9 million for the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year is down slightly from 2014. We currently estimate total amortization expense of $36 million to $38 million for the full year in 2016. Our depreciation of $27 million for the fourth quarter and $107 million for the full year, and for 2016, we are projecting this to be approximately $120 million to $130 million. So combined, depreciation and amortization looking ahead would be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $16.3 million for the quarter, which is up slightly from the prior year quarter. For the full year, our corporate expense is $100.4 million, which is consistent with our expectations and up from the $90 million in the prior year. Primarily, unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $7 million and planned IT-related investments accounted for the increase on this line. 
Turning to 2016, we expect the corporate expense line to be in the $110 million to $120 million range for the full year. Our tax rate was 38.35% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in mix of our foreign income and the related foreign tax rates as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments recorded through the first 9 months of 2015. We currently expect our tax rate to approximate 37% for the full year in 2016. Our net income for the quarter of $161.3 million and our EPS of $1.07 was equal to the prior year. And for the year, our EPS of $4.63 was up slightly from the $4.61 for last year. 
Now let's talk about the balance sheet, which we strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at December was $212 million, which is an increase from $138 million at December 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support our growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at December 31 is down 3% from the prior year on a 4% decrease in sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2016. 
Accounts payable at December 31 was $2.8 billion, up 10%, and this is due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area and we're encouraged by its positive impact on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at December 31 has significantly improved from the prior year in both absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues. Our progress in this area contributed significantly to our record cash flows for the year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt at $625 million at December 31, is down approximately $140 million from the $765 million in the prior year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $125 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. Our debt to capitalization at 16.5% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that provides our company with both the financial capacity and the flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated record cash flows in 2015 driven in part by our improvement in working capital. Cash from operations was $1.2 billion and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, was $682 million. This is a meaningful accomplishment for us. And for 2016, we're currently planning for another strong year of cash flows. We would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. 
Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and their integral to the growth plans of our company. In 2015, we made a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our distribution footprint; and in total, these new businesses are expected to contribute $180 million in annual revenues. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus Import Parts distribution business, as covered by Paul, and looking forward in 2016, we will continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are still open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes large and small assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to our share repurchases in 2015, we used our cash to repurchase 3.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Through today, we have also purchased another 570,000 shares of stock, and today, we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we have been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our stock price over the last 12 to 14 months. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment in capital expenditures was $48 million for the fourth quarter, which is an increase from that $34 million in the prior year. For the year, our capital spending was $110 million, up slightly from the prior year. We are currently planning for capital expenditures to increase further in 2016 to approximately $140 million to $160 million, with the vast majority of our investments weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. 
Effective yesterday, the board approved a $2.63 per share annual dividend for 2016, marking our 60th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share and it's approximately 57% of our prior year earnings. This is slightly above our stated goal of a payout ratio of 50% to 55%, but we're comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year. And in summary, we operated in 2015 with relatively mixed results. That said, we improved the strength of our balance sheet with excellent working capital management and effective cost control measures helped us produce an expanded operating profit margin. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and a record earnings per share for 2015. These are meaningful accomplishments, and our progress in these areas supports our investment in growth opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders with the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the periods ahead, and I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and their commitment to their jobs. 
I'll turn it now back over to Tom."

And in closing, we would say, as mentioned earlier, that it was a challenging year in many ways, but a gratifying year in other ways. Our revenue production and local currencies were solid across our Automotive businesses as it was in Office Products, but Industrial and Electrical found it more difficult. We were pleased to see strong operating margin movements in Automotive and Electrical, but we had operating margin declines in Office Products and Industrial. We were, however, able to show a 10 basis point improvement for GPC overall despite the Office Products and Industrial challenges. 
Gross profit was down 12 basis points for the year, but good work was done on the SG&A side and SG&A was down 20 basis points. As a result, pretax income was up slightly, but due to the higher tax rate that Carol explained, net income was down slightly. On the balance sheet side, the progress was more consistent with cash from operations and free cash, both setting new records, and working capital was reduced once again in 2015. And we returned well over $600 million back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and we reinvested over $225 million back into the business through a combination of capital expenditures and acquisitions. And we expect to invest an additional $125 million in acquisitions over the next few months. And these CapEx and acquisition investments are intended to provide revenue and profit growth in the quarters ahead. 
Now turning to the year ahead. As a general statement, we would say that we remain quite cautious in our outlook. The general economic conditions look a bit fragile and perhaps tenuous both domestically and globally. And as mentioned earlier, this is already having a significant impact on certain segments of our customer base, primarily in Industrial and Electrical. Conversely, we think that the outlook for our Automotive segment is generally favorable, but the currency impact will once again be a headwind to our Automotive growth in 2015. With all of that said, at this point, we would expect our 2016 revenues to be up 2% to 3% in Automotive, with the currency headwind up 3%; Industrial, up 1% to 2%; Electrical, up 1% to 2%; Office Products, down 1% to up 1%, giving us a total GPC revenue expectation of being up 1% to 2% and up 3% to 4% before the currency impact. And with revenue growth at these levels, we would suggest an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.80, which will be up 1.5% to 3.5% after currency exchange impact of approximately $0.08 per share. And before the currency exchange impact, we'd be up 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Chris."

And once we've completed our individual comments, we look forward to addressing any specific questions that you may have. 
Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end results, and hopefully, you've all had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,682,000,000, which was down 4% with negative currency impact accounting for 3% of this decrease. Net income was $161.3 million, which was down 3%. Earnings per share were $1.07 this year, which was even with last year, and currency negatively impacted the EPS by $0.03 per share in the quarter. For the full year, sales were $15,280,000,000, which was down 0.4%, with currency costing us 3 points of revenue growth. Net income was $706 million, which was down just under 1% and earnings per share were $4.63 this year compared to $4.61 in 2014. And for the full year, the currency impact was $0.14. 
After several years of solid performances, 2015 proved to be a more challenging year for us, largely attributable to the combination of the significant slowdown experienced in our Industrial and Electrical businesses and the impact of unfavorable currency exchange, primarily on our Automotive business. Fortunately, as you will hear from Paul in a few minutes, the underlying fundamentals remain positive for the Automotive segment, and each of our automotive businesses are turning in solid local currency results. 
The Industrial operations, our second largest business segment representing 30% of total company sales in this past year, and they ended the year down 3%. And as we reported over the course of the year, we saw sequential revenue deceleration as the year progressed. After being up 3% in the first quarter, the Industrial operations were down 2% in Q2, down 4% in Q3 and down 8% in the fourth quarter. And these results are reflective of the sluggish end market conditions encountered by many of our industrial customers. Customers in the oil and gas original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental were all down double digits with us for the year. And as a point of information, the fourth quarter decreases were even more significant than the full year declines, indicating the ongoing challenges faced by customers in each of these segments. Conversely, customers in aggregate and cement, food products, automotive, lumber and wood products all generated positive results for us this past year. And in looking ahead, we would expect positive results from each of these customer categories in 2016 as well. 
At the same time, however, our expectation is for continued declines from customers in the oil and gas original equipment manufacturing, iron and steel and heavy equipment rental categories for several more quarters, which will certainly be a headwind to our overall sales results. In an effort to offset this, our Industrial team remains focused on key elements of their sales strategy, including share of wallet initiatives with existing customers, expansion of our customer base, product line extensions and expanding our geographic footprint and product capabilities through acquisitions. And on this last point, we're pleased to report 2 acquisitions that are scheduled to close on March 1 with combined revenue of approximately $50 million and both companies nicely complement Motion's existing business and it will help our growth rates over the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to our Electrical segment, EIS ended the year with sales of $751 million, which was up 2% and represents 5% of total company revenues. As with Motion, EIS had mixed results among their segments. Customers in the Wire and Cable and Fabrication sides of the business generated nice increases while customers in the Electrical side had decreases. The Electrical segment represents about 40% of EIS' total revenue. And similar to Motion, we're probably a few quarters away from seeing stabilization in this segment. In the meantime, they're employing many of the same growth strategies as Motion, including acquisitions. And our expectation is to be in a position to announce a $50 million plus acquisition in the weeks ahead, which will certainly have a nice positive impact on the EIS results in 2016. 
And a few comments on our Office Products group, which represents 13% of total company sales in 2015. They ended the year with sales of just over $1.9 billion and this was up 7.5%. The Office Products growth was fueled by incremental acquisition revenue and strong double-digit growth from the Mega Channel. Our independent reseller business was down low single digits for the year, with most of this decrease coming in the second half of the year. On the product side, we had double-digit growth for the year in furniture and facility and break room supplies and mid-single-digit growth in our core Office Product supplies. And we are pleased with the progress made in each of these categories.
 Technology products were flat for the year. And looking at our Office Products results over the course of the year, it was really a tale of 2 halves, with first half revenues being up 16% and second half revenues being up just slightly. The upsized first half increases were driven by the aforementioned incremental acquisition volume and increased revenue from the Mega Channel that was anniversaried early in Q3. And then we feel our second half results are more reflective of the ongoing underlying sluggish conditions in the Office Products industry. 
Many of the ongoing issues within the industry are secular in nature. And as a result, our team continues to work on market share and share of wallet initiatives, product line additions and extensions, product and channel diversification as well as strategic acquisitions. You will recall that we completed the acquisition of Malt Industries late in 2015. Malt is a distributor of safety suppliers and protective apparel with annual sales of about $20 million. We are pleased with their progress to date. This acquisition helped to further diversify our product and channel portfolios, and we will pursue additional acquisition opportunities to continue this strategy in the quarters ahead. 
So that's a quick overview of the non-automotive segments, and Paul will now give you an update on the Automotive results. Paul?"

Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending",1584,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you here today and have an opportunity to provide you an update on our fourth quarter performance of our Automotive business. 
For the quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were down 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 2.5% in core Automotive growth and a slight benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the impact of currency we saw throughout 2015. Our U.S. team posted a 2% sales increase in the fourth quarter compared with 3% growth experienced through the first 9 months of 2015. Our international businesses, which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, we remain encouraged by the steady and consistent growth we are experiencing across all of our international markets. We see no reason for this not to continue in 2016. 
In the U.S., our results vary by geographical region. Our business in the Northeast, Florida, Central and Western regions of the country continue to deliver solid results. The Midwest, Mountain and Southwest regions of the country all came in below our expectations. Given our strong commercial presence with fleets, including many in the battered oil and gas sector, we felt the effects across many of our stores throughout the Mountain and Southwest regions. Particularly hard-hit were stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana and the Dakotas. We also are seeing the effects across many of our stores in Western Canada. We would also add the above average temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter across the Midwest and Mountain regions negatively impacted our winter good sales. 
Now let's turn to our same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew comp store sales in the fourth quarter by 2%. This compares to the 3% comp store increase we reported through 9 months. Cadence of the quarter, our team posted solid results in both October and December. In fact, we are encouraged as we entered the fourth quarter as October same-store sales were our second-best results of the year. The month of November proved to be the outlier and we believe warmer-than-normal temps in the month caused this downturn. This quarter's 2% increase is on top of the 7% increase generated in the fourth quarter of 2014, giving us a 2-year stack of 9%. This increase was driven by a combination of gains on both our commercial side of our business as well as by our retail business. 
Let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in our Q3 call, we continue to expand or revamp DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. These initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. And while we are in the early days of rolling out these initiatives, we are pleased with the initial results. Our plans call for us to expand our 20-store impact pilot in 2016 to include an additional 150 company-owned stores. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results. And for the fourth quarter, we can report a total increase of 5% in our retail business. Coupling this 5% increase was the 11% increase we posted in Q4 of 2014, gives us a 2-year stack of 16%. 
For the full year, our retail business was up 6%. These gains are being driven by both transaction and basket size increases. In Q4, we experienced a mid-single-digit increase in our average retail ticket and a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted 2% increase in the fourth quarter and a 2-year stack of 8%. So for the year, we can report a 3% increase in our commercial business. The core elements of this segment continue to center around our major account business and our NAPA AutoCare business. In 2015, we expanded our AutoCare membership count, which now totals 16,300-plus across the U.S. Both our AutoCare and Major Accounts businesses generated mid-single-digit growth for the year. We believe the slowdown in the Industrial sector had a material impact on our fleet business in the quarter. This business was up just 1% after delivering 3-plus percent increases in the previous 3 quarters. Our Q4 2-year stack in our fleet business now stands at 6%. 
Our wholesale ticket trend was consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was up mid-single digits, with little or no benefit from inflation, while we saw a slight decline in the number of tickets moving through our stores. 
So now let's take a look at a few of our key product categories and review the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Our brakes category was a highlight again in the quarter and it has been a strong category for us all year. The brakes category grew low double digits for us in the fourth quarter, and we also saw experienced -- we also experienced solid growth in our tool and equipment business. An area of concern would be in our battery business, which was off slightly in the quarter. We believe this was attributable to the warmer winter temperatures. We can report this business has now bounced back in the month of January and our team drove a double-digit increase in the month of January. 
We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA Import Parts business. This business was up high single digits in the quarter and posted double-digit growth for the year. On February 1, we announced the acquisition of Olympus Import Parts. Olympus is a 30-year business, specialized in professional grade import auto parts. They currently operate out of 6 locations in the Northern Virginia and Greater D.C. area and generate approximately $25 million in annualized revenue. This business will be a nice complement to our growing NAPA import business as well as our Altrom import parts business. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to Mike Brown and the entire Olympus team to Genuine Parts Company. 
We'd also like to provide you with an update on the previously discussed acquisition target. During our third quarter call, we reviewed with you the pending acquisition of Covs Parts, a 25-branch distribution company based in Western Australia. While we had hoped to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, we encountered regulatory approval delays, moving the expected close of this transaction to no later than April 1 of this year. With approval for 21 branches, the addition of Covs Parts further expands our market presence and scale in Western Australia and is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million. This acquisition will expand our industry-leading presence in Australia and New Zealand and puts us over the 500-store mark. We are proud of our team in Asia Pacific and look forward to another solid year from this business in 2016. As we look to the immediate future, strategic M&A will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains an excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to pose substantial gain. Miles driven actually increased 3.5% through the first 11 months of the year, which is a new record. In addition, the latest month with reported figures is November, which was up 4.3% year-over-year, also a new record. This now makes 21 consecutive months of increases in miles driven and it certainly is driving -- these key metrics are driven by lower fuel cost.
The natural -- the national average price of gas in 2015 was $2.40 per gallon, which was the second lowest annual average in the past 10 years. Gas prices continue to move downward, and in most parts of the U.S. today, the average is less than $2 a gallon. These low gas prices should bode well for future increases in both miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we are pleased to show positive underlying Automotive growth for both the quarter and year in a challenging economic environment. And we are encouraged with the start to the New Year as our sales in January were more in line with our historical run rates. We remain hopeful we can carry this momentum through to the end of the quarter and the balance of 2016. 
As we move into 2016, our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. I want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. 
And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with the review of our financial results. Carol?"
275034,322612288,934105,"Genuine Parts Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and the segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues o",2240,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year income statements and the segment information and then we'll review some key balance sheet and other financial items. As Tom mentioned, our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter were down 4% and consist of a decrease in underlying sales of 2%, a currency headwind of 3% and acquisitions contributed 1%. For the year, total revenues of $15.3 billion consisted of core sales growth of 1.5% and a 1% contribution from acquisitions offset by a 3% currency headwind. 
Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was 29.75, down from 30.0 gross margin last year. And for the year gross margin of 29.8 compares to 29.9 reported last year. Primarily, our gross margins for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from improved margins in our Automotive, Office and Electrical businesses, but our growth in these segments was offset by the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. This directly related to the sluggish sales environment and lower inventory purchases for this group. We recognize the need for additional progress on this line and the importance of executing on our gross margin initiatives. This is a key priority for our management team, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
Our gross margin initiatives are critical to offset the low inflationary environment that has persisted across our businesses for several years now, especially in Automotive. Our cumulative supplier price changes in 2015 were negative 20 basis points, 0.2% for Automotive, positive 90 basis points for Industrial, positive 60 basis points for Office Products and negative 1.75% for Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A, our total expenses for the fourth quarter were $834 million or 22.65% of sales, which is a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year. For the full year, our total expenses of $3.4 billion at 22.46% of sales are a 20 basis point improvement. The improvement in our SG&A expenses reflects the positive impact of our cost control measures across all of our businesses. Additionally, we had added savings of lower incentive compensation in the fourth quarter relative to 2014. Overall, our cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by the deleveraging of expenses in our Industrial business as well as the increases in expenses across the company in areas such as employee benefits and retirement plans and health care. Our teams remain focused on controlling expenses and we continue to take actions to further improve our productivity and streamline our operations. We expect to show continued progress on this line in the periods ahead. 
If we look at our results for the segments, our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $169 million is up 12.5% and their margin improved a strong 110 basis points due to the improved gross margins and expense controls. For the year, Automotive sales of $8 billion are down 1%. Our operating profit of $729 million is up 4% and our margin has improved by 40 basis points to 9.1%, so a solid margin expansion for Automotive in 2015. Our Industrial sales of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8%. Our operating profit is $72 million, is down 24.8% and our operating margin was down 150 basis points to 6.5%. 
For the year, Industrial sales of $4.6 billion are down 2.6% from the prior year and our operating profit of $339 million, is down 8.3% and our margin was 7.3%, which is down 50 basis points from last year. This is driven by lower incentives and expense deleverage, which pressured this group throughout the year but at a greater amount in the fourth quarter. 
Our Office Products revenues were $459 million in the quarter, down 2%. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and their operating margin of 7.3% is down 20 basis points. For the year, office revenues of $1.9 billion are up 7.5% from the prior year. Our operating profit of $141 million is up 5% and our margin of 7.3% is down 10 basis points from last year. 
The Electrical group had sales in the quarter of $177 million, which is basically flat with the prior year. Our operating profit of $16 million is up 6.7%. So the margin for this group showed strong growth as 60 basis points to 9.1%. For the year, sales for this group of $751 million are up 1.6% and their operating profit of $70 million, is up 9% and their margin improved to 9.3%, which is a solid 50 basis point increase from the prior year. 
For both the fourth quarter and the full year, our total operating margin improved by 10 basis points. For the quarter, the margin was 7.9% compared to 7.8% and, for the year, 8.4% compared to 8.3%. This improvement in 2015 follows our 30 basis point expansion in 2014. And given this current sales environment, we're very pleased with our continued progress in this area. Looking ahead, further margin expansion remains a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.3 million in the quarter, and for the 12 months, interest expense was $20.4 million, which compares to $24.2 million in 2014. For 2016, we currently estimate net interest expense to approximate $21 million to $22 million for the full year. Our total amortization expense of $9 million for the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year is down slightly from 2014. We currently estimate total amortization expense of $36 million to $38 million for the full year in 2016. Our depreciation of $27 million for the fourth quarter and $107 million for the full year, and for 2016, we are projecting this to be approximately $120 million to $130 million. So combined, depreciation and amortization looking ahead would be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $16.3 million for the quarter, which is up slightly from the prior year quarter. For the full year, our corporate expense is $100.4 million, which is consistent with our expectations and up from the $90 million in the prior year. Primarily, unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments of $7 million and planned IT-related investments accounted for the increase on this line. 
Turning to 2016, we expect the corporate expense line to be in the $110 million to $120 million range for the full year. Our tax rate was 38.35% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. These rates are up from 2014 due to the changes in mix of our foreign income and the related foreign tax rates as well as the unfavorable retirement plan valuation adjustments recorded through the first 9 months of 2015. We currently expect our tax rate to approximate 37% for the full year in 2016. Our net income for the quarter of $161.3 million and our EPS of $1.07 was equal to the prior year. And for the year, our EPS of $4.63 was up slightly from the $4.61 for last year. 
Now let's talk about the balance sheet, which we strengthened in the fourth quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at December was $212 million, which is an increase from $138 million at December 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support our growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $1.8 billion at December 31 is down 3% from the prior year on a 4% decrease in sales in the fourth quarter. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Our team continues to do a very good job of managing our inventory levels and we will remain focused on maintaining this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward in 2016. 
Accounts payable at December 31 was $2.8 billion, up 10%, and this is due to the positive impact of our improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're pleased with our continued improvement in this area and we're encouraged by its positive impact on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at December 31 has significantly improved from the prior year in both absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues. Our progress in this area contributed significantly to our record cash flows for the year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, our accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt at $625 million at December 31, is down approximately $140 million from the $765 million in the prior year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $125 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. Our debt to capitalization at 16.5% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that provides our company with both the financial capacity and the flexibility necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We generated record cash flows in 2015 driven in part by our improvement in working capital. Cash from operations was $1.2 billion and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, was $682 million. This is a meaningful accomplishment for us. And for 2016, we're currently planning for another strong year of cash flows. We would expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $450 million. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. 
Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and they're integral to the growth plans of our company. In 2015, we made a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our distribution footprint; and in total, these new businesses are expected to contribute $180 million in annual revenues. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus Import Parts distribution business, as covered by Paul, and looking forward in 2016, we will continue to seek new acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are still open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes large and small assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to our share repurchases in 2015, we used our cash to repurchase 3.3 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program. Through today, we have also purchased another 570,000 shares of stock, and today, we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we have been slightly more aggressive with our repurchases given the value of our stock price over the last 12 to 14 months. We expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment in capital expenditures was $48 million for the fourth quarter, which is an increase from that $34 million in the prior year. For the year, our capital spending was $110 million, up slightly from the prior year. We are currently planning for capital expenditures to increase further in 2016 to approximately $140 million to $160 million, with the vast majority of our investments weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. 
Effective yesterday, the board approved a $2.63 per share annual dividend for 2016, marking our 60th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders. This represents a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share and it's approximately 57% of our prior year earnings. This is slightly above our stated goal of a payout ratio of 50% to 55%, but we're comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So this concludes our financial update for the fourth quarter and the full year. And in summary, we operated in 2015 with relatively mixed results. That said, we improved the strength of our balance sheet with excellent working capital management and effective cost control measures helped us produce an expanded operating profit margin. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and a record earnings per share for 2015. These are meaningful accomplishments, and our progress in these areas supports our investment in growth opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders with the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the periods ahead, and I'd like to thank all of our GPC associates for their hard work and their commitment to their jobs. 
I'll turn it now back over to Tom."

So that will conclude our prepared comments on 2015. And in closing, we would say, as mentioned earlier, that it was a challenging year in many ways, but a gratifying year in other ways.

And in closing, we would say, as mentioned earlier, that it was a challenging year in many ways, but a gratifying year in other ways. Our revenue production in local currencies were solid across our Automotive businesses as it was in Office Products, but Industrial and Electrical found it more difficult. We were pleased to see strong operating margin movements in Automotive and Electrical, but we had operating margin declines in Office Products and Industrial. We were, however, able to show a 10 basis point improvement for GPC overall despite the Office Products and Industrial challenges. 
Gross profit was down 12 basis points for the year, but good work was done on the SG&A side and SG&A was down 20 basis points. As a result, pretax income was up slightly, but due to the higher tax rate that Carol explained, net income was down slightly. On the balance sheet side, the progress was more consistent with cash from operations and free cash, both setting new records, and working capital was reduced once again in 2015. And we returned well over $600 million back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and we reinvested over $225 million back into the business through a combination of capital expenditures and acquisitions. And we expect to invest an additional $125 million in acquisitions over the next few months. And these CapEx and acquisition investments are intended to drive revenue and profit growth in the quarters ahead. 
And turning to the year ahead, as a general statement, we would say that we remain quite cautious in our outlook. The general economic conditions look a bit fragile and perhaps tenuous both domestically and globally. And as mentioned earlier, this is already having a significant impact on certain segments of our customer base, primarily in Industrial and Electrical. Conversely, we think that the outlook for our Automotive segment is generally favorable, but the currency impact will once again be a headwind to our Automotive growth in 2015. With all of that said, at this point, we would expect our 2016 revenues to be up 2% to 3% in Automotive, with the currency headwind up 3%; Industrial, up 1% to 2%; Electrical, up 1% to 2%; Office Products, down 1% to up 1%, giving us a total GPC revenue expectation of being up 1% to 2% and up 3% to 4% before the currency impact. And with revenue growth at these levels, we would suggest an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.80, which will be up 1.5% to 3.5% after currency exchange impact of approximately $0.08 per share. And before the currency exchange impact, we'd be up 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Chris."

But again some of it is the timing on projects, but we're certainly comfortable with the range we've given. And then you mentioned on the improvements for cash flow, I mean one of our sources of cash from operations was in the decrease in accounts receivable. We had almost a $200 million source from accounts receivable more related to our decrease in sales. So that's why we're guiding to a little bit lower number because we think that receivables won't be as much of a help to us in 2016."

Again, the comment I made about we'll be adding $50 million of annualized revenue as of March 1 with the 2 acquisitions that we're making, that's one thing. And then the second thing, it's -- the 6 weeks does not a trend make by any stretch. But what we saw on a per-day basis in January and what we've seen through midmonth February is a little bit better than what we experienced certainly in Q4 of this past year.

And once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,718,000,000, which was down 1/2 of 1%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which is even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year. Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to our overall results. The impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way, in constant currency, sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged primarily on our non-Automotive businesses, and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact. 
In constant currency, our Automotive business was up 4.4%, Industrial was down 1.7%, Office Products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our Automotive operations and the remaining 3 segments is quite pronounced and Paul will cover the Automotive segment in a few minutes. But first, I'll make a few comments on the non-Automotive businesses starting with Industrial. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continue to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for 2 reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3%, and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was the smallest decrease that we've seen in several quarters. Additionally, our midmonth April results are modestly positive, and hopefully, this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead. 
However, it is important to point out that if we look at our performance by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first, we have 6 that are up and 6 that are down. On the positive side in no order are lumber and wood products, food products, ag and cement, chemicals and automotive. On the downside, we have oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing. Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far but 5 are down. In our top 12 product categories, 6 are up and 6 are down. So as you can see, it's a real mixture with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas, and all of this, in our opinion, is reflective of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we'll face a bit longer and we'll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions. 
Moving on to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. This group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business were headwinds for the Electrical segment as well: things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter, which cost us just over 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors we think will persist for a bit longer. But it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. You may recall that the Electrical segment is our largest, representing about 40% of the total company revenue. Fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30%, and it's interesting that fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but Electrical was down midteens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments. 
And finally, a few comments on Office Products. As reported earlier, this segment was down 3% in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel being offset by high single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results ending the quarter with a high single-digit increase, and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even followed by a slight decline in Office Products and a low double-digit decrease in technology products. 
Putting it all together, we're making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom. Overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they're working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they continue to work on diversifying their business through new products additions and the opening of new sales channels, and we hope to report in the next call that we're able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts. So that's a quick overview of our non-Automotive businesses. 
And at this point, we'll ask Paul to cover the Automotive operations. Paul?"
275034,329405723,959445,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March",1491,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total Automotive growth which includes an approximate 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter and improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015. 
Turning to our international business, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. This group once again reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in their local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid-single-digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets. 
In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically, our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all outperformed in the quarter. On the other hand, the central, the eastern, midwestern regions of the country all underperformed. We would attribute the warmer-than-average temperatures experienced across the northern states in February and March is having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country. And as we look at our winter-related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double-digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again, we believe warmer-than-normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business. 
So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6%. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. Again, we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in '15 to March in 2016. This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as our retail business. 
So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder, these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. We are still early in the process but we can result -- we can report the results we have seen thus far outpacing our expectations. 
As previously announced, we are expanding our initial 20-store pilot, which we tested in 2015 that would include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results, and for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. When we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gives us a 2-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts, and in quarter 1, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single-digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Accounts business as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000-plus AutoCare customers as this business trended up mid to high-single digits. On the Major Account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall Automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And while it's early, we are hard -- working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group. Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digits with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we have seen in recent quarters. 
So earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business. So now let's take a look at a few of our other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter. Our brakes business was a highlighted again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses. 
We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. Our underlying import parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus import parts, a $25 million business we acquired this past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket. 
We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows their Asia Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia Pac team, and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately $70 million in U.S. dollars. 
On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our Automotive business. We are pleased to report today we'll be closing on May 1 on Atlanta Georgia-based heavy-duty truck parts business. We would like to welcome the team from Global Parts Incorporated. Global operates 6 branches in 3 states and generates sales of approximately $20 million-plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive business both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Now turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positives. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to pose substantial gains. Miles driven increased 2% in January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015. January marks  23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas is $2 in the first quarter, which is down from $2.40 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in the recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year, and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we were pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platform, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. We want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. 
So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?"

We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial",1786,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7% compared to 29.8% last year. The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. Excluding this a factor, we're pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all our businesses. 
On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost-saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment. I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We're down 0.6% in Automotive. We're up 0.2% in Industrial. We're up 0.1% in office and we're down 1.25% in Electrical. So talking about SG&A again, I'm sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter last year. So our cost control measures continue to positively impact our results and are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-Automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we move ahead. 
Now let's discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of $154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Products revenues were $477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of $176 million, down 3.4% and that's 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4. 
For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-Automotive businesses. We're intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.8 million the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was $8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense of $26 million for the quarter, we're now projecting for depreciation to remain at $120 million to $130 million for the full year. So combined depreciation and amortization of $34.7 million for the first quarter, and we would expect this to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million for the full year. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $24.4 million for the quarter compared to $25.1 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, which is in line with the first quarter last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project a 37% tax rate for the full year. Our net income for the quarter of $158 million compares to $161 million for last year and our EPS was $1.05, which is flat with last year. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of the balance sheet, which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was $205 million, which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from the $166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable at $2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase, although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at March 31 was $3 billion, up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down $67 million on a comparable basis, which excludes the reclassification of the $250 million in term debt from long term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of $700 million at March 31 is $194 million less than $894 million in March of last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We will also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 18% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we appear well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. 
We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing an important use of cash for us and are integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as 3 additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of USD 70 million. And Motion added [indiscernible] company and Missouri power transmission with combined annual revenues of $50 million. For the balance of 2016, we'll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on the investments. 
Turning to share repurchases. We have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $12 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year. For the year, however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. So you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. While slightly above our stated goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio, we're very comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary, we operated relatively in line with our expectations, which assumed fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our non-Automotive businesses. We managed to offset some of these challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Tom."

So that's an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive Group turning in the best performance. The lack of revenue growth in the non-Automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating leverage unfortunately. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we feel that our folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth, and across all our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt-on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front, based upon what we see right now, we think that we'd have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters. Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we feel that our previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full year against the current 1.8% increase. We said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to their 2.5% decrease for the first quarter, Office Products down 1% to up 2% compared to a 2.8% increase -- decrease in the quarter, and Electrical will be up 1% to 2% compared to the 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company, we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the 0.5% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate and this will be up 2% to 4% over prior year. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Kathlyn."

When we look at gross margin, the other 4 -- the other 3 segments are fine. The pressure on gross margin was through Industrial and so a lot of our initiatives are in place.

The pressure on gross margin was through Industrial and so a lot of our initiatives are in place. And as we mentioned, Industrial has done really good job. Their core gross profit was up in Q4 and was also up in Q1. So they've done a lot of things on the buy side and sell side to help that get that up. So when the volume does come back and it probably needs to be more in the very low single-digit range for us to get some of that volume incentives back, that's going to really go straight to the margin. But the good thing is the SG&A improvement and the core gross profit, those things are already in place. And when we do get just a little bit of volume back in the top line growth and we'll see that on their operating margins."

And once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,718,000,000, which was down 0.5%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which is even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year. Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to our overall results. The impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way, in constant currency, sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged, primarily on our non-Automotive businesses, and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact. 
In constant currency, our Automotive business was up 4.4%, Industrial was down 1.7%, Office Products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our Automotive operations and the remaining 3 segments is quite pronounced, and Paul will cover the Automotive segment in a few minutes. But first, I'll make a few comments on the non-Automotive businesses, starting with Industrial. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continue to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for 2 reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3%; and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was the smallest decrease that we've seen in several quarters. Additionally, our midmonth April results are modestly positive, and hopefully, this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead. 
However, it is important to point out that if we look at our performance by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first, we have 6 that are up and 6 that are down. On the positive side, in no order, are lumber and wood products, food products, ag and cement, chemicals and automotive. On the downside, we have oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing. Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but 5 are down. In our top 12 product categories, 6 are up and 6 are down. So as you can see, it's a real mixture, with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this, in our opinion, is reflective of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we'll face for a bit longer and we'll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions. 
Moving on to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. This group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business were headwinds for the Electrical segment as well: things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment; lower defense spending; lower copper pricing again in the quarter, which cost us just over 1% of sales growth; the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers; and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors, we think, will persist for a bit longer. But it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. You may recall that the Electrical segment is our largest, representing about 40% of the total company revenue. Fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30%, and it's interesting that fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but Electrical was down midteens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments. 
And finally, a few comments on Office Products. As reported earlier, this segment was down 3% in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel being offset by high single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results, ending the quarter with a high single-digit increase, and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even, followed by a slight decline in Office Products and a low double-digit decrease in technology products. 
Putting it all together, we're making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom. Overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they're working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they continue to work on diversifying their business through new products additions and the opening of new sales channels, and we hope to report in the next call that we're able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts. So that's a quick overview of our non-Automotive businesses. 
And at this point, we'll ask Paul to cover the Automotive operations. Paul?"
275034,329405723,959503,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March",1487,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total Automotive growth which includes an approximate 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter and improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015. 
Turning to our international business, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. This group once again reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in their local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid-single-digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets. 
In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically, our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all outperformed in the quarter. On the other hand, the central, the eastern, midwestern regions of the country all underperformed. We would attribute the warmer-than-average temperatures experienced across the northern states in February and March as having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country. And as we look at our winter-related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double-digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again, we believe warmer-than-normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business. 
So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6%. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January, with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. Again, we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in '15 to March in 2016. This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as our retail business. 
So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder, these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can result -- we can report the results we have seen thus far outpacing our expectations. 
As previously announced, we are expanding our initial 20-store pilot, which we tested in 2015 that would include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results, and for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. When we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gives us a 2-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts, and in quarter 1, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single-digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare Centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000-plus AutoCare customers, as this business trended up mid to high-single digits. On the Major Account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall Automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And while it's early, we are hard -- working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group. Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digits with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we have seen in recent quarters. 
So earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business. So now let's take a look at a few of our other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter. Our brakes business was a highlight again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses. 
We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. Our underlying import parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business we acquired this past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket. 
We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows their Asia Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia Pac team, and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million.
On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever-increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our Automotive business. We are pleased to report today we'll be closing on May 1 on our Atlanta, Georgia-based heavy-duty truck parts business. We'd like to welcome the team from Global Parts, Inc. Global operates 6 branches in 3 states and generates sales of approximately $20 million-plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive business both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Now turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to pose substantial gains. Miles driven increased 2% in January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015. January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the first quarter, which is down from $2.40 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year, and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we were pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platform, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. We want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts, and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. 
So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?"

We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial",1789,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7% compared to 29.8% last year. The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. Excluding this factor, we're pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses. 
On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost-saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment. I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We're down 0.6% in Automotive. We're up 0.2% in Industrial. We're up 0.1% in office and we're down 1.25% in Electrical. So talking about SG&A again, I'm sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter last year. So our cost control measures continue to positively impact our results and are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-Automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we move ahead. 
Now let's discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of $154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Products revenues were $477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of $176 million, down 3.4% and that's 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4. 
For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-Automotive businesses. We're intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.8 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was $8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense of $26 million for the quarter, we're now projecting for depreciation to remain at $120 million to $130 million for the full year. So combined depreciation and amortization of $34.7 million for the first quarter, and we would expect this to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million for the full year. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $24.4 million for the quarter compared to $25.1 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, which is in line with the first quarter last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project a 37% tax rate for the full year. Our net income for the quarter of $158 million compares to $161 million for last year and our EPS was $1.05, which is flat with last year. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of the balance sheet, which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was $205 million, which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from the $166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable at $2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase, although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at March 31 was $3 billion, up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down $67 million on a comparable basis, which excludes the reclassification of the $250 million in term debt from long term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of $700 million at March 31 is $194 million less than $894 million in March of last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We want to also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 18%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we appear well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. 
We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as 3 additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of USD 70 million. And Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission, with combined annual revenues of $50 million. For the balance of 2016, we'll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on the investments. 
Turning to share repurchases. We have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $12 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year. For the year, however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. So you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. While slightly above our stated goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio, we're very comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary, we operated relatively in line with our expectations, which assumed fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our non-Automotive businesses. We managed to offset some of these challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Tom."

So that's an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive Group turning in the best performance. The lack of revenue growth in the non-Automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating leverage, unfortunately. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we feel that our folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth, and across all our businesses, organic growth initiatives, strategic bolt-on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front, based upon what we see right now, we think that we'll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters. Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we feel that our previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full year against the current 1.8% increase. We said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to their 2.5% decrease for the first quarter, Office Products down 1% to up 2% compared to a 2.8% increase -- decrease in the quarter, and Electrical will be up 1% to 2% compared to the 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company, we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the 0.5% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate, and this will be up 2% to 4% over prior year. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Kathlyn."

And then the third thing is we've had a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread investments, spread the risks, so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said, if we were to find, I think you used the word transformational, if we were to find something larger, we would be more then happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within 3 years; and we look for a 15% ROIC no later than the third year.

And once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,718,000,000, which was down 0.5%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which is even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year. Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to our overall results. The impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way, in constant currency, sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged, primarily on our non-automotive businesses, and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact. 
In constant currency, our automotive business was up 4.4%, industrial was down 1.7%, office products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our automotive operations and the remaining 3 segments is quite pronounced, and Paul will cover the automotive segment in a few minutes. But first, I'll make a few comments on the non-automotive businesses, starting with industrial. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continue to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for two reasons. First, the First Quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3%; and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was the smallest decrease that we've seen in several quarters. Additionally, our mid-month April results are modestly positive, and hopefully, this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead. 
However, it is important to point out that if we look at our performance by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first, we have 6 that are up and 6 that are down. On the positive side, in no order, are lumber and wood products, food products, ag and cement, chemicals and automotive. On the downside, we have oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing. Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but 5 are down. In our top 12 product categories, 6 are up and 6 are down. So as you can see, it's a real mixture, with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this, in our opinion, is reflective of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we'll face for a bit longer and we'll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions. 
Moving on to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. This group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the electrical segment as well: Things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment; lower defense spending; lower copper pricing again in the quarter; which cost us just over 1% of sales growth; the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers; and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors, we think, will persist for a bit longer. But it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. You may recall that the electrical segment is our largest, representing about 40% of the total company revenue. fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30%, and it's interesting that fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but electrical was down mid-teens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments. 
And finally, a few comments on office products. As reported earlier, this segment was down 3% in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel being offset by high single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility break-room supply category turned in the strongest results, ending the quarter with a high single-digit increase, and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even, followed by a slight decline in office products and a low double-digit decrease in technology products. 
Putting it all together, while making good progress in areas like facility and break-room, overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they're working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they continue to work on diversifying their business through new product additions and the opening of new sales channels, and we hope to report in the next call that we're able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts. So that's a quick overview of our non-automotive businesses. 
And at this point, we'll ask Paul to cover the automotive operations. Paul?"
275034,329405723,959568,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending March",1487,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31, our global automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total automotive growth which includes an approximate 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the First Quarter. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter and improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the Fourth Quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015. 
Turning to our international business, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. This group once again reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in their local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid-single-digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets. 
In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically, our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all outperformed in the quarter. On the other hand, the Central, the Eastern, Midwestern regions of the country all underperformed. We would attribute the warmer-than-average temperatures experienced across the northern states in February and March as having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country. And as we look at our winter-related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double-digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again, we believe warmer-than-normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business. 
So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6%. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January, with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. Again, we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in '15 to March in 2016. This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as our retail business. 
So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder, these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can result -- we can report the results we have seen thus far are outpacing our expectations. 
As previously announced, we are expanding our initial 20-store pilot -- which we tested in 2015 -- to include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results, and for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. When we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gives us a 2-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts, and in Quarter 1, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single-digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our automotive business posted a 4% increase in the First Quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the Fourth Quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our major account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare Centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000-plus AutoCare customers, as this business trended up mid- to high single digits. On the major account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And while it's early, we are working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group. Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digits with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we have seen in recent quarters. 
So earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business. So now let's take a look at a few of our other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the First Quarter. Our brakes business was a highlight again in the First Quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses. 
We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. Our underlying import parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts; a $25 million business we acquired this past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket. 
We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows our Asia Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia Pac team, and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million.
On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever-increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our automotive business. We are pleased to report today we'll be closing on May 1, our Atlanta, Georgia-based heavy-duty truck parts business. We'd like to welcome the team from Global Parts, Inc. Global operates 6 branches in 3 states and generates sales of approximately $20 million-plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for our automotive business both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Now turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 2% in January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015. January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the First Quarter, which is down from $2.40 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year, and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we are pleased to show positive sales growth in the First Quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. We want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts, and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. 
So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?"

We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our First Quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial",1790,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our First Quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the First Quarter were down 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the First Quarter was 29.7% compared to 29.8% last year. The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our industrial business. Excluding this factor, we're pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses. 
On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost-saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment. I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We're down 0.6% in automotive. We're up 0.2% in industrial. We're up 0.1% in office and we're down 1.25% in electrical. So talking about SG&A again, I'm sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter last year. So our cost control measures continue to positively impact our results and are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the First Quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we move ahead. 
Now let's discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the First Quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of $154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0%. Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Products revenues were $477 million in the First Quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of $176 million, down 3.4% and that's 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4%. 
For the First Quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the First Quarter last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the Fourth Quarter and for the Full Year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-automotive businesses. We're intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.8 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was $8.8 million for the First Quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the Full Year. Our depreciation expense of $26 million for the quarter, we're now projecting for depreciation to remain at $120 million to $130 million for the Full Year. So combined depreciation and amortization of $34.7 million for the First Quarter, and we would expect this to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million for the Full Year. The Other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $24.4 million for the quarter compared to $25.1 million last year. For the Full Year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the First Quarter was approximately 36%, which is in line with the First Quarter last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project a 37% tax rate for the full year. Our net income for the quarter of $158 million compares to $161 million for last year and our EPS was $1.05, which is flat with last year. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of the balance sheet, which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was $205 million, which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from the $166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable at $2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase, although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at March 31 was $3 billion, up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down $67 million on a comparable basis, which excludes the reclassification of the $250 million in term debt from long term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of $700 million at March 31 is $194 million less than the $894 million in March of last year. Our debt includes two $250 million term notes as well as another $200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We want to also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 18%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we appear well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the Full Year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. 
We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as 3 additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of USD 70 million. And Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission, with combined annual revenues of $50 million. For the balance of 2016, we'll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on the investments. 
Turning to share repurchases. We have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $12 million in the First Quarter, which is down slightly from last year. For the year, however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. So you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the Board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. While slightly above our stated goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio, we're very comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So that concludes our financial update for the First Quarter of 2016. And in summary, we operated relatively in line with our expectations, which assumed fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our non-automotive businesses. We managed to offset some of these challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Tom."

So that's an overview of the financial and operating performance for the First Quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive Group turning in the best performance. The lack of revenue growth in the non-automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating leverage, unfortunately. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we feel that our folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth, and across all our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt-on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front, based upon what we see right now, we think that we'll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters. Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we feel that our previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the Full Year against the current 1.8% increase. We said industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to their 2.5% decrease for the First Quarter, office products down 1% to up 2% compared to a 2.8% decrease in the quarter, and electrical will be up 1% to 2% compared to their 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company, we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the 0.5% decrease through the First Quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate, and this will be up 2% to 4% over prior year. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Kathrine."

You've hit on one key point, and that is that generally speaking, there are many more opportunities in that $25 million to $150 million range. Secondly, our philosophy has been that any acquisition we do needs to be accretive and hit the minimum threshold within 3 years, and it seems that we can get to some of the back-office synergies more quickly and more easily in the $25 million to $150 million range than something well above that. And then the third thing is we've had a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread the investments, spread the risks, so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said, if we were to find, I think you used the word transformational, if we were to find something larger, we would be more than happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within 3 years; and we look for a 15% ROIC no later than the third year. But if we found something large that met that threshold, then we would absolutely have an interest in doing it.

And once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,718,000,000, which was down 0.5%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which is even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year. Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to our overall results. The impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way, in constant currency, sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged, primarily on our non-automotive businesses, and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact. 
In constant currency, our automotive business was up 4.4%, industrial was down 1.7%, office products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our automotive operations and the remaining 3 segments is quite pronounced, and Paul will cover the automotive segment in a few minutes. But first, I'll make a few comments on the non-automotive businesses, starting with industrial. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continue to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for 2 reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3%; and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was the smallest decrease that we've seen in several quarters. Additionally, our mid-month April results are modestly positive, and hopefully, this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead. 
However, it is important to point out that if we look at our performance by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first, we have 6 that are up and 6 that are down. On the positive side, in no order, are lumber and wood products, food products, ag and cement, chemicals and automotive. On the downside, we have oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing. Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but 5 are down. In our top 12 product categories, 6 are up and 6 are down. So as you can see, it's a real mixture, with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this, in our opinion, is reflective of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we'll face for a bit longer and we'll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions. 
Moving on to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. This group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our industrial business were headwinds for the electrical segment as well: Things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment; lower defense spending; lower copper pricing again in the quarter; which cost us just over 1% of sales growth; the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers; and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors, we think, will persist for a bit longer. But it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. You may recall that the electrical segment is our largest, representing about 40% of the total company revenue. fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30%, and it's interesting that fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but electrical was down mid-teens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments. 
And finally, a few comments on office products. As reported earlier, this segment was down 3% in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel being offset by high single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results, ending the quarter with a high single-digit increase, and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even, followed by a slight decline in office products and a low double-digit decrease in technology products. 
Putting it all together, while making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom, overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they're working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they continue to work on diversifying their business through new product additions and the opening of new sales channels, and we hope to report in the next call that we're able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts. So that's a quick overview of our non-automotive businesses. 
And at this point, we'll ask Paul to cover the automotive operations. Paul?"
275034,329405723,959773,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending March",1487,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31, our global automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total automotive growth which includes an approximate 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter and improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015. 
Turning to our international business, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. This group once again reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in their local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid-single-digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets. 
In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically, our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all outperformed in the quarter. On the other hand, the Central, the Eastern, Midwestern regions of the country all underperformed. We would attribute the warmer-than-average temperatures experienced across the northern states in February and March as having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country. And as we look at our winter-related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double-digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again, we believe warmer-than-normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business. 
So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6%. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January, with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. Again, we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in '15 to March in 2016. This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as our retail business. 
So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder, these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can result -- we can report the results we have seen thus far are outpacing our expectations. 
As previously announced, we are expanding our initial 20-store pilot -- which we tested in 2015 -- to include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results, and for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. When we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gives us a 2-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts, and in quarter 1, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single-digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our major account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare Centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000-plus AutoCare customers, as this business trended up mid- to high single digits. On the major account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And while it's early, we are working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group. Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digits with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we have seen in recent quarters. 
So earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business. So now let's take a look at a few of our other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter. Our brakes business was a highlight again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses. 
We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. Our underlying import parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts; a $25 million business we acquired this past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket. 
We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows our Asia Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia Pac team, and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million.
On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever-increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our automotive business. We are pleased to report today we'll be closing on May 1, our Atlanta, Georgia-based heavy-duty truck parts business. We'd like to welcome the team from Global Parts, Inc. Global operates 6 branches in 3 states and generates sales of approximately $20 million-plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for our automotive business both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Now turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 2% in January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015. January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the first quarter, which is down from $2.40 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year, and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we are pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. We want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts, and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. 
So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?"

We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial",1790,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7% compared to 29.8% last year. The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our industrial business. Excluding this factor, we're pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses. 
On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost-saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment. I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We're down 0.6% in automotive. We're up 0.2% in industrial. We're up 0.1% in office and we're down 1.25% in electrical. So talking about SG&A again, I'm sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter last year. So our cost control measures continue to positively impact our results and are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we move ahead. 
Now let's discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of $154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0%. Our industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Products revenues were $477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of $176 million, down 3.4% and that's 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4%. 
For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-automotive businesses. We're intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.8 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was $8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense of $26 million for the quarter, we're now projecting for depreciation to remain at $120 million to $130 million for the full year. So combined depreciation and amortization of $34.7 million for the first quarter, and we would expect this to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million for the full year. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $24.4 million for the quarter compared to $25.1 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, which is in line with the first quarter last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project a 37% tax rate for the full year. Our net income for the quarter of $158 million compares to $161 million for last year and our EPS was $1.05, which is flat with last year. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of the balance sheet, which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was $205 million, which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from the $166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable at $2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase, although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at March 31 was $3 billion, up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down $67 million on a comparable basis, which excludes the reclassification of the $250 million in term debt from long term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of $700 million at March 31 is $194 million less than the $894 million in March of last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We want to also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 18%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we appear well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. 
We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as 3 additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of USD 70 million. And Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission, with combined annual revenues of $50 million. For the balance of 2016, we'll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on the investments. 
Turning to share repurchases. We have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $12 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year. For the year, however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. So you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. While slightly above our stated goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio, we're very comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary, we operated relatively in line with our expectations, which assumed fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our non-automotive businesses. We managed to offset some of these challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Tom."

So that's an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive Group turning in the best performance. The lack of revenue growth in the non-automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating leverage, unfortunately. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we feel that our folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth, and across all our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt-on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front, based upon what we see right now, we think that we'll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters. Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we feel that our previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full year against the current 1.8% increase. We said industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to their 2.5% decrease for the first quarter, office products down 1% to up 2% compared to a 2.8% decrease in the quarter, and electrical will be up 1% to 2% compared to their 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company, we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the 0.5% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate, and this will be up 2% to 4% over prior year. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Kathrine."

If we think back to January of this year, currency exchange was an even heavier factor. We were down mid- to upper double digits in the exchange rates between the Canadian, Mexican and Australian rates. We did see some moderation -- some strengthening of the dollar in February and March, but at this point, for the quarter, it was still double-digit impact and we really don't have as clear a look at what we think is going to happen as we go forward. I think, perhaps, the best thing to say would be that for the whole company, we've guided to being up 1% to 2%. And perhaps, for the whole company, FX is going to be a headwind of 1.5% to 2% at this point. As far as the acquisitions, the only ones that we have included in our guidance are the ones that have been completed. So Paul covered a couple of them. Carol covered a few more. They're the only ones we've included, and our practice is not to include anything until we actually close on it.

You've hit on one key point, and that is that generally speaking, there are many more opportunities in that $25 million to $150 million range. Secondly, our philosophy has been that any acquisition we do needs to be accretive and hit the minimum threshold within 3 years, and it seems that we can get to some of the back-office synergies more quickly and more easily in the $25 million to $150 million range than something well above that. And then the third thing is we've had a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread the investments, spread the risks, so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said, if we were to find, I think you used the word transformational, if we were to find something larger, we would be more than happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within 3 years; and we look for a 15% ROIC no later than the third year. But if we found something large that met that threshold, then we would absolutely have an interest in doing it.

And once completed, we will look forward to answering any specific questions that you may have. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2016 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,718,000,000, which was down 0.5%. Net income was $158 million, which was down 1.9% and earnings per share were $1.05 this year, which is even with the $1.05 reported in the first quarter of last year. Once again this quarter, currency exchange was a headwind to our overall results. The impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies was 1.6% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share in earnings per share. Stated another way, in constant currency, sales were up 1.1% and EPS was up 1%. While a bit better than the reported results, we still find ourselves revenue challenged, primarily on our non-Automotive businesses, and this is clearly pointed out if we look at the results by segment without currency impact. 
In constant currency, our Automotive business was up 4.4%, Industrial was down 1.7%, Office Products was down 2.5% and Electrical was down 3.4%. So the difference between our Automotive operations and the remaining 3 segments is quite pronounced, and Paul will cover the Automotive segment in a few minutes. But first, I'll make a few comments on the non-Automotive businesses, starting with Industrial. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 2.5% on a reported basis and down 1.7% in constant currency. And although we continue to run decreases in this segment, we are just a bit encouraged by these results for 2 reasons. First, the first quarter of 2015 was our strongest quarter of the year at plus 3%; and secondly, our Q1 2016 decrease was the smallest decrease that we've seen in several quarters. Additionally, our mid-month April results are modestly positive, and hopefully, this is something that we can maintain as we move forward in the month and in the quarters ahead. 
However, it is important to point out that if we look at our performance by industry segment, by top customers, and by top product categories, it shows just how uneven and choppy our business continues to be. If we look at our top 12 industry segments, first, we have 6 that are up and 6 that are down. On the positive side, in no order, are lumber and wood products, food products, ag and cement, chemicals and automotive. On the downside, we have oil and gas, equipment and machinery, iron and steel and equipment rental and leasing. Our top 20 customers are actually up low single digit, with 15 of these customers running positive results thus far, but 5 are down. In our top 12 product categories, 6 are up and 6 are down. So as you can see, it's a real mixture, with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in other areas. And all of this, in our opinion, is reflective of the tepid state of the economy both domestically and globally. But this is the environment that we'll face for a bit longer and we'll try to offset this with a combination of specific market share initiatives and acquisitions. 
Moving on to EIS, our electrical distribution segment. This group ended the quarter down 3% and some of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business were headwinds for the Electrical segment as well: Things like the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment; lower defense spending; lower copper pricing again in the quarter; which cost us just over 1% of sales growth; the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers; and the overall sluggish economic climate. And these factors, we think, will persist for a bit longer. But it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. You may recall that the Electrical segment is our largest, representing about 40% of the total company revenue. Fabrication and wire and cable each represent about 30%, and it's interesting that fabrication and wire and cable both had positive results in the quarter, but Electrical was down mid-teens. So our challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business and our folks are working hard to turn this segment around while at the same time working to maintain the positive results in the fabrication and wire and cable segments. 
And finally, a few comments on Office Products. As reported earlier, this segment was down 3% in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel being offset by high single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facility breakroom supply category turned in the strongest results, ending the quarter with a high single-digit increase, and we continue to be pleased with our growth in this segment. The furniture category was even, followed by a slight decline in Office Products and a low double-digit decrease in technology products. 
Putting it all together, while making good progress in areas like facility and breakroom, overall end market conditions remain challenging for our Office Products team and they're working hard on share of wallet and market share initiatives across their product categories and their customer base. Additionally, they continue to work on diversifying their business through new product additions and the opening of new sales channels, and we hope to report in the next call that we're able to close on a strategic acquisition later this quarter that will further bolster their diversification efforts. So that's a quick overview of our non-Automotive businesses. 
And at this point, we'll ask Paul to cover the Automotive operations. Paul?"
275034,329405723,999352,"Genuine Parts Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March",1487,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to be with you today and to have the opportunity to provide you an update on the first quarter performance of our Automotive business. For the quarter ending March 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2% year-over-year. This performance consists of approximately 4.5% in total Automotive growth which includes an approximate 1% benefit from acquisitions. However, this was offset by a currency headwind of approximately 2.5% in the first quarter. Our U.S. team posted a 4% sales increase in the first quarter and improved performance from the 2% growth we reported in the fourth quarter and the 3% growth we experienced for the full year of 2015. 
Turning to our international business, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. This group once again reported another quarter of mid-single-digit growth in their local currencies. Despite challenging local economies, especially in Australia and Canada, we remain encouraged by the consistent mid-single-digit growth we are experiencing across all of these international markets. 
In the U.S., our results varied widely by geographical region and product category. Geographically, our business in the Florida, Atlantic and Western regions of the country all outperformed in the quarter. On the other hand, the Central, the Eastern, Midwestern regions of the country all underperformed. We would attribute the warmer-than-average temperatures experienced across the northern states in February and March as having a negative impact on our business in that region of the country. And as we look at our winter-related goods, we saw a similar trend in sales. After experiencing double-digit growth in January, our battery business was flat in both February and March. Again, we believe warmer-than-normal weather patterns impacted this segment of our business. 
So now let's turn to our same-store sales for the first quarter. Our U.S. company-owned store group grew same-store sales in the first quarter by 3.6%. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post solid results in January, with sales moderating somewhat in February and March. Again, we would attribute a good bit of this slowdown to the weather as well as the impact from Easter week moving from April in '15 to March in 2016. This quarter's 3.6% same-store sales increase compared to a plus 2% in the fourth quarter and was driven by a combination of increases on both our commercial wholesale side of the business as well as our retail business. 
So let's start with our retail results. As mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expand our DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group. As a reminder, these initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extending our store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. We are still early in the process, but we can result -- we can report the results we have seen thus far are outpacing our expectations. 
As previously announced, we are expanding our initial 20-store pilot -- which we tested in 2015 -- to include an additional 150 company-owned stores in 2016. These initiatives are having a positive impact on our results, and for the first quarter, we can report a total increase of 3% in our retail business. When we couple this 3% increase with the 6% increase we posted in the first quarter of 2015, it gives us a 2-year stack of plus 9%. Our retail initiatives are driving increased transaction accounts, and in quarter 1, we again saw a significant jump in the number of retail tickets. We can also report a low single-digit increase in our average basket size for the quarter. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our Automotive business posted a 4% increase in the first quarter, an improvement over the 2% increase we generated in the fourth quarter of 2015. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Account business as well as our NAPA AutoCare Centers. We had a strong quarter with our 16,000-plus AutoCare customers, as this business trended up mid- to high single digits. On the Major Account front, our team drove sales increases in line with our overall Automotive growth for the quarter. We were also encouraged by the slight improvement in our fleet business, which was up 2% for the quarter and an improvement over the 1% increase we posted in Q4 of 2015. And while it's early, we are working really hard to gain some positive momentum with this important customer group. Our average wholesale ticket value was up low single digits with no benefits from inflation. We were flat in the average number of tickets, although our first quarter performance was improved over a downward trend we have seen in recent quarters. 
So earlier in my comments, I mentioned our battery business. So now let's take a look at a few of our other product categories and review the trends we experienced in the first quarter. Our brakes business was a highlight again in the first quarter. This category grew low double digits in the quarter and we can also report solid growth in both our tool and equipment business as well as our filtration business. We are especially pleased to see the growth in our big filter business. This key product category came under pressure last year as our industrial, energy and our fleet business softened. We hope to continue this trend as the year progresses. 
We continue to be encouraged with the strong growth we are experiencing from our NAPA import parts business. Our underlying import parts business was up high single digits in the quarter before the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts; a $25 million business we acquired this past February. We can report good progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we will continue to search for additional acquisitions in this growing segment of the aftermarket. 
We would also like to update you on the closing of our Covs Parts acquisition on March 1. As you may recall, we announced in February that we received approval to acquire 21 of their 25 branches. This allows our Asia Pac business to further expand its market presence and scale in Western Australia. This is an important strategic acquisition for the Asia Pac team, and we expect Covs to generate additional annual revenues of approximately USD 70 million.
On the acquisition front, we are encouraged by the ever-increasing level of activity in all geographical regions and in all segments of our Automotive business. We are pleased to report today we'll be closing on May 1, our Atlanta, Georgia-based heavy-duty truck parts business. We'd like to welcome the team from Global Parts, Inc. Global operates 6 branches in 3 states and generates sales of approximately $20 million-plus on an annualized basis. This business will serve as a nice complement to our growing business in this segment of the Automotive aftermarket. And as we look ahead, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a growth lever for our Automotive business both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Now turning to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 2% in January following a strong 3.5% increase in 2015. January marks 23 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gas was $2 in the first quarter, which is down from $2.40 per gallon in 2015, the second cheapest annual average in the past 10 years. And although gas prices appear to be moving upward in recent weeks in most parts of the U.S., the current cost of gasoline remains well below last year, and these low gas prices should bode well for future increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
In closing, we are pleased to show positive sales growth in the first quarter and look forward to building on our growth plans over the balance of the year. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing on our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. We want to thank our teams both in North America as well as Australasia for their efforts, and appreciate all they do for the GPC Automotive business. 
So that completes our overview of the GPC Automotive business. And at this time, I'll hand the call over to Carol to get us started with a review of our financial results. Carol?"

We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial",1790,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning. We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning and we'll get started with looking at our first quarter income statement and segment information and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
Our total revenues of $3.7 billion for the first quarter were down 0.5% or up 1% excluding the impact of FX. Our gross profit for the first quarter was 29.7% compared to 29.8% last year. The slight change in gross profit margin primarily reflects the continued pressure of lower supplier incentives earned in our Industrial business. Excluding this factor, we're pleased with the positive impact of our gross margin initiatives across all of our businesses. 
On SG&A, the impact of SG&A in the quarter was flat and we had some impact from our cost-saving initiatives and just the loss of leverage. So our efforts to enhance gross margin are especially important in our low inflationary environment. I want to mention what our cumulative supplier price changes are for 2015. We're down 0.6% in Automotive. We're up 0.2% in Industrial. We're up 0.1% in office and we're down 1.25% in Electrical. So talking about SG&A again, I'm sorry about that, our SG&A was $850 million or 23.07% of sales, which is in line with first quarter last year. So our cost control measures continue to positively impact our results and are driving our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. For the first quarter, however, the benefits of our overall cost savings were somewhat offset by the deleveraging of our expenses in our non-Automotive businesses. As we look ahead, our teams remain committed to controlling our expenses and enhancing our productivity and streamlining our operations. We expect to show continued progress on these initiatives as we move ahead. 
Now let's discuss our results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $1.9 billion or up 2% from the prior year and 52% of our total sales. Our operating profit of $154 million is up 2% and their margin improved 10 basis points to 8.0%. Our Industrial sales were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a 2.5% decrease from the prior year and 31% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $82 million is down 6.8% and our operating margin was down 30 basis points to 7.1%, primarily driven by lower supplier incentives as well as expense deleverage. Our Office Products revenues were $477 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% and representing 13% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $34 million is down 6.4% and our operating margin of 7.2% is down 20 basis points. The Electrical/Electronic Group had sales in the quarter of $176 million, down 3.4% and that's 4% of our total revenues. Their operating profit of $15 million is down 4% and the margin for this group was down 10 basis points to 8.4%. 
For the first quarter, our total operating profit margin was 7.7% compared to 7.8% in the first quarter last year. This follows a 10 basis point margin improvement in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015 and basically reflects the lack of leverage associated with the sales environment in our non-Automotive businesses. We're intensely focused on continued progress in this area with further margin expansion being a key goal for the company. 
We had net interest expense of $4.8 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we continue to look for net interest expense to be $21 million to $22 million. Our amortization expense was $8.8 million for the first quarter and we continue to expect total amortization expense to be $36 million to $38 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense of $26 million for the quarter, we're now projecting for depreciation to remain at $120 million to $130 million for the full year. So combined depreciation and amortization of $34.7 million for the first quarter, and we would expect this to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million for the full year. The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $24.4 million for the quarter compared to $25.1 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, which is in line with the first quarter last year. We expect this rate to increase over the balance of the year and continue to project a 37% tax rate for the full year. Our net income for the quarter of $158 million compares to $161 million for last year and our EPS was $1.05, which is flat with last year. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of the balance sheet, which we continue to further strengthen with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at March 31 was $205 million, which is in line with our cash position at year-end and up a bit from the $166 million at March 31 last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable at $2 billion at March 31 is flat with the prior year and relatively in line with our sales. We continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with their quality at this time. The inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, a 2% overall increase, although this is flat excluding the impact of acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Accounts payable at March 31 was $3 billion, up approximately 14% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payable initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and days in payables. Our working capital of $1.6 billion at March 31 is improved from the prior year and down $67 million on a comparable basis, which excludes the reclassification of the $250 million in term debt from long term to current. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable remains a high priority for our company. Our total debt of $700 million at March 31 is $194 million less than the $894 million in March of last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes as well as another $200 million in borrowings under our multicurrency credit facility. We want to also add that one of the term notes is due this November 30 and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 18%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe it provides the company both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities we may want to pursue. 
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we appear well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. 
We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, the reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 60 consecutive years. Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to our growth plans. Thus far in 2016, we've added the Olympus automotive import parts business as well as 3 additional acquisitions which closed on March 1. As previously covered by Tom and Paul, our Asia Pac business also acquired Covs Parts with expected annual revenues of USD 70 million. And Motion added Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission, with combined annual revenues of $50 million. For the balance of 2016, we'll continue to seek acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. Although many of these opportunities will continue to be bolt-on type companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on the investments. 
Turning to share repurchases. We have purchased 576,000 shares thus far in 2016 and we have 5.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best returns to our shareholders. Our investment in capital expenditures was $12 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year. For the year, however, we continue to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. So you will see CapEx picking up over the balance of the year due primarily to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend of $2.63 per share approved by the board in February was a 7% increase from the prior year and is approximately 57% of our 2015 earnings. While slightly above our stated goal of a 50% to 55% payout ratio, we're very comfortable going beyond this range from time to time due to our strong cash flows. 
So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2016. And in summary, we operated relatively in line with our expectations, which assumed fairly steady underlying growth for the Automotive business but another quarter of challenging economic conditions across our non-Automotive businesses. We managed to offset some of these challenges with key sales initiatives and cost controls and also further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. We look forward to updating you on our future progress in the period ahead. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Tom."

So that's an overview of the financial and operating performance for the first quarter. And in looking back, our feeling is that our teams did a reasonably good job of operating with the Automotive Group turning in the best performance. The lack of revenue growth in the non-Automotive businesses did not enable us to gain any operating leverage, unfortunately. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we feel that our folks did a pretty good job overall and we look for another strong year in cash generation and asset management. The one area that we continue to be challenged in is sales growth, and across all our businesses, organic growth initiatives and strategic bolt-on type acquisitions are getting a lot of attention. And on the acquisition front, based upon what we see right now, we think that we'll have a bit more to talk about in the second and third quarters. Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we feel that our previously provided guidance remains appropriate at this time. You may recall that we guided for Automotive revenues to be up 2% to 3% for the full year against the current 1.8% increase. We said Industrial would be up 1% to 2% compared to their 2.5% decrease for the first quarter, Office Products down 1% to up 2% compared to a 2.8% decrease in the quarter, and Electrical will be up 1% to 2% compared to their 3.4% decrease in Q1. So for the total company, we feel that 1% to 2% increase is appropriate compared to the 0.5% decrease through the first quarter. And then on the earnings side, we feel that an expectation of $4.70 to $4.80 per share remains appropriate, and this will be up 2% to 4% over prior year. 
At this point, we'd like to address your questions and we'll turn the call back to Kathrine."

If we think back to January of this year, currency exchange was an even heavier factor. We were down mid- to upper double digits in the exchange rates between the Canadian, Mexican and Australian rates. We did see some moderation -- some strengthening of the dollar in February and March, but at this point, for the quarter, it was still double-digit impact and we really don't have as clear a look at what we think is going to happen as we go forward. I think, perhaps, the best thing to say would be that for the whole company, we've guided to being up 1% to 2%. And perhaps, for the whole company, FX is going to be a headwind of 1.5% to 2% at this point. As far as the acquisitions, the only ones that we have included in our guidance are the ones that have been completed. So Paul covered a couple of them. Carol covered a few more. They're the only ones we've included, and our practice is not to include anything until we actually close on it.

You've hit on one key point, and that is that generally speaking, there are many more opportunities in that $25 million to $150 million range. Secondly, our philosophy has been that any acquisition we do needs to be accretive and hit the minimum threshold within 3 years, and it seems that we can get to some of the back-office synergies more quickly and more easily in the $25 million to $150 million range than something well above that. And then the third thing is we've had a general approach that we want to make multiple acquisitions across each of our businesses and spread the investments, spread the risks, so to speak, but also to leverage the strong management teams that we have across our businesses. Now with all of that said, if we were to find, I think you used the word transformational, if we were to find something larger, we would be more than happy to look at it, but it has to meet the same general level of expectation within 3 years; and we look for a 15% ROIC no later than the third year. But if we found something large that met that threshold, then we would absolutely have an interest in doing it. The good point is that we have the balance sheet that will enable us to do whatever, and it was that kind of logic that led us to GPC Asia Pacific, the largest acquisition we've ever done and one that has turned out to be pretty darn good, we think, for the shareholders of Genuine Parts."

That's rotors and friction and calipers, have all been outpacing or overall growth. And I think it's just a great job by our team in the -- out in the field grabbing some market share, and we got a great partner on that side. If you recall, Brian, a year ago on the chassis side, we were having some significant service issues and pleased to report those are now behind us. And we're seeing that business return back to more normal growth rates, but we were down quite a bit early last year as a result of some of the service problems. So again, that's a business we ought to do quite well throughout the first half of the year."

As you know, Paul Donahue was named Chief Executive Officer on May 1, and Paul is only the fifth Chief Executive in our 88-year history, certainly indicative of the management stability within our organization.

I'm both honored and humbled to follow you as CEO of this great company. You've had an admirable 46-year career at GPC, and the performance of the company under your leadership for the last 12 years has been impressive. That said, working closely with you for the last 9 years has been invaluable, and I feel well prepared for this new role, and importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as Chairman. 
GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady consistent growth and sound financials and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segments, and I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses. As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more detail later on the call to this point. 
Now turning to our second quarter. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. 
A quick recap of our second quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%. Net income was $191.4 million, down 2%, and earnings per share were $1.28, in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions right across our Automotive, Industrial and office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currencies impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share EPS. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7% and included an approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by a currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and we expect to show more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives. 
Our U.S. results varied widely by geographical region, with our better-performing markets in the Western, Southern and Mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and the Eastern regions for the mild winter temperatures, and this is evident of failed transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling and right [ph] control products which were weak for most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report, however, that our batteries and air-conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures with both up double digits. In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer business. 
Same store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April slightly bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter followed by a low to mid-single digit decline in May and flat results in June, so a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month. 
Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter. Our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe, however, that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. Furthermore, we continue to expand on the retail impact initiative which was initially piloted in 20 stores in 2015 with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction accounts were down low-single digits while our average basket size was up low single digits. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Accounts business and our NAPA AutoCare centers, and the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter. On the Major Accounts front, sales were down low single digits, which we believe reflect the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales for our AutoCare centers were up low single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was down slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation and we are flat in the average number of tickets. 
Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S. We continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February, we have positive momentum in this category as we enter the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import part acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call. 
Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Local parts operates 6 branches in 3 states and with expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million and serves as a nice complement for our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain. After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks  26 consecutive months of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. 
The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core automotive business is performing well and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia. Likewise, we are excited by doing the first acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket motorcycle accessories and parts with 4 stores and approximate annual revenues of USD 12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business which further expands our growing product offering into the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past 3 years. 
And now for Canada, we continue produce low to single mid -- low to mid-single digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada and, of course, the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May. On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in equipment automotive parts for the European vehicles and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately USD 50 million in annual revenue and, much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expect our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico. 
So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging to our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down approximately 2% which compares to a 2.5% decrease in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions in currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the Industrial production and capacity utilization. 
With that said a, quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, 3 generated sales increases, 7 were down and 2 were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased sales while 5 were down, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw 6 that increased and 6 that were down, also consistent with the first quarter. 
So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results and others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015 and, as mentioned before, believe we're seeing at least some early signs of a stabilized and industrial economy. This will certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead. 
Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year. We will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close on AGCO [ph] a regional industrial safety product distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS. Sales for this group were down 5% and remains challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business, things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter, which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers and just the overall sluggish economic climate. You're expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group type revenues and sales were down low double digits. Fabrication was down low single digits, and our wire and cable business was up low single digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business. So certainly, there is proven across the EIS segments but the greater sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the Electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter which was driven a 5% contribution from acquisition. Sales for the Safety Zone, acquired on June 1, represents the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well. By customer group our mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel was partially offset by mid-single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category or FBS performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single digits. Furniture was down mix single digits and technology products were down low double digits. We continue to make solid progress with our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. 
As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contributed approximately $20 million in annual revenues. Our Office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our broad strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year. 
So that is an overview of our performance of our business, and we want to thank our teams across all of our business fors their efforts the in and day out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC a great company that it is. So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our #1 priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pool it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal. 
The 4 building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following: the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide the financial update and full year guidance. Carol?"

It is certainly well deserved, and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years. 
We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items. Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced growth margin for the long term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 6 months in 2016 were Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year primarily due to the lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures, which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. 
Now if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter at $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year. Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6%, which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement and ongoing cost reduction. Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenue. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year. For the Electrical group our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% from the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points. 
So for the second quarter our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of $20 million to $21 million. Our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million. Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter, and for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable nontaxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year. We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable is $2 billion at June 30 was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 million [ph] which is actually down to 3% when you receive the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion [ph], up 12% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter-to-quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, remain a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt of $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year, and this includes 2, $250 million term notes as well as another $275 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. [indiscernible] that provides a company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we remain well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year and our free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe served to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Our strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for our us and are integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial and Office operations. These are a excellent strategic fit for us, and collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues. Looking forward, we will continue to take additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes large or small assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We purchased 765 million shares -- 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the 6 months. Today, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set time for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return for our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th [ph] consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter of 2016, and in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international Automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins and tight expense cost controls. In addition, we further improve the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. 
Now turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%. We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from our previous plus 1% to plus 2%, and we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from a previous up 1% to up 2%.

We have for the 6 months a slight decrease in the volume incentive but they were flat in the quarter.

I'm both honored and humbled to follow you as CEO of this great company. You've had an admirable 46-year career at GPC, and the performance of the country -- of the company under your leadership for the last 12 years has been impressive. That said, working closely with you for the last 9 years has been invaluable and I feel well prepared for this new role. And importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as Chairman. 
GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady consistent growth and sound financials, and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segments, and I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses. As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more detail later on the call to this point. 
Now turning to our second quarter. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. 
A quick recap of our second quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%; net income was $191.4 million, down 2%; and earnings per share were $1.28, in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions right across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currency impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share EPS. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7% and included an approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by a currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and would expect to show more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives. 
Our U.S. results varied widely by geographical region, with our better-performing markets in the Western, Southern and Mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and the Eastern regions for the mild winter temperatures. And this is evident in the sales transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling and ride control products, which were weak during most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report, however, that our batteries and air-conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures with both up double digits. In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer business. 
Same-store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April slightly bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter, followed by a low to mid-single digit decline in May and flat results in June. So a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month. 
Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter. Our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe, however, that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. Furthermore, we continue to expand on a retail impact initiative, which was initially piloted in 20 stores in 2015, with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction accounts were down low-single digits while our average basket size was up low single digits. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter, which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Accounts business and our NAPA AutoCare centers. And the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter. On the Major Accounts front, sales were down low single digits, which we believe reflect the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales for our AutoCare centers were up low single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation and we are flat in the average number of tickets. 
Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S. We continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February, we have positive momentum in this category as we enter the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import parts acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call. 
Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Local parts operates 6 branches in 3 states. And with expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million, it serves as a nice complement for our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain. After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks the 26th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. 
The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core automotive business is performing well and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia. Likewise, we are excited by the June first acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket motorcycle accessories and parts with 4 stores and approximate annual revenues of USD 12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business, which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations, resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past 3 years. 
And now for Canada, we continue to produce low to single mid -- low to mid-single digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada and, of course, the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May. On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in original equipment automotive parts for European vehicles and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately USD 50 million in annual revenue and much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico. 
So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging for our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down approximately 2%, which compares to a 2.5% decrease in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions in currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized, which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the Industrial production and capacity utilization. 
With that said, a quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, 3 generated sales increases, 7 were down and 2 were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased our-- increased  sales while 5 were down, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw 6 that increased and 6 that were down, also consistent with the first quarter. 
So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015 and, as mentioned before, believe we're seeing at least some early signs of a stabilizing industrial economy. This will certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead. 
Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year. We will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close an opco, regional industrial safety product distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS. Sales for this group were down 5% and remains challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business, things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter, which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers and just the overall sluggish economic climate. We are expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performances of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group's revenues, and sales were down low double digits. Fabrication was down low single digits, and our wire and cable business was up low single digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business. So certainly, there is room for improvement across the EIS segments, but our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter, which was driven a 5% contribution from acquisitions. Sales for The Safety Zone, acquired on June 1, represents the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well. By customer group our mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category or FBS performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single digits. Furniture was down mid-single digits and technology products were down low double digits. We continue to make solid progress with our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. 
As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contribute approximately $20 million in annual revenues. Our office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business and we want to thank our teams across all of our business for their efforts day in and day out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC the great company that it is. So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our #1 priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pool it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal. 
The 4 building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following: the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide the financial update and a full year guidance. Carol?"

It is certainly well deserved, and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years. 
We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items. Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced growth margin for the long term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 6 months in 2016 where Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year primarily due to the lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures, which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. 
Now if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter at $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year. Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6%, which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement and ongoing cost reductions. Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenue. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year. For the Electrical group, our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% from the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points. 
So for the second quarter our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage, as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter. And for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of $20 million to $21 million. Our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter, and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million. Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter. And for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The Other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable nontaxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year. We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year, but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable is $2 billion at June 30, was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, which is actually down to 3% when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter-to-quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, remain a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt of $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year. And this includes 2, $250 million term notes as well as another $275 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows. And following a record year in 2015, we remain well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year and our free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Our strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial and Office operations. These are  excellent strategic fit for us. And collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues. Looking forward, we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We purchased 765 million shares -- 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the 6 months. To date, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return for our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter of 2016. And in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were also-- were  impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international Automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins and tight expense cost controls. In addition, we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. 
Now turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%. We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from a previous plus 1% to plus 2%. And we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from a previous up 1% to up 2%. This sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through July 1 as well as the opco industrial acquisition that Paul mentioned earlier. On the earnings side, we are updating our earnings guidance to be $4.70 to $4.75 from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and we will just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of GPC. Paul, I'll turn it back over to you."

And those things have been put in place and have helped their gross profit. We had for the 6 months a slight decrease in the volume incentive, but they were flat in the quarter. And additionally, on the SG&A side, they've adjusted their cost structure to be more in line with the revenues. So it's a combination of those things.

So we believe that, that tech headwind will become less and less of a factor as we move forward."

And importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as Chairman. 
GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady, consistent growth and sound financials, and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segments, and I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses. As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more detail later on the call to this point. 
Now turning to our second quarter. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. 
A quick recap of our second quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%; net income was $191.4 million, down 2%; and earnings per share were $1.28, in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currency impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share EPS. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7% and included an approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by a currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and would expect to show more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives. 
Our U.S. results varied widely by geographical region, with our better-performing markets in the Western, Southern and Mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and the Eastern regions to the mild winter temperatures. And this is evident in the sales transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling and ride control products, which were weak during most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report, however, that our batteries and air-conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures with both up double digits. In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer business. 
Same-store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April slightly bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter, followed by a low to mid-single digit decline in May and flat results in June. So a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month. 
Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter. Our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe, however, that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. Furthermore, we continue to expand on a retail impact initiative, which was initially piloted at 20 stores in 2015, with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction accounts were down low-single digits while our average basket size was up low single digits. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter, which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Accounts business and our NAPA AutoCare centers. And the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter. On the Major Accounts front, sales were down low single digits, which we believe reflect the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales for our AutoCare centers were up low single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation and we are flat in the average number of tickets. 
Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S. We continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February, we have positive momentum in this category as we enter the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import parts acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call. 
Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Global Parts operates 6 branches in 3 states. And with expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million, it serves as a nice complement to our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks the 26th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. 
The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core automotive business is performing well and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia. Likewise, we are excited by the June 1 acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket motorcycle accessories and parts with 4 stores and approximate annual revenues of USD 12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business, which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations, resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past 3 years. 
And now for Canada, we continue to produce low to single mid -- low to mid-single digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada and, of course, the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May. On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in original equipment automotive parts for European vehicles and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately USD 50 million in annual revenues and much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico. 
So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging for our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operation. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down approximately 2%, which compares to a 2.5% decrease in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions in currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized, which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the Industrial production and capacity utilization. 
With that said, a quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, 3 generated sales increases, 7 were down and 2 were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased our -- increased sales while 5 were down, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw 6 that increased and 6 that were down, also consistent with the first quarter. 
So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015 and, as mentioned before, believe we're seeing at least some early signs of a stabilizing industrial economy. This would certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead. 
Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year. We will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close on opco, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS. Sales for this group were down 5% and remain challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business, things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter, which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers and just the overall sluggish economic climate. We are expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performance of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group's revenues, and sales were down low double digits. Fabrication was down low single digits, and our wire and cable business was up low single digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business. So certainly, there is room for improvement across the EIS segments, but our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter, which was driven by a 5% contribution from acquisitions. Sales for The Safety Zone, acquired on June 1, represent the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well. By customer group our mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category or FBS performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single digits. Furniture was down mid-single digits and technology products were down low double digits. We continue to make solid progress with our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. 
As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contribute approximately $20 million in annual revenues. Our office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business and we want to thank our teams across all of our business for their efforts day in and day out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC the great company that it is. So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our #1 priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pull it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal. 
The 4 building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following: the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive a greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and a full year guidance. Carol?"

It is certainly well deserved, and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies.

It is certainly well deserved, and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years. 
We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items. Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced growth margin for the long term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 6 months in 2016 were Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year primarily due to the lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures, which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. 
Now if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter of $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year. Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6%, which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement and ongoing cost reductions. Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenue. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year. For the Electrical group, our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% from the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points. 
So for the second quarter our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage, as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter. And for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of $20 million to $21 million, our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter, and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million. Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter. And for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The Other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable nontaxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year. We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year, but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable is $2 billion at June 30, was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, which is actually down 3% when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter-to-quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, remain a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt of $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year. And this includes 2, $250 million term notes as well as another $275 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows. And following a record year in 2015, we remain well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year and our free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Our strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial and Office operations. These are excellent strategic fits for us. And collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues. Looking forward, we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We purchased 765 million shares -- 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the 6 months. To date, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter of 2016. And in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were also-- were impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international Automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins and tight expense cost controls. In addition, we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. 
Now turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%. We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from a previous plus 1% to plus 2%. And we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from a previous up 1% to up 2%. This sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through July 1 as well as the opco industrial acquisition that Paul mentioned earlier. On the earnings side, we are updating our earnings guidance to be $4.70 to $4.75 from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and we would just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of GPC. Paul, I'll turn it back over to you."

We've said that each business, a lot of our investments are in technology and productivity. So as we can put in some of these efficiencies, we would be improving our volume per employee. So it's certainly looking at efficiencies and distribution centers. Also, you're just adjusting your cost structure to a different level of revenue. So on the Industrial side and looking at some of their facilities and looking at their operations and making adjustments, to say, well, we're not going to have business in certain areas and possibly we need to go from 3 branches to 2 branches and -- so I think it's a number of projects going on. Our Automotive folks have done a very good job on SG&A. And even with a little softer Q2, they still had some SG&A improvement. So we would expect this to continue. We need to have a little bit better second half, which we're forecasting on the revenue, and -- but we would expect these things to stay in place, yes."

And if I remember right, it was a function of uncompetitive pricing in a couple of categories. In fact, it may have even been ride control, now that I think about it. So any change overall in the competitive environment and then also specifically on your pricing relative to the market?"

I think pricing remains sane across all of our competitors. Look, everybody is scratching and clawing for market share in a challenging environment, but we've not seen any major shift across our key competitors. As it relates to our pricing by product or pricing by product category, I recall quite well your reference to '08 and '09, and that did occur and we did adjust and I think we certainly benefited from it. We don't see anywhere at this point where we're an outlier in a particular product category. Our guys do price shops on a very regular basis. We get input from the field on a daily, weekly basis both from our stores as well as our independent owners, and there is always the occasional tweak we make here and there based on the competitive landscape. But no, I would say, generally, we are not seeing any significant change in the competitive landscape."

I'm both honored and humbled to follow you as CEO of this great company. You've had an admirable 46-year career at GPC, and the performance of the country -- of the company under your leadership for the last 12 years has been impressive. That said, working closely with you for the last 9 years has been invaluable and I feel well prepared for this new role. And importantly, the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance. So thank you, and I look forward to working with you in your role as Chairman. 
GPC has a long and rich 88-year history of steady, consistent growth and sound financials, and has been an effective steward of capital. Under my leadership, we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come. In my first 75 days as CEO, I've taken considerable time to visit with our operations, both around the globe and across our business segments, and I'm more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses. As this quarter would indicate, we have our share of challenges to overcome, but I also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters. This is our most critical near-term objective and I'm committed to making this happen. We will provide more detail later on the call to this point. 
Now turning to our second quarter. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. 
A quick recap of our second quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.9 billion, which was down 1%; net income was $191.4 million, down 2%; and earnings per share were $1.28, in line with the second quarter of last year. Total sales in the quarter included a 2% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you'll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results. Currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Mexican currency impacting our results by approximately 1% on the revenue line and $0.01 per share EPS. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ended June 30, our global Automotive sales were down 0.7% and included an approximate 2% benefit from acquisitions, offset by a currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Our U.S. results were down 2% in the quarter which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring. While we are not pleased with this deceleration, we would point out that our second quarter sales in 2012, the last year we had similar mild winter patterns, we were also down 600 basis points from the first quarter. So we have seen this pattern before and would expect to show more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives. 
Our U.S. results varied widely by geographical region, with our better-performing markets in the Western, Southern and Mountain regions of the country. The Central, Eastern and Southwest regions of the country all underperformed. Again, we would attribute the soft results in the Central and the Eastern regions to the mild winter temperatures. And this is evident in the sales transfer of weather-related goods such as batteries, heating and cooling and ride control products, which were weak during most of the second quarter. We are pleased to report, however, that our batteries and air-conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot June temperatures with both up double digits. In the Southwest, we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer business. 
Same-store sales for our U.S. company-owned store group were flat in the second quarter, and this compares to a 3.6% increase in the first quarter. The cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low single-digit increase in April slightly bolstered by the shift in the timing of Easter, followed by a low to mid-single-digit decline in May and flat results in June. So a mixed cadence with the month of May being our most challenging month. 
Taking a deeper look into our same-store sales for the quarter. Our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail DIY business, driving the overall flat same-store sales results. Despite the ongoing DIY initiatives across our company-owned store group, fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our company-owned retail sales. We believe, however, that the current market conditions will prove to be short-lived, and we remain confident in the long-term positive benefits of our retail initiatives. As a reminder, these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics, extended store hours, increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our NAPA rewards program, to name just a few. Furthermore, we continue to expand on a retail impact initiative, which was initially piloted at 20 stores in 2015, with plans to implement this concept in 150 company-owned stores in 2016. We are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores, with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business. For the second quarter, our retail transaction accounts were down low-single digits while our average basket size was up low single digits. 
Moving along to our core commercial wholesale business. This segment of our automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter, which compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter. The core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center around our Major Accounts business and our NAPA AutoCare centers. And the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter. On the Major Accounts front, sales were down low single digits, which we believe reflect the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing. Sales for our AutoCare centers were up low single digits, driven by the ongoing increase in memberships now totaling over 16,400 members strong. As an additional point of reference, our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter. Our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation and we are flat in the average number of tickets. 
Turning now to our import parts business in the U.S. We continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business. And with the added benefit of Olympus Import Parts, a $25 million business acquired this past February, we have positive momentum in this category as we enter the second half of the year. We continue to make solid progress with the integration of the Olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall. Given the positive attributes of this product offering, we closed on another import parts acquisition in Canada on July 1, which we'll cover a little bit later in the call. 
Also on the acquisition front, we are pleased to report that we closed on an Atlanta-based heavy-duty truck parts business on May 1. Global Parts operates 6 branches in 3 states. And with expected annual revenues of approximately $20 million, it serves as a nice complement to our growing business in the heavy-duty segment of the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. Automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11 years. The size of the fleet continues to grow. Lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. After strong growth of 3.5% in 2015, miles driven increased 2.6% in April, the most recent data available, and is up 3.7% year-to-date. April marks the 26th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. 
The national average price of gasoline was $2.35 in the second quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and, ultimately, driving additional parts purchases. 
Before closing out our Automotive review, we want to update you on our international businesses, which includes Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, our core automotive business is performing well and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs acquisition and its 21 branches in Western Australia. Likewise, we are excited by the June 1 acquisition of AMX, a Melbourne-based retailer of aftermarket motorcycle accessories and parts with 4 stores and approximate annual revenues of USD 12 million. Our team in Australia has a multi-year growth plan for this business, which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has now grown to 527 locations, resulting in net new store growth of nearly 100 locations over the past 3 years. 
And now for Canada, we continue to produce low to single mid -- low to mid-single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada and, of course, the devastating wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta back in May. On July 1, we closed on the acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in Canada. Auto-Camping, with 20 locations across Canada, specializes in original equipment automotive parts for European vehicles and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers. This business should generate approximately USD 50 million in annual revenues and much like the Olympus acquisition in the U.S., complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in Canada. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We have 21 NAPA stores in Mexico today and have plans for additional store growth in the future. We are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico. 
So in summary, the second quarter proved challenging for our U.S. Automotive business, although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operation. We believe the weakness in our U.S. sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring, and we expect to improve on this quarter's performance as we move ahead. Our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
Let's turn now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down approximately 2%, which compares to a 2.5% decrease in the first quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions in currency, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 3%, basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter. So for the second quarter overall, our Industrial business seems to have stabilized, which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the Industrial production and capacity utilization. 
With that said, a quick review of our business by industry segment, by top customers and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy. Among our top 12 industry segments, 3 generated sales increases, 7 were down and 2 were essentially flat. Looking at our top 20 customers, 15 of them increased our -- increased sales while 5 were down, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And among our top 12 product categories, we saw 6 that increased and 6 that were down, also consistent with the first quarter. 
So the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results in others. We have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of 2015 and, as mentioned before, believe we're seeing at least some early signs of a stabilizing industrial economy. This would certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead. 
Shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year. We will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth. We remain active with strategic bolt-on acquisitions for this business and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year. We can tell you that effective August 1, we will close on opco, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
Moving on now to our Electrical business, EIS. Sales for this group were down 5% and remain challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our Industrial business, things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment, lower defense spending, lower copper pricing again in the quarter, which cost us 1% of sales growth, the impact of the stronger dollar on our export-oriented customers and just the overall sluggish economic climate. We are expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year, but it's interesting to look at the individual performance of the 3 segments that comprise EIS. The Electrical segment is our largest, representing 40% of this group's revenues, and sales were down low double digits. Fabrication was down low single digits, and our wire and cable business was up low single digits with each representing another 30% of the EIS business. So certainly, there is room for improvement across the EIS segments, but our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business. Looking ahead, our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business which reported a 1% increase in sales for the second quarter, which was driven by a 5% contribution from acquisitions. Sales for The Safety Zone, acquired on June 1, represent the majority of our acquisition revenues for the Office business, and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well. By customer group our mid-single-digit growth in the Mega Channel was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline with our independent resellers. On the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category or FBS performed very well in the quarter, while the Office Products segment category was down low single digits. Furniture was down mid-single digits and technology products were down low double digits. We continue to make solid progress with our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. 
As previously announced, we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from Rochester Midland Corporation effective July 1. We expect this business to further enhance our FBS product offering and contribute approximately $20 million in annual revenues. Our office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolt-on acquisitions as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business and we want to thank our teams across all of our business for their efforts day in and day out. We appreciate all that they do to make GPC the great company that it is. So at this point, I'd also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our #1 priority. During this call, we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth. And I thought it might be helpful to pull it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal. 
The 4 building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following: the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive a greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion; the building out of our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and the further expansion of our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at Genuine Parts Company. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and a full year guidance. Carol?"

It is certainly well deserved, and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies.

It is certainly well deserved, and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies. And Tom, I would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and, on a more personal level, your guidance and counsel over the years. 
We will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information, and then we'll finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items. Our total revenues of $3.9 billion for the second quarter were down 1%. Our gross profit for the second quarter was 29.9%, which was equal to the prior year. Our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced growth margin for the long term. The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 6 months in 2016 were Automotive down 0.7%, Industrial up 0.2%, Office up 0.2% and Electrical down 1.3%. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the second quarter were $865 million or 22.2% of sales, which is up slightly from last year primarily due to the lower sales levels for the quarter. This was partially offset by our tight cost control measures, which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies. 
Now if we look at the results by segment, our Automotive revenue for the second quarter of $2.1 billion was down 1% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Our operating profit of $204 million is down 2% and the operating margin for this group is 9.7% compared to 9.9% in the second quarter last year. Our Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter were a decrease of 1.7% and 30% of our total revenues. Our operating profit of $88 million is down 0.7% and our operating margin is up 10 basis points to 7.6%, which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement and ongoing cost reductions. Office Products revenues were $482 million in the second quarter, up 1% and 12% of our total revenue. Our operating profit of $33 million is down 5% and our operating margin is 6.8% compared to 7.2% last year. For the Electrical group, our sales were $185 million in the quarter, down 5% from the prior year and also 5% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $16 million is down 14% and the margin for this group is 8.7% compared to 9.5% last year or down 80 basis points. 
So for the second quarter our total operating profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. This basically reflects the lack of leverage, as mentioned earlier. With that said, we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead. We had net interest expense of $4.7 million in the quarter. And for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of $20 million to $21 million, our total amortization expense of $9.2 million for the second quarter, and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be $36 million to $38 million. Our depreciation expense was $26.7 million for the quarter. And for the full year, we project total depreciation to approximate $110 million to $120 million. So our combined depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the second quarter, and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The Other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $26.5 million for the quarter compared to $24.8 million last year. For the full year, we still expect corporate expense to be in the $110 million to $120 million range. Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 36.2% compared to 37% in the second quarter last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable nontaxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year. We expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year, but we are projecting our full year rate to be 36.3% to 36.8%. Our net income for the quarter, as Paul mentioned, was $191.4 million compared to $195.4 million last year and our EPS of $1.28 was equal to last year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at June 30 was $234 million, up slightly from June of last year. Our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses. Accounts receivable is $2 billion at June 30, was up 1% from the prior year, and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.1 billion, which is actually down 3% when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. Our accounts payable at June 30 was $3.1 billion, up 12% from last year due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. We're encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables, and we would add that our AP to inventory ratio at June 30 reached 100% for the first time. Our working capital of $1.5 billion at June 30 continues to show steady improvement from quarter-to-quarter and is down nicely from the prior year. Effectively managing our working capital and, in particular, key items such as accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, remain a high priority for our company. 
Our total debt of $775 million at June 30 compares to $850 million in total debt last year. And this includes 2, $250 million term notes as well as another $275 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We would also add that one of our term notes is due November 30 of this year and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date. Our total debt to capitalization is approximately 19% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We believe that provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company. We continue to generate strong cash flows. And following a record year in 2015, we remain well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year and our free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. Our strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to our growth plans. Through July 1 of this year, we've added a number of new businesses across our Automotive, Industrial and Office operations. These are excellent strategic fits for us. And collectively, we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $450 million in annual revenues. Looking forward, we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we're also open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We purchased 765 million shares -- 765,000 shares in the second quarter and 1.3 million shares for the 6 months. To date, we have 4.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. While we have no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $38 million in the second quarter and is $50 million through June. For the year, we're currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million, so we expect CapEx to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects. 
Turning to our dividend. Our 2016 dividend is $2.63 per share or a 7% increase in the prior year dividend of $2.46. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
So that concludes our financial update for the second quarter of 2016. And in summary, our non-Automotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment. And in the second quarter, our U.S. Automotive sales were also-- were impacted by rather weak conditions. Fortunately, we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international Automotive operations. For the quarter, we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives, steady gross margins and tight expense cost controls. In addition, we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management. As we execute on our growth plans, progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. 
Now turning to our guidance for the full year. On the revenue side, we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus 1% to plus 2% for the full year. Among our business segments, we are maintaining our Automotive sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3% for the full year and we're increasing our Office guidance for sales to be plus 2% to plus 3% from the original amount of down 1% to up 1%. We are lowering our Industrial sales to flat to up 1% from a previous plus 1% to plus 2%. And we're reducing the Electrical sales outlook to down 2% to down 3% from a previous up 1% to up 2%. This sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through July 1 as well as the opco industrial acquisition that Paul mentioned earlier. On the earnings side, we are updating our earnings guidance to be $4.70 to $4.75 from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and we would just close by saying thank you to all of our GPC associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of GPC. Paul, I'll turn it back over to you."

And as you know, we have new distribution initiatives in place both in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I mentioned earlier, we've had terrific success in our GPC Asia Pac business, and that's a business we'll continue to grow. As we look at our digital capability, that goes across all 4 businesses.

There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance for those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts. 
From an operations perspective, we've had a number of facilities and stores closed and/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions. 
So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24 which is unchanged from last year's third quarter. 
Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead. 
Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. 
Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 7/10 [ph] decrease in the second quarter. This quarter's increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%. Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter, and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons. 
As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead. 
And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country. 
We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others. We do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business. We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future, the challenges we are facing today are, in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter's mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid-single-digit growth rates. 
Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year. DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases. And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of these initiatives. [ph] We are on plan to roll out this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017. 
The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid-single-digit declines at our major accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare centers were down slightly, although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today. This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available, and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well, with sales consistently up mid- to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year. Likewise, we are pleased to report that, on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, [ph] a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor, to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates the 15 benches with approximate annual revenues of USD 15 million. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past 3 years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead. 
At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OEM port -- parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately USD 50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June  30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico.
We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets. 
In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion. We look to improve on this quarter's performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts; executing our retail strategy; and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
So turning now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and, again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis. As a reminder, this quarter's results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017. The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the market begins to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing. 
A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with 3 sectors up, 7 down and 2 unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, 6 were up and 6 were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and 7 were down, which compares to 15 up and 5 down in the second quarter. 
So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year, and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest. The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets. 
Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities.
So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earning growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal. We're also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we'll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term.
To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This has improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions including Safety Zone are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category. Core sales for the office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the Mega Channel, which was down low single digits following mid-single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year. 
From the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. 
This quarter was difficult for us and -- as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead. Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market-share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full year guidance. Carol?"
275034,403418531,1056911,"Genuine Parts Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 bil",2203,"Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%. Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase for the -- from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by a favorable supplier incentive, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher-margin acquisitions. Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we've been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 9 months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses. In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we're able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on these synergies that we create with the combined businesses. We would also add that, with certain acquisitions, their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that's a factor in the current quarter. 
In the current sales environment, it's imperative that we [indiscernible] any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost-control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there's always a need for improvement. 
Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount- and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us. Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you'll see many more opportunities for further consolidations. 
Our ongoing investments in technology, which we've talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost in a highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses. 
Now we'll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales. 
Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% [ph] decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year. Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations. 
Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to 3 primary factors: the decrease in their organic sales; the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels; and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead. 
The Electrical group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead. 
So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we're intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. 
We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million. Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter, and we would expect the full year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. 
Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year. 
Now we'll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we've increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30, is up 3.5% from the prior year, and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time. 
Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it's actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. 
Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30. 
Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the company and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead. 
Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30 and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes and a new 5-year 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our 2 $250 million term notes is due this November and we've recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%. Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19% and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have. 
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend. 
Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us and are integral to the growth plans for our company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the 4 business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us, and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward. 
As we move forward, we'll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We've purchased 249,000 shares for the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the 9 months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment in capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full year. 
Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend is $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth. 
Now we'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we're updating our full year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we're lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%. We're reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a pervious flat to up 1%. We're reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%. This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our 9-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we're lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Paul at this time."

Before we go to questions, I just wanted to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call which are the 4 building blocks of our growth strategy. These are: one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that, over time, our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations. As [indiscernible], we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts. 
So in closing as we look ahead, we're excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism. We operate in 4 large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each. The outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive. The industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery. Our balance sheet continues -- our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy, our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years and, last, but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC Associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service. So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We've been operating now for 88-plus years and we've been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we'll make the necessary adjustments and we will emerge as the stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions."

And where we modeled, where we thought we would be second half of the year, we weren't quite there. We thought we would be. So we've got just -- it takes us longer to take those cost out and we're really adjusting to a lower level of core sales growth. And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly -- I mean we've made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in -- many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they're coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental cost when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out.

There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance for those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts. 
From an operations perspective, we've had a number of facilities and stores closed and/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions. 
So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24 which is unchanged from last year's third quarter. 
Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead. 
Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. 
Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 0.7% decrease in the second quarter. This quarter's increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%. Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter, and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons. 
As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead. 
And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country. 
We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others. We do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business. We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future, the challenges we are facing today are, in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter's mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid-single-digit growth rates. 
Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year. DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases. And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of this initiative. We are on plan to roll out this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017. 
The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid-single-digit declines at our major accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare centers were down slightly, although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today. This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available, and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well, with sales consistently up mid- to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year. Likewise, we are pleased to report that, on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor, to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates the 15 benches with approximate annual revenues of USD 15 million. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past 3 years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead. 
At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OEM port -- parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately USD 50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June  30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico.
We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets. 
In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion. We look to improve on this quarter's performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts; executing our retail strategy; and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
So turning now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and, again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis. As a reminder, this quarter's results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017. The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the market begins to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing. 
A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with 3 sectors up, 7 down and 2 unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, 6 were up and 6 were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and 7 were down, which compares to 15 up and 5 down in the second quarter. 
So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year, and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest. The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets. 
Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities.
So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earning growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal. We're also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we'll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term.
To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This has improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions including Safety Zone are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category. Core sales for the office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the Mega Channel, which was down low single digits following mid-single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year. 
From the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. 
This quarter was difficult for us and -- as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead. Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market-share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full year guidance. Carol?"
275034,403418531,1057005,"Genuine Parts Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 bil",2202,"Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%. Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase for the -- from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by a favorable supplier incentive, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher-margin acquisitions. Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we've been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 9 months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses. In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we're able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on these synergies that we create with the combined businesses. We would also add that, with certain acquisitions, their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that's a factor in the current quarter. 
In the current sales environment, it's imperative that we [indiscernible] any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost-control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there's always a need for improvement. 
Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount- and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us. Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you'll see many more opportunities for further consolidations. 
Our ongoing investments in technology, which we've talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost in a highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses. 
Now we'll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales. 
Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year. Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations. 
Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to 3 primary factors: the decrease in their organic sales; the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels; and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead. 
The Electrical group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead. 
So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we're intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. 
We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million. Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter, and we would expect the full year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. 
Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year. 
Now we'll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we've increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30, is up 3.5% from the prior year, and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time. 
Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it's actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. 
Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30. 
Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the company, and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead. 
Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30, and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes and a new 5-year, 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our 2 $250 million term notes is due this November, and we've recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%. Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have.
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. 
We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which, we believe, serve to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend.
Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to the growth plans for our company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the 4 business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us, and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward. 
As we move forward, we'll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We've purchased 249,000 shares in the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the 9 months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full year. 
Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend of $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth. 
Now we'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we're updating our full year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we're lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%. We're reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a previous flat to up 1%. We're reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%. This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our 9-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we're lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Paul at this time."

Before we go to questions, I just wanted to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call, which are the 4 building blocks of our growth strategy. These are: one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that, over time, our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. 
Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations. As we speak, we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts. 
So in closing, as we look ahead, we're excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism: We operate in 4 large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each; the outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive; the industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery; our balance sheet continues -- our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy; our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years; and last but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service. 
So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We've been operating now for 88-plus years and we've been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we'll make the necessary adjustments, and we will emerge as the stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions."

And where we modeled -- where we thought we would be second half of the year, we weren't quite there where we thought we would be. So we've got just -- it takes us longer to take those costs out, and we're really adjusting to a lower level of core sales growth. And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly -- I mean, we've made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in -- many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they're coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental costs when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out. So I think, all in all, the weak sales factor is the biggest thing that's impacting the SG&A. But I can tell you, our teams are working very, very hard right now to address all of our costs.

We appreciate you taking the time to be with us.

We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Before we begin our commentary on the quarter, we want to update you on Hurricane Matthew, a powerful and deadly storm which recently hit the coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas as well as the Caribbean. This storm inflicted damages in excess of $5 billion and impacted the lives and businesses of countless GPC personnel and our good customer partners. There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance to those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts. 
From an operations perspective, we've had a number of facilities and stores closed and/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions. 
So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24, which is unchanged from last year's third quarter. 
Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead. 
Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. 
Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 0.7% decrease in the second quarter. This quarter's increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%. Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter, and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons. 
As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead. 
And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country. 
We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others, but do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business. We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future, the challenges we are facing today are, in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter's mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid-single-digit growth rates. 
Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year. DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases. And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of these initiatives. We are on plan to roll out this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017. 
The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid-single-digit declines at our major accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare centers were down slightly. Although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today. This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available, and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well, with sales consistently up mid- to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year. Likewise, we are pleased to report that, on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates 15 branches with approximate annual revenues of USD 15 million. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past 3 years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead. 
At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OE import parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately USD 50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June  30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico.
We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets. 
In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion. We look to improve on this quarter's performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts; executing our retail strategy; and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
So turning now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and, again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis. As a reminder, this quarter's results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017. The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the markets begin to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing. 
A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with 3 sectors up, 7 down and 2 unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, 6 were up and 6 were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and 7 were down, which compares to 15 up and 5 down in the second quarter. 
So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year, and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest. The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets. 
Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities.
So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earnings growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal. We're also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we'll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term.
To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This has improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions, including Safety Zone, are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category. Core sales for the office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the Mega Channel, which was down low single digits following mid-single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year. 
on the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. 
This quarter was difficult for us as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead. Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market-share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full year guidance. Carol?"
275034,403418531,1057098,"Genuine Parts Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 bil",2202,"Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%. Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase for the -- from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by favorable supplier incentives, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher-margin acquisitions. Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we've been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 9 months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses. In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we're able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on the synergies that we create with the combined businesses. We would also add that with certain acquisitions their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that's a factor in the current quarter. 
In the current sales environment, it's imperative that we [indiscernible] any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost-control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there's always need for improvement. 
Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount- and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us. Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you'll see many more opportunities for further consolidation. 
Our ongoing investments in technology, which we've talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost in a highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses. 
Now we'll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales. 
Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year. Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations. 
Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to 3 primary factors: the decrease in their organic sales, the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead. 
The Electrical group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead. 
So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we're intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. 
We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million. Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter, and we would expect the full year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. 
Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year. 
Now we'll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we've increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30 is up 3.5% from the prior year and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time. 
Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it's actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. 
Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30. 
Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the company, and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead. 
Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30, and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes and a new 5-year, 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our 2 $250 million term notes is due this November, and we've recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%. Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have.
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. 
We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend.
Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to the growth plans for our company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the 4 business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us, and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward. 
As we move forward, we'll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We've purchased 249,000 shares in the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the 9 months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full year. 
Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend of $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth. 
Now we'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we're updating our full year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we're lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%. We're reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a previous flat to up 1%. We're reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%. This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our 9-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we're lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Paul at this time."

Before we go to questions, I just want to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call, which are the 4 building blocks of our growth strategy. These are: one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that, over time, our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. 
Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations. As we speak, we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts. 
So in closing, as we look ahead, we're excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism: we operate in 4 large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each; the outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive; the industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery; our balance sheet continues -- our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy; our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years; and last but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service. 
So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We've been operating now for 88-plus years and we've been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we'll make the necessary adjustments, and we will emerge as a stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions."

If you look at the indices that we follow, the ISM September numbers were positive, which rebounded from a negative number in August. So we're starting to see a bit of an uptick in our Industrial business as well."

And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly -- I mean, we've made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in -- many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they're coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental costs when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out. So I think, all in all, the weak sales factor is the biggest thing that's impacting the SG&A. But I can tell you, our teams are working very, very hard right now to address all of our costs. And we've done a lot of work on our headcount. We've done a lot of work on our facilities. And then when you see the improvements we've done, it just hasn't been enough to offset the decline in the core sales."

We appreciate you taking the time to be with us.

We appreciate you taking the time to be with us. Before we begin our commentary on the quarter, we want to update you on Hurricane Matthew, a powerful and deadly storm which recently hit the coast of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas as well as the Caribbean. This storm inflicted damages in excess of $5 billion and impacted the lives and businesses of countless GPC personnel and our good customer partners. There are many GPC associates, too many to call out today, who were mobilized around the clock before, during and after the storm, providing aid and assistance to those affected. We want to take this opportunity to publicly thank them for their selfless efforts. 
From an operations perspective, we've had a number of facilities and stores closed and/or without power for long periods of time. While most operations are now back up and running, we still have stores in the Carolinas struggling with power outages and floodwaters. So now the real work begins, and our team will continue to support the cleanup efforts and provide assistance wherever and whenever needed. 
Now earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2016 results. I'll make a few remarks on our overall results and then cover our performance by business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year. After that, we will open up the call to your questions. 
So a quick recap of our third quarter results shows sales for the quarter were $3.94 billion, which was up 0.5%. Net income was $185.3 million compared to $188 million last year, and earnings per share were $1.24, which is unchanged from last year's third quarter. 
Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. Despite the challenging sales environment, we had planned for improved results for the second half of the year, and we came up short in the third quarter. As we will discuss throughout this call, we are intensely focused on our action plans to drive sales and reduce costs in the quarters ahead. 
Total sales in the quarter included a 3.5% benefit from acquisitions spread across our Automotive, Industrial and Office businesses, and you will hear more on our successful acquisition strategy as we review our business results. 
Currency exchange was neutral to our overall results for the first time in a number of quarters with the slightly favorable Canadian and Australian currencies offsetting the ongoing weakness in the Mexican peso. 
Turning to our Automotive operations. For the quarter ending September 30, our global Automotive sales were up 1.5%, which has improved from the 0.7% decrease in the second quarter. This quarter's increase includes an approximate 2.5% benefit from acquisitions and a currency tailwind of 0.5%. Our total U.S. results were off 1% in the quarter, and this follows a 2% decrease in the second quarter. This sequential improvement follows a fairly steep deceleration from a solid start to the year when U.S. sales were up 4%. And we would add that September was the strongest month in an otherwise challenging quarter. With that said, we continue to operate in a generally sluggish sales environment, which we believe relates to the ongoing softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring seasons. 
As we noted on our last call, we had a similar weather pattern back in 2012 and experienced the same type of sluggish demand we are seeing today. What is different is that we had a hot summer across much of the U.S. this year, and we could see that having a positive impact on demand in the quarters ahead. 
And one final comment here would be that our Eastern, Central and Midwest regions, which benefit the most from the normal winter weather patterns, represent more than 40% of our U.S. revenues and continue to significantly underperform the balance of the country. 
We continue to analyze multitudes of data and scenarios including the impact of online competition, general competitive and pricing dynamics, trends and transportation, the number of vehicles entering our sweet spot and OE dealer warranties and services, among others, but do not believe that any one of these factors is having a material impact on our business. We have concluded that while it is important to consider each of these factors as we plan for the future, the challenges we are facing today are, in fact, transitory. As we anniversary last winter's mild weather and execute on our growth initiatives in the quarters ahead, we expect to further improve our sales results and ultimately return to our historical mid-single-digit growth rates. 
Turning now to a look at our U.S. company-owned store group. Same-store sales were down 2% in the third quarter, which is in line with our total U.S. sales before the positive impact of acquisitions. This follows flat year-over-year comps in the second quarter and plus 3% to begin the year. DIY and retail sales at our company stores were down mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transaction counts, while the average basket size was flat for the quarter. While disappointing overall, sales at the stores updated for our retail impact initiative are bucking this trend with double-digit retail sales increases. And while not in enough stores yet to make a mark on our total retail comps, we are confident in the long-term positive benefits of these initiatives. We are on plan to roll out this new retail concept in 150 company-owned stores this year and will accelerate the project to add an additional 300 stores in 2017. 
The commercial wholesale business at our company stores was down low single digits in the third quarter, driven by low to mid-single-digit declines at our major accounts and fleet business. Sales to our AutoCare centers were down slightly. Although on a more positive note, we added nearly 500 new AutoCare memberships thus far in 2016 and stand at over 16,000 members today. This is a testament to the overall value of this program to our independent installer base, and we look to this program to be a significant growth driver for us in the periods ahead. Our average wholesale transaction counts as well as ticket value were both down for the quarter. 
Moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S. automotive aftermarket. The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound. The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow. The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years, lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gains. Miles driven increased 3.4% in August, the most recent data available, and is up 3.1% year-to-date. August now marks 30 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric. The national average price of gasoline was $2.32 in the third quarter, well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases. 
We want to also update you on our international businesses which include Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand and Australia, our core Automotive business is performing well, with sales consistently up mid- to high single digits. In addition, we continue to see solid contributions from our recent acquisitions, and we have made significant progress with the integration of the Covs and AMX businesses acquired earlier this year. Likewise, we are pleased to report that, on September 1, we closed on the acquisition of ASL, a New Zealand-based automotive aftermarket distributor to the commercial side of the industry. ASL operates 15 branches with approximate annual revenues of USD 15 million. With these acquisitions, our footprint in Australia and New Zealand has grown now to 546 locations. This represents an increase of more than 100 net new stores over the past 3 years. Our leadership team in Asia Pacific continues to operate at a high level, and we see continued expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead. 
At NAPA Canada, we continue to produce low single-digit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting Western Canada. The July 1 acquisition of Auto-Camping, a leading distributor of OE import parts in Canada with annual revenues of approximately USD 50 million, has been a great addition to our Canadian business. 
Finally, in Mexico, our sales continue to gain momentum as we expand our NAPA footprint. We now have 28 stores in Mexico today, up from 21 on June  30, and we have plans for additional store growth in the periods ahead. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term growth prospects for NAPA in Mexico.
We have built a solid foundation of international operations, which currently account for approximately 30% of our total Automotive revenues. As we look to the future, we are well positioned for future growth opportunities across these markets. 
In summary, we faced a challenging sales environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, with these headwinds somewhat offset by the ongoing strength of our international operations as well as the positive impact of acquisitions and new distribution expansion. We look to improve on this quarter's performance in the periods ahead by expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts; executing our retail strategy; and driving global expansion via new-store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions. 
So turning now to our Industrial business. Motion Industries ended the quarter down 0.7%, which has slightly improved from the 2% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. After adjusting for acquisitions, core Industrial sales were down an approximate 2.5% and, again, a slight improvement on a sequential basis. As a reminder, this quarter's results include the August 1 acquisition of OBBCO, a regional industrial safety products distributor with estimated revenues of approximately $20 million. 
As we have said in recent quarters, our Industrial business has seemed to stabilize, although any signs of a meaningful recovery will most likely occur in 2017. The industrial indices we track, such as industrial production, capacity utilization and the PMI, simply remain too choppy to indicate otherwise. What we do know, however, is that we have seen these cycles before, and we are confident in our sales strategies and ability to generate strong growth in this business when the markets begin to strengthen. The question right now is one of timing. 
A review of our business by industry segment, top customers and top product categories further supports the choppy markets. Among our top 12 industry segments, our results were consistent with the second quarter, with 3 sectors up, 7 down and 2 unchanged from last year. And among our top 12 product categories, 6 were up and 6 were down, also consistent with last quarter. And finally, among our top 20 customers, 13 were up and 7 were down, which compares to 15 up and 5 down in the second quarter. 
So the takeaway again this quarter is that our results were relatively consistent with the most recent quarters and remain mixed among our customers and products. With that said, we would add that September was our strongest daily sales month of the year, and we are seeing growth across all regions of the U.S. other than in the oil and gas region of the Southwest. The encouraging news out of the Southwest is, while still running negative numbers, they are closing the gap. Additional positive news for the Southwest is the move of oil prices back to the $50 range. We are also encouraged to see the level of exported goods improving from the 6% to 7% declines we experienced in the first half of the year. These trends bode well for the industrial markets. 
Likewise, we recently announced the October 3 acquisition of Braas Company, a multiregional distributor of products and distribution services for industrial automation and control with estimated annual revenues of $90 million. The growth prospects for this segment of the industry including robotics, motion control and industrial networking are compelling, and the addition of such a well-positioned business will substantially enhance our automation capabilities.
So despite our cautionary stance on a near-term recovery, we continue to position this business for strong sales and earnings growth upon a recovery. You can also look for us to execute on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to EIS, our Electrical distribution segment. Sales for this group were down 9% due to several factors, some of which are also impacting our Industrial business. A few of the more impactful challenges this quarter include further weakness in our electrical markets, driven primarily by our business with the energy sector including oil, gas as well as coal. We're also seeing lower copper pricing and the overall effects on demand. It appears these headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. So as we work through this cycle, we'll be intensely focused on making the proper cost reductions and improving our efficiencies while also executing on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth over the long term.
To that end, on the 1st of this month, we acquired Communications Products and Services, a leading distributor of plant product solutions for both aerial and underground broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure. CPS further strengthens our cable operations in the Western U.S. and should generate approximately $12 million in annual revenues. 
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which reported a 5% increase in sales for the third quarter. This has improved from a 1% increase in the second quarter, driven by an 11% contribution from recent acquisitions. Our acquisitions, including Safety Zone, are performing well and contributing nicely to our growth strategy for the facilities and breakroom supplies category. Core sales for the office business were down 6% in the third quarter, a decrease from the 4% core sales decrease in the second quarter. Primarily, this was driven by weaker sales through the Mega Channel, which was down low single digits following mid-single-digit growth through the first half of the year. Sales through the independent reseller channel were down mid-single digits, consistent with the declines we have seen all year. 
on the product side, the facilities and breakroom supplies category, or FBS, posted strong growth in the quarter, while traditional office supplies, furniture and technology products each posted sales declines. 
This quarter was difficult for us as you can see in the numbers, but we are confident in our abilities to show more progress in the quarters ahead. Moving forward, we are focused on the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing FBS category. Our growth strategy involves strategic bolt-on acquisitions to further enhance our capabilities in this category as well as the execution of our ongoing share-of-wallet and market-share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry. 
So that is an overview of our performance by business. We continue to operate in a tough sales environment, but our teams are working hard in all aspects of our business to overcome these challenges and generate growth in the quarters ahead. 
Now I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and full year guidance. Carol?"
275034,403418531,1057578,"Genuine Parts Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 bil",2202,"Thank you, Paul. We'll begin with our financial review with a look at our third quarter income statement and the segment information, and then we'll review a few key balance sheet and other financial items. 
As Paul mentioned, total revenues of $3.94 billion for the third quarter was an increase of 0.5%. Gross profit for the third quarter was 30.4% of sales, which is an increase for the -- from the 29.8% in the prior year quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by favorable supplier incentives, product mix shift into higher-margin categories and the benefit of our more recent higher-margin acquisitions. Looking forward, we remain focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives, and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term. 
The pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively unchanged from where we've been for some time with very little supplier inflation, if any. Our cumulative supplier price changes through 9 months in 2016 were down 0.7% in Automotive, up 0.4% in Industrial, up 0.2% in Office and down 1.3% in Electrical. 
Turning to our SG&A. Our total expenses for the third quarter were $907 million, up 4% from last year and 23% of sales. Our increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the weak sales environment across all of our businesses. In addition, as we initially integrate our acquisitions into our existing operations, we can experience an uptick in costs. Ultimately, we're able to eliminate these excess costs and actually reduce our overall cost as we build on the synergies that we create with the combined businesses. We would also add that with certain acquisitions their models show higher gross margins, as mentioned earlier, but also a higher operating cost as well, so that's a factor in the current quarter. 
In the current sales environment, it's imperative that we [indiscernible] any expense that we have to ensure we are operating with the lowest possible cost structure. Managing our expenses with tight cost-control measures is ongoing at GPC but especially critical today, and we recognize that there's always need for improvement. 
Probably the most impactful initiative for us over the long term is that our businesses are rationalizing their facilities to streamline their cost structure wherever appropriate. This serves to reduce our distribution cost as well as our headcount- and payroll-related costs, which are significant expenses for us. Thus far, in 2016, we have closed or consolidated a number of distribution centers and branches, and we reduced our headcount by approximately 1%. Although these steps are meaningful, not all of the savings are in our numbers yet, and importantly, you'll see many more opportunities for further consolidation. 
Our ongoing investments in technology, which we've talked about for a long time now, are allowing us to do more and more of this type of rationalization while also maintaining our excellent customer service standards. So going forward, you can look for us to continue building a lower cost in a highly effective distribution infrastructure across our businesses. 
Now we'll discuss the results by segment. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $2.1 billion, up 1.5% from the prior year and 53% of total sales. Operating profit of $198 million is down 2%, with the operating margin for this group at 9.4% compared to 9.8% in the third quarter last year. This primarily reflects the pressure on our operating expenses due to the decline in our core Automotive sales. 
Industrial sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, 0.7% decrease from the prior year and 29% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $86 million is down 5%, and our operating margin is 7.4% compared to the 7.7% last year. Similar to our Automotive margins, the pressure on the margin for this business relates to the lack of sales growth and its impact on our operating expenses despite good progress with our ongoing cost reductions and facility rationalizations. 
Office Products revenues were $535 million and 14% of our total sales, up 5% overall but down 6% excluding acquisitions. Our operating profit of $30 million is down 17%, and our operating margin is 5.7%. This group experienced significant pressure on their operating expenses this quarter due to 3 primary factors: the decrease in their organic sales, the rising cost associated with serving a growing number of sales channels and incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. The Office team is taking immediate measures to address these areas and drive cost savings in the quarters ahead. 
The Electrical group sales were $178 million in the quarter, down 9% from 2015 and 4% of our total revenue. Operating profit of $14 million is down 29%, and the operating margin for this group is 8.0% compared to a 10.2% margin last year. The decline in revenues was difficult to overcome this quarter, but this team is also working fast to reduce their cost and to show improvement in the quarters ahead. 
So our total operating profit margin for the third quarter was 8.3% compared to 8.9% last year, disappointing but essentially a function of the weak sales environment, which we have discussed, and we're intensely focused on reducing our cost to drive margin expansion. 
We had net interest expense of $5.2 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we currently expect net interest expense of approximately $20 million. Our total amortization expense was $10.3 million for the third quarter, and we would estimate total amortization expense of approximately $39 million for the full year. Our depreciation expense is $27.3 million for the quarter, and we would expect the full year to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. So the combined depreciation and amortization number would be approximately $145 million to $160 million for the full year. 
The other line, which primarily reflects our corporate expense, was $21.1 million in the quarter compared to $34.3 million last year. The decrease in corporate expense primarily reflects the benefit of gains on the sale of certain real estate as well as the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments. For the full year, we currently expect corporate expense to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36.4% compared to 37.4% last year. The reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, and the favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment we just discussed, which is nontaxable. For the full year, we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.5%. 
Net income for the quarter of $185.3 million and EPS of $1.24, which was equal to the third quarter last year. 
Now we'll turn to a discussion of the balance sheet, which we further strengthened in the third quarter with effective working capital management and strong cash flows. Our cash at September 30 was $225 million, a $26 million increase from last year, even as we've increased our spending for acquisitions. So our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across each of our distribution businesses. Accounts receivable of $2 billion at September 30 is up 3.5% from the prior year and adjusted for the impact of currency translation is up 2%. We continue to closely manage our receivables, and we remain satisfied with our quality at this time. 
Our inventory at quarter end was $3.1 billion, which is up 6% from the prior year, although it's actually down slightly when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions as well as currency. Our teams are doing a very good job of effectively managing our inventory levels, and we'll continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward. 
Accounts payable at September 30 was $3.1 billion, up 9% from last year, including a slight benefit of currency. Our ongoing progress in growing our accounts payable reflects improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors. This has had a positive impact on our working capital and days in payables, and we would add that our AP-to-inventory ratio stands at 98.5% at September 30. 
Our working capital of $1.5 billion at September 30 is down from last year and showing steady improvement over multiple periods. Effectively managing our working capital remains a high priority for the company, and we continue to expect further improvement in the quarters ahead. 
Our total debt of $775 million is unchanged from June 30, and it compares to a $625 million in total debt last year. Our debt includes 2 $250 million term notes and a new 5-year, 2.39% $50 million term note that closed in July. We have another $225 million in borrowings under our multicurrency revolving line of credit. One of our 2 $250 million term notes is due this November, and we've recently entered into an agreement for a new 10-year note with a favorable interest rate of 2.99%, down from the current rate of 3.35%. Our total debt capitalization is approximately 19%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We continue to believe that our current structure provides the company with both the flexibility and the financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may have.
In summary, our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of the company. We have consistently generated strong cash flows, and following a record year in 2015, we are well positioned for another solid year in 2016. 
We continue to expect our cash from operations to be in the $900 million to $1 billion range for the full year; and free cash flow, which deducts capital expenditures and dividends, to be in the $400 million to $450 million range. We remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our priorities for cash include strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend.
Strategic acquisitions remain an ongoing and important use of cash for us, and they're integral to the growth plans for our company. Thus far in 2016, we have added a number of new businesses across each of the 4 business segments. These are excellent strategic fits for us, and collectively, we expect them to generate over $600 million in annual revenues going forward. 
As we move forward, we'll continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities across our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth. We'll continue to target those bolt-on types of companies with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, but we are open-minded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes, large or small, assuming the appropriate returns on investment. 
Turning to share repurchases. We've purchased 249,000 shares in the third quarter and 1.6 million shares for the 9 months. Today, we have 4.7 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program in the periods ahead, as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and, combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Our investment and capital expenditures was $37 million for the third quarter and $87 million through September. For the year, we are continuing to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $120 million to $140 million for the full year. 
Turning to our dividend. The 2016 dividend of $2.63 a share, which is a 7% increase from the $2.46 per share paid in 2015. 2016 also marked our 60th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. 
Now this concludes our financial update for the third quarter of 2016. In summary, our businesses are operating in a difficult sales environment, but our teams are hard at work to overcome these challenges and to generate growth. From top to bottom, we are evaluating the cost structures to drive greater efficiencies and cost savings. We believe these efforts will position the company well for future sales and earnings growth. 
Now we'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Based on our current performance and the outlook for the balance of the year, we're updating our full year guidance for total sales to flat to up 1% from the previous up 1% to up 2%. Among our business segments, we're lowering Automotive sales guidance to up 1% to up 2% from the previous up 2% to up 3%. We're reducing our Industrial sales guidance to flat to down 1% from a previous flat to up 1%. We're reducing our Electrical sales to down 5% to down 6% from a previous down 2% to down 3%. We are maintaining our Office sales guidance at plus 2% to plus 3%. This sales outlook includes those acquisitions included in our 9-month results as well as the Braas and CPS acquisitions that closed this month. On the earnings side, we're lowering our earnings per share guidance to $4.55 to $4.60 from the previous $4.70 to $4.75 for the full year. 
So this completes our prepared remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Paul at this time."

Before we go to questions, I just want to add a few additional remarks we feel are important. First, we want to remind you of the action steps we outlined in our last call, which are the 4 building blocks of our growth strategy. These are: one, executing our key initiatives to capture greater share of wallet with our existing customer base; two, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions; three, building out our digital capabilities across all 4 of our businesses; and four, further expanding our U.S. and international store footprint. We are confident that, over time, our intense focus in these 4 key areas will positively impact our sales performance and drive the ongoing steady and consistent growth we look to achieve and our stakeholders expect. 
Second, we want to assure you that our current performance was not up to our expectations. As we speak, we continue to evaluate our cost structure in all areas of the business to drive immediate savings and longer-term efficiencies. Our goal is to show improved results in the quarters ahead and better position the company for sustainable growth well into the future. As Carol shared earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows to support our efforts. 
So in closing, as we look ahead, we're excited with the many opportunities we have at GPC and can point to many positive factors fueling our optimism: we operate in 4 large and fragmented industries with less than 10% market share in each; the outlook for the automotive aftermarket continues to be positive; the industrial sector is showing early signs of a recovery; our balance sheet continues -- our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, supporting effective capital allocation strategy; our steady track record of increased dividends for 60 consecutive years; and last but certainly not least, our team of 40,000 dedicated GPC associates around the globe committed to delivering exceptional customer service. 
So despite our current challenges, we feel very good about the long-term prospects for growth at GPC. We've been operating now for 88-plus years and we've been through challenging times before. And as we move forward, we'll make the necessary adjustments, and we will emerge as a stronger company. We look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
So with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will take your questions."

If you look at the indices that we follow, the ISM September numbers were positive, which rebounded from a negative number in August. So we're starting to see a bit of an uptick in our Industrial business as well."

And then I think the other big part of this is the acquisitions that certainly -- I mean, we've made 16 or so acquisitions this year, and all those acquisitions come in -- many of them come in with a different cost structure, but certainly accretive on the margin side, but they're coming in with higher SG&A. And in some, you have some incremental costs when you first have these acquisitions, and it takes up a couple of quarters to get those costs out. So I think, all in all, the weak sales factor is the biggest thing that's impacting the SG&A. But I can tell you, our teams are working very, very hard right now to address all of our costs. And we've done a lot of work on our headcount. We've done a lot of work on our facilities. And then when you see the improvements we've done, it just hasn't been enough to offset the decline in the core sales."
