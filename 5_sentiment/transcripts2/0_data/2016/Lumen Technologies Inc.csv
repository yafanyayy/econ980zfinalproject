I'll make a few remarks about 2015 and discuss 2016 objectives and our guidance. Beginning on Slide 6, 2015 was really a year of 2 very different halves for CenturyLink. In the first half, our sales and revenue trends were softer than we anticipated, entering the year during 2014 as part of our ongoing review of our business. We had identified an opportunity to improve the structure of our sales force when we began to implement this change in late 2014. Our sales organization realignment was more complex. It look longer than anticipated, and by midyear, operating expenses were out of alignment with our revenue outlook for the remainder of 2015, and we began to take aggressive corrective action in the second half of the year. And the benefits of the realignment, along with new leadership, began to take hold when we approved our overall sales performance and we increased our sales funnel of opportunities and enhanced our revenue trends. 
At the same time, we were also successful in taking costs out of the business. We reduced planned operating expenses in the second half of 2015 by more than $125 million, then the full $125 [ph] million target we had set in August. These actions have just delivered very strong results from the fourth quarter as revenues, cash flows and adjusted earnings per share all exceeded our expectations for the quarter. As we will highlight in more detail later in the call, we saw good in performance from our Consumer segment during the quarter. Growth in Prism TV customers along with higher average revenue per customer drove year-over-year consumer revenue growth. Also, for fourth quarter, business high-bandwidth data services grew approximately 9% year-over-year. So overall, we achieved significant improvement in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half of the year. 
Continuing on now to Slide 7, we also continue to focus on driving higher speeds across our network as we ended 2015 with 940,000 GPON addressable households and 490,000 GPON addressable businesses. And we provided more than 30% of our service area or addressable units with speeds of 40 megabytes or higher. We believe that's a speed that in the marketplace is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase authorization in early December and we returned a total of $2 billion to CenturyLink shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. As you know, in early November, we announced we were beginning a strategic review process of our data centers and colocation business. This decision was made as part of our continued efforts to proactively manage our portfolio of assets to better position the company to compete to achieve profitable growth and drive our shareholder value. We made good progress with the process since our November announcement. We have established a separate data center/co-location organization, including a separate management team. We're also nearly complete with carve-out financial statements for our data centers and colocation business to provide -- the potential to acquire our partners. We've spoken to a number of interested parties, who expressed interest in all options, ranging from an outright purchase of our data centers and colo business, a partnership and/or a joint venture. This is an ongoing process and could result in any one of these outcomes, including the potential sale of a portion of our -- all of our data center business. 
Also as we have said, we could ultimately choose to retain these assets and related operations. As we outlined in November, we believe in the macro trends of the data center colocation industry and the importance of the surface and our hybrid IT solutions. But we do not believe we must own the colocation facilities to provide the full range of services our customers need to manage their IT functions. We expect to formally engage interested parties within the next 2 weeks or so. 
Continuing on now to Slide 8. As we enter 2016, we thought it might be useful to share with you a broader view of how we think about our business and operational focus for 2016 and beyond. First, I think it's important that we declare for ourselves why we're here what we are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish as an organization. And for us, that purpose is to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the digital world, whether it's providing connections or services on top of that connection using the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and businesses, is really what were all about. We expect to accomplish this purpose through a 2-part, mutually reinforcing mission. First, we provide our customers a gateway to the digital world by enabling fast, highly reliable broadband connections that are automated and easy to use. We also have significant opportunity to take a leadership position on this front, and our principal focus going forward will be to provide our customers the very best network experience; second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intensive investments, higher growth solutions that deliver customers a full range of technology-focused services, such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video along with over-the-top applications and content. We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services to our customers, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the Network Services offerings that are at the heart of our customer relationships. 
Continuing on to Slide 9. Looking at our purpose from a financial point of view, our focus is to create long-term shareholder value through both revenue growth and strong cash flow generation. I won't emphasize this last point. The focus of our business is to drive long-term free cash flow generation that enable us to continue to invest in our business and sustain our strong dividend. And we will prioritize investments and operational initiatives to support that outcome. We believe we can accomplish our goals to focus on 3 key operational initiatives. First, we will maximize market penetration of our network and adjacent services to drive growth. To accomplish this, we plan to maximize penetration in areas where we have invested in and enabled broadband capabilities. We will also continue to focus on investments, while enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity. And we will enable other technology-focused solutions such as managed network, hosting cloud, IT services and video using capital position solutions and partnerships. 
Our second key initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As part of this effort, we plan to simplify our products, our processes and our systems, and we will continue our evolution through a single orchestration layer that automates the end-to-end customer experience that enables them access the complement of the services for cable providers. This will take time, but we have a roadmap in place to significantly improve our customer experience over the next couple of years. 
Finally, redeploy a disciplined approach to our operating and capital investments to deliver profitable growth, first, by investing more capital to enable high-bandwidth network connectivity and pursuing capital-light investment approaches for a complementary adjacent services. Allocating capital based on the best returns on investment and opportunities in key strategic objectives will be key. We also expect to gain revenue and operating expense efficiencies and improve cash flow operations through more aggressive systems consolidation, automation and process improvement. We have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on the operational areas, we will be able to build on CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Finally, we'll focus on specific actions to drive sales and revenue growth of our strategic products in service in 2016 and beyond. We expect to drive further penetration of our consumer business and GPON footprint of over 900,000 households and almost 500,000 businesses and our 3 million households enabled for Prism TV service. And we expect to continue to expand high-bandwidth data services, GPON and Prism, enabling further revenue upside opportunities. We also believe we can continue sales momentum from the second half of 2015 and drive increased sales productivity through better go-to-market alignment, leveraging products, specialists and enabling additional sales in sales performance tools. And we plan to focus on winning large deals through dedicated teams and system integration and value-added resellers -- our system at the integrators and value-added resellers. Expanded distribution partners will be key to this hitting our goals and driving this revenue. 
And 1 final item, I'm sure you saw our release this afternoon announcing our new president of sales and marketing, a new Chief Marketing Officer. We look forward to Dean Douglas and Bill Hurley joining our team next week, and I'm confident they will be key contributors to helping us achieve the actions I just discussed. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for discussion of our financial results and liquidity position as well as our guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter, provide an overview of the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my",1226,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter, provide an overview of the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink liquidity position. 
Regarding our guidance, we were pleased that our full year expectations for 2016 are in line or better than current average analyst estimates. 
Now moving to Slide 11, I will review a few highlights from our fourth quarter results. Please note that I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieve strong results for the fourth quarter and operating revenues were $4.48 billion on a consolidated basis, 9/10 of a percent increase from fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in high-cost support revenues of approximately $60 million due to the recognition of CAF Phase II support during the fourth quarter 2015 along with strength in high-bandwidth data services and consumer strategic revenues. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.03 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of only 0.5% from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products, including high-speed data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. 
In the fourth quarter, we added approximately 16,000 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers declined about 22,000 during the quarter, partially as a result of tighter credit standards implemented in midyear 2015. We generated operative cash flow of approximately $1.82 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 40.6%. Cash expenses for the fourth quarter declined to $72 million year-over-year primarily due to lower employee related costs. And on a sequential quarter basis, cash basis declined to $115 million or 4.1% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest in capital expenditures along with other income, was 550 -- $591 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.80. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, as Glen mentioned earlier, we repurchased more than 10 million shares for an investment of nearly $280 million during the fourth quarter, which completed the $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Moving to Slide 12 and our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $43 million or 1.6% from the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 1.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS and Ethernet, partially offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.2% from fourth quarter 2014 due primarily to continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related expenses and CPE cost. Our segment margin was 44.1%, which was an increase from 43.6% a year ago. 
Now turn to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $19 million or 1.3% from fourth quarter 2014. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.3% year-over-year to $773 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined only 3.4% from fourth quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses decreased $17 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.40 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.95 billion to $4 billion and operating cash flow between $1.66 million and $1.72 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.73. Our anticipated sequential decrease in first quarter operating revenues compared to fourth quarter 2015 is primarily due to declines in legacy, hosting and low-bandwidth data services more than offsetting the anticipated growth in revenues from high-bandwidth data services. We expect first quarter 2016 operating cash flow to be lower than fourth quarter 2015, primarily driven by the decline in revenues I just mentioned along with higher costs. Those higher costs include approximately $35 million from onetime favorable expense items in the fourth quarter, and in the first quarter, $25 million of higher payroll taxes and $20 million related to higher marketing costs. 
For full year 2016, we expect operating revenues of $17.5 billion to $17.8 billion and core revenues of $17.75 billion to $16 billion. Both are expected to be slightly lower compared to full year 2015 expected legacy revenue declines more than offsetting anticipated increases in the level of strategic revenue growth. Our operating cash flow for full year 2016 is expected to be $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, lower than full year 2015, primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and low-bandwidth data revenues. The company anticipates lower depreciation and amortization expense for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2016 is projected to be $2.50 to $2.70. The expected lower full year operating cash flow for 2016, along with higher cash income taxes and anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of $3 billion, are expected to lower free cash flow to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we recently issued $235 million of debt to refinance upcoming maturities, we thought we would provide you with our plans for our maturities over the remainder of the year. Our total debt maturities for 2016 are approximately $1.4 billion. As I mentioned in January, we completed a $235 million debt issuance of 7%, Qwest core 4-year [ph] notes that will be used to refinance an upcoming May 1 maturity. That primarily leads us with an embark debt maturity of a little less than $1.2 billion on June 1. We expect to be opportunistic in the coming months in refinancing some or all of that debt as well at the CenturyLink parent level. It's important to note that with approximately $400 million as of -- drawn as of the end of 2015 on our $2 billion credit facility, we have the capacity to handle the June 1 maturity if needed. Additionally, since we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program in early December, we could also use available free cash flow for a portion of the June 1 maturity if necessary. 
as indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow after the cash dividend, which results in our dividend payout ratio in the low to mid-60% range in 2016, which is very sustainable. So we're confident that our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the day. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

For Stewart, just first, #1, as we kind of look at the 2016 guide, obviously, last year, we had an issue with kind of overestimating how the year was going to play out. So I was wondering if you can kind of talk a little bit about what the base case expectations that you've modeled out for the economy and sales force ramp? And whether you're incoming head of revenue? Mr. Douglas has bought into these expectations, and kind of your comfort level of achievement. That will be #1. Second would be on the cash tax outlook and kind of the update on bonus tax depreciation, what's embedded in that free cash flow guidance? And then the last one, if I could, will just be kind of the meter data opportunity. I think we've been seeing a lot of the cable companies experimenting with data caps and metering higher-end usage. It seems like the FCC is not pushing back on this and it feels like it could be a big opportunity for telcos do, if nothing else, price underneath the cable umbrella and start to raise rates from high-end users. I was wondering if that's something that you guys are looking at as an opportunity and where it stands?"

We think we have some things in place from a sales standpoint. Our funnel continues to build and look good. We have a number of big deals that are in the funnel and hopefully, we can get the closure with some of those. We're also working on the provisioning, the audit and cash to get the sales that the salespeople make provisioned and in the billing quicker and hope to be able to get that done over the course of the next few months to where we can reduce our cycle times there. That will help. The other focus that we have is on churn reduction, so we are working there to try to keep the customers we have and try to make some of the price declines and credits that we've been issuing smaller. So we hope -- we're hopeful that we're attacking revenue, not just from a sales standpoint this year, but also from the standpoint of reducing churn as well as getting the orders into cash quicker. And we've also have a big team as we've talked about before that were launched to pursue larger opportunities. In terms of the guidance and the macroeconomic issues, I mean, we basically assumed that the economy stays about, like as it is at this point, so no real certificate changes there.

They obviously have the aptitude to get into detail, but I know we've had discussions with them and they believe we have upside in a lot of areas, but they have not had a chance to really get into details of our projections at this point. And from the standpoint of -- just to kind of close out the revenue, we had some revenue growth this year in the fourth quarter. We did in the first quarter of 2015. We would expect probably second quarter 2016, we would reach a little bit of revenue growth. But in terms -- were going to be so close just in terms of projecting that we're going to hit stability and growth on a sequential basis quarter after quarter. It's really not possible for us to do it now, but we think that with the three-pronged approach that we have to really driving revenue, keeping the revenue we have, getting customers to build quicker, it will pay dividends for us from the standpoint of getting real momentum in terms of our revenue growth. In terms of cash taxes, our cash taxes for 2015 were $63 million. Based on the operating income guidance that we provided for 2016, we would expect cash taxes to be approximately $400 million at the low end of guidance and about $600 million at the high end of guidance. And as we say with the free cash flow that, that results in after the operating income, you result in the dividend payout ratio being in the low to mid-60s. I might add that dividend payout ratio in 2017, at this point, we would say we would be kind of in the low to mid-70s because, we think that cash taxes will increase somewhat in 2017, just because the impact of bonus depreciation will be less as it matures more."

We've seen a pretty tough quarter so far for the telcos relative to the cable, and we touched on that on an earlier question.

And frankly, it's really -- we've looked at the potential of refinancing down at the EMBARQ level. It creates another public entity that we have to do public filings all in all, and we just think it's not worth the effort of all of that as well as the right differentials that's not that significant. So we've been -- for the last 5 years or so, have been working to refinance debt on Qwest Corp. At Qwest Corp, the debt maturities there because it is still investment-grade. Everything else is -- the parent is not investment-grade. So we've been moving everything up there and we think that -- I mean, we've had really good with a good execution over the years.

So we've gotten -- we will have, by the end of '16, achieved about $700 million of the little bit over $1 billion deferral that we expect to get during the life of the bonus depreciation legislation.

I'll make a few remarks about 2015 and discuss 2016 objectives and our guidance. Beginning on Slide 6, 2015 was really a year of 2 very different halves for CenturyLink. In the first half, our sales and revenue trends were softer than we had anticipated entering the year. During 2014, as part of our ongoing review of our business, we had identified an opportunity to improve the structure of our sales force when we began to implement this change in late 2014. Our sales organization realignment was more complex. It took longer than anticipated, and by midyear, operating expenses were out of alignment with our revenue outlook for the remainder of 2015. And we began to take aggressive corrective action in the second half of the year. And the benefits of the realignment, along with new leadership, began to take hold when we improved our overall sales performance and we increased our sales funnel of opportunities and enhanced our revenue trends. 
At the same time, we were also successful in taking costs out of the business. We reduced planned operating expenses in the second half of 2015 by more than $125 million -- than the full $125 million target we had set in August. These actions helped us deliver very strong results from the fourth quarter as revenues, cash flows and adjusted earnings per share all exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
As we will highlight in more detail later in the call, we saw good performance from our Consumer segment during the quarter. Growth in Prism TV customers, along with higher average revenue per customer, drove year-over-year consumer revenue growth. Also, for fourth quarter, business high-bandwidth data services grew approximately 9% year-over-year. So overall, we achieved significant improvement in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half of the year. 
Continuing on now to Slide 7, we also continued to focus on driving higher speeds across our network as we ended 2015 with 940,000 GPON addressable households and 490,000 GPON addressable businesses. And we provided more than 30% of our service area or addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher. We believe that's the speed that in the marketplace is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we completed a $1 billion share repurchase authorization in early December, and we returned a total of $2 billion to CenturyLink shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. 
As you know, in early November, we announced we were beginning a strategic review process of our data centers and colocation business. This decision was made as part of our continued efforts to proactively manage our portfolio by assets to best position the company to compete to achieve profitable growth and drive our shareholder value. We made good progress with the process. Since our November announcement, we have established a separate data center/co-location organization, including a separate management team. We are also nearly complete with carve-out financial statements for our data centers and colocation business to provide -- to potential to acquire our partners. We've spoken to a number of interested parties, who expressed interest in all options, ranging from an outright purchase of our data centers and colo business, a partnership and/or a joint venture. This is an ongoing process and could result in any one of these outcomes, including the potential sale of a portion of our -- all of our data center business. Also as we have said, we could ultimately choose to retain these assets and related operations. 
As we outlined in November, we believe in the macro trends of the data center colocation industry and the importance of the service in our hybrid IT solutions. But we do not believe we must own the colocation facilities to provide the full range of services our customers need to manage their IT functions. We expect to formally engage interested parties within the next 2 weeks or so. 
Continuing on now to Slide 8. As we enter 2016, we thought it might be useful to share with you a broader view of how we think about our business and operational focus for 2016 and beyond. First, I think it's important that we declare for ourselves why we're here, what we are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish as an organization. And for us, that purpose is to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the digital world, whether it's providing connections or services on top of that connection using the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and businesses, is really what we are all about. We expect to accomplish this purpose through a 2-part, mutually reinforcing mission. First, we provide our customers a gateway to the digital world by enabling fast, highly reliable broadband connections that are automated and easy to use. We also have significant opportunity to take a leadership position on this front, and our principal focus going forward will be to provide our customers the very best network experience. 
Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intensive investments, higher-growth solutions to deliver our customers a full range of technology-focused services, such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video, along with over-the-top applications and content. We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services to our customers, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the Network Services offerings that are at the heart of our customer relationships. 
Continuing on to Slide 9. Looking at our purpose from a financial point of view, our focus is to create long-term shareholder value through both revenue growth and strong cash flow generation. I want to emphasize this last point. The focus of our business is to drive long-term free cash flow generation that enables us to continue to invest in our business and sustain our strong dividend. And we will prioritize investments and operational initiatives to support that outcome. 
We believe we can accomplish our goals to focus on 3 key operational initiatives. First, we will maximize market penetration of our network and adjacent services to drive growth. To accomplish this, we plan to maximize penetration in areas where we have invested in and enabled broadband capabilities. We will also continue to focus on investments while enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity. And we will enable other technology-focused solutions such as managed network, hosting, cloud, IT services and video using capital-efficient solutions and partnerships. 
Our second key initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As part of this effort, we plan to simplify our products, our processes and our systems, and we will continue our evolution to a single orchestration layer that automates the end-to-end customer experience that enables them to access the complementary services from multiple providers. This will take time, but we have a roadmap in place to significantly improve our customer experience over the next couple of years. 
Finally, we deploy a disciplined approach to our operating capital investments to deliver profitable growth, first, by investing more capital to enable high-bandwidth network connectivity and pursuing capital-light investment approaches for a complementary adjacent services. Allocating capital based on the best returns on investment and opportunities in key strategic objectives will be key. We also expect to gain revenue and operating expense efficiencies and improve cash flow operations through more aggressive systems consolidation, automation and process improvement. We have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on these operational areas, we will be able to build on CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Finally, we'll focus on specific actions to drive sales and revenue growth of our strategic products in service in 2016 and beyond. We expect to drive further penetration of our consumer business and GPON footprint of over 900,000 households and almost 500,000 businesses and our 3 million households enabled for Prism TV service. And we expect to continue to expand high-bandwidth data services, GPON and Prism, enabling further revenue upside opportunities. We also believe we can continue sales momentum from the second half of 2015 and drive increased sales productivity through better go-to-market alignment, leveraging products, specialists and enabling additional sales and sales performance tools. And we plan to focus on winning large deals through dedicated teams and system integration and value-added resellers -- or system integrators and value-added resellers. Expanding our distribution partners are the key to hitting our goals and driving this revenue. 
And one final item, I'm sure you saw our release this afternoon, announcing our new president of sales and marketing, a new Chief Marketing Officer. We look forward to Dean Douglas and Bill Hurley joining our team next week, and I'm confident they will be key contributors to helping us achieve the actions I've just discussed. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and liquidity position as well as our guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter, provide an overview of the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position. Regarding our guidance, we are pleased that our full year expectations for 2016 are in line or better than current average analyst estimates. 
Now moving to Slide 11. I will review a few highlights from our fourth quarter results. Please note that I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieve strong results for the fourth quarter, and operating revenues were $4.48 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.9% increase from fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in high-cost support revenues of approximately $60 million due to the recognition of CAF Phase II support during the fourth quarter 2015, along with strength in high-bandwidth data services and consumer strategic revenues. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.03 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of only 0.5% from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products, including high-speed data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. 
In the fourth quarter, we added approximately 16,000 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers declined about 22,000 during the quarter, partially as a result of tighter credit standards implemented in midyear 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.82 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 40.6%. Cash expenses for the fourth quarter declined to $72 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. And on a sequential quarter basis, cash expenses declined to $115 million or 4.1% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income, was 550 -- $591 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.80. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.  Additionally, as Glen mentioned earlier, we repurchased more than 10 million shares for an investment of nearly $280 million during the fourth quarter, which completed the $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Moving to Slide 12 and our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $43 million or 1.6% from the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 1.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS and Ethernet, partially offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.2% from fourth quarter 2014 due primarily to continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related expenses and CPE cost. Our segment margin was 44.1%, which was an increase from 43.6% a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $19 million or 1.3% from fourth quarter 2014. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.3% year-over-year to $773 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined only 3.4% from fourth quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses decreased $17 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.40 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.95 billion to $4 billion and operating cash flow between $1.66 million and $1.72 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.73. Our anticipated sequential decrease in first quarter operating revenues compared to fourth quarter 2015 is primarily due to declines in legacy, hosting and low-bandwidth data services more than offsetting the anticipated growth in revenues from high-bandwidth data services. We expect first quarter 2016 operating cash flow to be lower than fourth quarter 2015, primarily driven by the decline in revenues I just mentioned, along with higher costs. Those higher costs include approximately $35 million from onetime favorable expense items in the fourth quarter; and in the first quarter, $25 million of higher payroll taxes and $20 million related to higher-marketing costs. 
For full year 2016, we expect operating revenues of $17.55 billion to $17.8 billion and core revenues of $15.75 billion to $16 billion. Both are expected to be slightly lower compared to full year 2015 expected legacy revenue declines more than offsetting anticipated increases in the level of strategic revenue growth. 
Our operating cash flow for the full year 2016 is expected to be $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, lower than full year 2015, primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and low-bandwidth data revenues. The company anticipates lower depreciation and amortization expense for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2016 is projected to be $2.50 to $2.70. The expected lower full year operating cash flow for 2016, along with higher cash income taxes and anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of $3 billion, are expected to lower free cash flow to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we recently issued $235 million of debt to refinance upcoming maturities, we thought we would provide you with our plans for our maturities over the remainder of the year. Our total debt maturities for 2016 are approximately $1.4 billion. As I mentioned in January, we completed a $235 million debt issuance of 7% Qwest Corp. 4-year notes that will be used to refinance an upcoming May 1 maturity. That primarily leads us with an EMBARQ debt maturity of a little less than $1.2 billion on June 1. We expect to be opportunistic in the coming months in refinancing some or all of that debt as well at the CenturyLink parent level. It's important to note that with approximately $400 million as of -- drawn as of the end of 2015 on our $2 billion credit facility, we have the capacity to handle the June 1 maturity if needed. Additionally, since we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program in early December, we can also use available free cash flow for a portion of the June 1 maturity if necessary. 
As indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow after the cash dividend, which results in our dividend payout ratio in the low to mid-60% range in 2016, which is very sustainable.

For Stewart, just first, number one, as we kind of look at the 2016 guide, obviously, last year, we had an issue with kind of overestimating how the year was going to play out. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about what the base case expectations that you've modeled out for the economy and sales force ramp, and whether you're incoming head of revenue, Mr. Douglas, has bought into these expectations, and kind of your comfort level of achievement. That'll be number one. Second would be on the cash tax outlook and kind of the update on bonus tax depreciation, what's embedded in that free cash flow guidance? And then the last one, if I could, would just be on kind of the meter data opportunity. I think we've been seeing a lot of the cable companies experimenting with data caps and metering higher-end usage. It seems like the FCC is not pushing back on this, and it feels like it could be a big opportunity for telcos to, if nothing else, price underneath the cable umbrella and start to raise rates from high-end users. I was wondering if that's something that you guys are looking at as an opportunity and where it stands?"

So David, in terms of 2016 revenue guidance, I mean, I believe we do feel more comfortable with the revenue guidance that we have this year from the guidance that we provided in '15. We think we have some things in place from a sales standpoint. Our funnel continues to build and look good. We have a number of big deals that are in the funnel, and hopefully, we can get the closure with some of those. We're also working on the provisioning, the order to cash, to get the sales that the salespeople make provisioned and in the billing quicker and hope to be able to get that done over the course of the next few months to where we can reduce our cycle times there. That will help. The other focus that we have is on churn reduction, so we're working there to try to keep the customers we have and try to make some of the price declines and credits that we've been issuing smaller. So we hope -- we're hopeful that we're attacking revenue, not just from a sales standpoint this year, but also from the standpoint of reducing churn as well as getting the orders into cash quicker. And we've also have a big deal team that, as we've talked about before, that we launched to pursue larger opportunities. In terms of the guidance and the macroeconomic issues, I mean, we basically have assumed that the economy stays about like it is at this point, so no real significant changes there.

But in terms -- were going to be so close just in terms of projecting that we're going to hit stability and growth on a sequential basis quarter-after-quarter. It's really not possible for us to do that now, but we think that with the three-pronged approach that we have to really driving revenue, keeping the revenue we have, getting customers to billing quicker, it will pay dividends for us from the standpoint of getting some real momentum in terms of our revenue growth. In terms of cash taxes, our cash taxes for 2015 were $63 million. Based on the operating income guidance that we provided for 2016, we would expect cash taxes to be approximately $400 million at the low end of guidance and about $600 million at the high end of guidance. And as we say with the free cash flow that, that results in -- after the operating income, you result in the dividend payout ratio being in the low to mid-60s. I might add that dividend payout ratio in 2017, at this point, we would say we would be kind of in the low to mid-70s, because we think that cash taxes will increase somewhat in 2017 just because the impact of bonus depreciation will be less as it matures more."

As we stated in the 8-K that we filed, really, in connection with any review of the board slate, the nominating governance committee recommended and the board ultimately concluded that Joe should stand for reelection at the 2016 meeting. The board felt that the change would lead to an environment with improved productivity and constructive dialogue. It was really just a board chemistry issue is what this was. And no time has Joe raised any issue about the company's accounting or financial reporting, either leading up to or following his resignation. Also, Joe didn't raise concerns about the company's strategy or succession planning prior to his resignation, at least not that I'm aware of or board members were aware of. His principal complaint related to the process, the board used to reach the conclusion that he would not be included on the 2016 slate. And I think, actually, in my comments to that, there are lot of details in our 8-K we filed on January 25, and you can maybe read all of that.

I'll make a few remarks about 2015 and discuss 2016 objectives and our guidance. Beginning on Slide 6, 2015 was really a year of 2 very different halves for CenturyLink. In the first half, our sales and revenue trends were softer than we had anticipated entering the year. During 2014, as part of our ongoing review of our business, we had identified an opportunity to improve the structure of our sales force when we began to implement this change in late 2014. Our sales organization realignment was more complex. It took longer than anticipated, and by midyear, operating expenses were out of alignment with our revenue outlook for the remainder of 2015. And we began to take aggressive corrective action in the second half of the year. And the benefits of the realignment, along with new leadership, began to take hold when we improved our overall sales performance and we increased our sales funnel opportunities and enhanced our revenue trends. 
At the same time, we were also successful in taking costs out of the business. We reduced planned operating expenses in the second half of 2015 by more than $125 million -- than the full $125 million target we had set in August. These actions helped us deliver very strong results from the fourth quarter as revenues, cash flows and adjusted earnings per share all exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
As we will highlight in more detail later in the call, we saw good performance from our Consumer segment during the quarter. Growth in Prism TV customers, along with higher average revenue per customer, drove year-over-year consumer revenue growth. Also, for fourth quarter, business high-bandwidth data services grew approximately 9% year-over-year. So overall, we achieved significant improvement in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half of the year. 
Continuing on now to Slide 7, we also continued to focus on driving higher speeds across our network as we ended 2015 with 940,000 GPON addressable households and 490,000 GPON addressable businesses. And we provided more than 30% of our service area or addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher. We believe that's the speed that in the marketplace is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we completed a $1 billion share repurchase authorization in early December, and we returned a total of $2 billion to CenturyLink shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. 
As you know, in early November, we announced we were beginning a strategic review process of our data centers and colocation business. This decision was made as part of our continued efforts to proactively manage our portfolio of assets to best position the company to compete to achieve profitable growth and drive our shareholder value. We made good progress with process. Since our November announcement, we have established a separate data center/colocation organization, including a separate management team. We are also nearly complete with carve-out financial statements for our data centers and colocation business to provide to potential acquirers our partners. We've spoken to a number of interested parties, who expressed interest in all options, ranging from an outright purchase of our data centers and colo business, a partnership and/or a joint venture. This is an ongoing process that could result in any one of these outcomes, including the potential sale of a portion of our -- all of our data center business. Also as we have said, we could ultimately choose to retain these assets and related operations. 
As we outlined in November, we believe in the macro trends of the data center colocation industry and the importance of the service in our hybrid IT solutions. But we do not believe we must own the colocation facilities to provide the full range of services our customers need to manage their IT functions. We expect to formally engage interested parties within the next 2 weeks or so. 
Continuing on now to Slide 8. As we enter 2016, we thought it might be useful to share with you a broader view of how we think about our business and operational focus for 2016 and beyond. First, I think it's important that we declare for ourselves why we're here, what we are trying to accomplish -- and what we are trying to accomplish as an organization. And for us, that purpose is to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the digital world, whether it's providing connections or services on top of that connection using the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and businesses, is really what we are all about. We expect to accomplish this purpose through a 2-part, mutually reinforcing mission. First, we provide our customers a gateway to the digital world by enabling fast, highly reliable broadband connections that are automated and easy to use. We also have significant opportunity to take a leadership position on this front, and our principal focus going forward will be to provide our customers the very best network experience. 
Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intensive investments, higher-growth solutions to deliver our customers a full range of technology-focused services, such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video, along with over-the-top applications and content. We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services our customers want, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the Network Services offerings that are at the heart of our customer relationships. 
Continuing on Slide 9. Looking at our purpose from a financial point of view, our focus is to create long-term shareholder value through both revenue growth and strong cash flow generation. I want to emphasize this last point. The focus of our business is to drive long-term free cash flow generation that enables us to continue to invest in our business and sustain our strong dividend. And we will prioritize investments and operational initiatives to support that outcome. 
We believe we can accomplish our goals if we focus on 3 key operational initiatives. First, we will maximize market penetration of our network and adjacent services to drive growth. To accomplish this, we plan to maximize penetration in areas where we have invested in and enabled broadband capabilities. We will also continue to focus our investments on enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity. And we will enable other technology-focused solutions such as managed network, hosting, cloud, IT services and video using capital-efficient solutions and partnerships. 
Our second key initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As part of this effort, we plan to simplify our products, our processes and our systems, and we will continue our evolution to a single orchestration layer that automates the end-to-end customer experience that enables access the complementary services from multiple providers. This will take time, but we have a roadmap in place to significantly improve our customer experience over the next couple of years. 
Finally, we deploy a disciplined approach to our operating capital investments to deliver profitable growth, first, by investing more capital to enable high-bandwidth network connectivity and pursuing capital-light investment approaches for a complementary adjacent services. Allocating capital based on the best returns on investment and opportunities in key strategic objectives will be key. We also expect to gain revenue and operating expense efficiencies and improve cash from operations through more aggressive systems consolidation, automation and process improvement. We have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on these operational areas, we will be able to build on CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Finally, we're focused on specific actions to drive sales and revenue growth of our strategic products and service in 2016 and beyond. We expect to drive further penetration of our consumer business and GPON footprint of over 900,000 households and almost 500,000 businesses and our 3 million households enabled for Prism TV service. And we expect to continue to expand high-bandwidth data services, GPON and Prism, enabling further revenue upside opportunities. We also believe we can continue sales momentum from the second half of 2015 and drive increased sales productivity through better go-to-market alignment, leveraging products, specialists and enabling additional sales and sales performance tools. And we plan to focus on winning large deals through dedicated teams and system integration and value-added resellers -- or system integrators and value-added resellers. Expanded distribution partners are the key to hitting our goals and driving this revenue. 
And one final item, I'm sure you saw our release this afternoon, announcing our new president of sales and marketing, a new Chief Marketing Officer. We look forward to Dean Douglas and Bill Hurley joining our team next week, and I'm confident they will be key contributors to helping us achieve the actions I've just discussed. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and liquidity position as well as our guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter, provide an overview of the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my",1224,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter, provide an overview of the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position. Regarding our guidance, we are pleased that our full year expectations for 2016 are in line or better than current average analyst estimates. 
Now moving to Slide 11. I will review a few highlights from our fourth quarter results. Please note that I'll be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieve strong results for the fourth quarter, and operating revenues were $4.48 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.9% increase from fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in high-cost support revenues of approximately $60 million due to the recognition of CAF Phase II support during the fourth quarter 2015, along with strength in high-bandwidth data services and consumer strategic revenues. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.03 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of only 0.5% from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products, including high-speed data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. 
In the fourth quarter, we added approximately 16,000 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers declined about 22,000 during the quarter, partially as a result of tighter credit standards implemented in midyear 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.82 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 40.6%. Cash expenses for the fourth quarter declined to $72 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. And on a sequential quarter basis, cash expenses declined to $115 million or 4.1% from the third quarter of 2015. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income, was 550 -- was $591 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.80. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, as Glen mentioned earlier, we repurchased more than 10 million shares for an investment of nearly $280 million during the fourth quarter, which completed the $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Moving to Slide 12 and our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $43 million or 1.6% from the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 1.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS and Ethernet, partially offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.2% from fourth quarter 2014 due primarily to continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related expenses and CPE cost. Our segment margin was 44.1%, which was an increase from 43.6% a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 13. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $19 million or 1.3% from fourth quarter 2014. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.3% year-over-year to $773 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined only 3.4% from fourth quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses decreased $17 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 14. For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.40 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.95 billion to $4 billion and operating cash flow between $1.66 million and $1.72 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.73. Our anticipated sequential decrease in first quarter operating revenues compared to fourth quarter 2015 is primarily due to declines in legacy, hosting and low-bandwidth data services more than offsetting the anticipated growth in revenues from high-bandwidth data services. We expect first quarter 2016 operating cash flow to be lower than fourth quarter 2015, primarily driven by the decline in revenues I just mentioned, along with higher costs. Those higher costs include approximately $35 million from onetime favorable expense items in the fourth quarter; and in first quarter, $25 million of higher payroll taxes and $20 million related to higher-marketing costs. 
For full year 2016, we expect operating revenues of $17.55 billion to $17.8 billion and core revenues of $17.75 billion (sic) [$15.75 billion] to $16 billion. Both are expected to be slightly lower compared to full year 2015 expected legacy revenue declines more than offsetting anticipated increases in the level of strategic revenue growth. 
Our operating cash flow for the full year 2016 is expected to be $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, lower than full year 2015, primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and low-bandwidth data revenues. The company anticipates lower depreciation and amortization expense for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, and adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2016 is projected to be $2.50 to $2.70. The expected lower full year operating cash flow for 2016, along with higher cash income taxes and anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of $3 billion, are expected to lower free cash flow to $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
Now turning to Slide 15. Since we recently issued $235 million of debt to refinance upcoming maturities, we thought we would provide you with our plans for our maturities over the remainder of the year. Our total debt maturities for 2016 are approximately $1.4 billion. As I mentioned in January, we completed a $235 million debt issuance of 7% Qwest Corp. 40-year notes that will be used to refinance an upcoming May 1 maturity. That primarily leads us with an EMBARQ debt maturity of a little less than $1.2 billion on June 1. We expect to be opportunistic in the coming months in refinancing some or all of that debt as well at the CenturyLink parent level. It's important to note that with approximately $400 million as of -- drawn as of the end of 2015 on our $2 billion credit facility, we have the capacity to handle the June 1 maturity if needed. Additionally, since we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program in early December, we can also use available free cash flow for a portion of the June 1 maturity if necessary. 
As is indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow after the cash dividend, which results in our dividend payout ratio in the low to mid-60% range in 2016, which is very sustainable. So we're confident that our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

For Stewart, just first, number one, as we kind of look at the 2016 guide, obviously, last year, we had an issue with kind of overestimating how the year was going to play out. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about what the base case expectations that you've modeled out for the economy and sales force ramp, and whether your incoming head of revenue, Mr. Douglas, has bought into these expectations, and kind of your comfort level of achievement. That'll be number one. Second would be on the cash tax outlook and kind of the update on bonus tax depreciation, what's embedded in that free cash flow guidance? And then the last one, if I could, would just be on kind of the metered data opportunity. I think we've been seeing a lot of the cable companies experimenting with data caps and metering higher-end usage. It seems like the FCC is not pushing back on this, and it feels like it could be a big opportunity for telcos to, if nothing else, price underneath the cable umbrella and start to raise rates from high-end users. I was wondering if that's something that you guys are looking at as an opportunity and where it stands?"

So David, in terms of 2016 revenue guidance, I mean, I believe we do feel more comfortable with the revenue guidance that we have this year from the guidance that we provided in '15. We think we have some things in place from a sales standpoint. Our funnel continues to build and look good. We have a number of big deals that are in the funnel, and hopefully, we can get to closure with some of those. We're also working on the provisioning, the order to cash, to get the sales that the salespeople make provisioned and into billing quicker and hope to be able to get that done over the course of the next few months to where we can reduce our cycle times there. That will help. The other focus that we have is on churn reduction, so we're working there to try to keep the customers we have and try to make some of the price declines and credits that we've been issuing smaller. So we hope -- we're hopeful that we're attacking revenue, not just from a sales standpoint this year, but also from the standpoint of reducing churn as well as getting the orders into cash quicker. And we've also have a big deal team that, as we've talked about before, that we launched to pursue larger opportunities. In terms of the guidance and the macroeconomic issues, I mean, we basically have assumed that the economy stays about like it is at this point, so no real significant changes there. Glen, I'll let you talk about Dean."

But in terms -- we're going to be so close just in terms of projecting that we're going to hit stability and growth on a sequential basis quarter-after-quarter. It's really not possible for us to do that now, but we think that with the 3-pronged approach that we have to really driving revenue, keeping the revenue we have, getting customers to billing quicker, it will pay dividends for us from the standpoint of getting some real momentum in terms of our revenue growth. In terms of cash taxes, our cash taxes for 2015 were $63 million. Based on the operating income guidance that we provided for 2016, we would expect cash taxes to be approximately $400 million at the low end of guidance and about $600 million at the high end of guidance. And as we say with the free cash flow that, that results in -- after the operating income, you result in the dividend payout ratio being in the low to mid-60s. I might add that dividend payout ratio in 2017, at this point, we would say we would be kind of in the low to mid-70s, because we think that cash taxes will increase somewhat in 2017 just because the impact of bonus depreciation will be less as it matures more."

The -- we average about, right now, just in this early on, we just realized that we got about 15% penetration in our GPON markets of the GPON products. So it's growing. And that's just -- as you know, we rolled out this past year -- most of this rolled out the past year. So we're real pleased with that. And that opportunity gives also, if you look at our market share data, market share in a lot of the cities we're in is very low. We think we have upside there that's going in these businesses. And we're also attach -- or connecting more of the MDUs and MTUs within our markets that we believe will give us a lot of opportunity. We've had very little market share there. 30% -- more than 30% of our households that we serve are in MDUs, so we've -- there's a real market opportunity there as well that we're focused on. So those are some of the things we're doing we believe can really turn around the broadband growth."

Beginning on Slide 6, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, op",1108,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our first quarter results and operational initiatives as well as provide guidance for next quarter. 
Beginning on Slide 6, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share were all in line with our guidance for the quarter. High-bandwidth data services revenue provided to business customers grew more than 7% year-over-year, and consumer strategic service revenues grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Additionally, since the beginning of the year, we successfully placed over $1.2 billion in debt, which we will use primarily to refinance 2016 debt maturities. 
Continuing on Slide 7, we entered 2016 with a renewed focus on our key objective, to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. Whether it's providing network connections or adjacent services on top of that connection, enabling the power of the digital world to improve our customers' live and business, is really what we are all about. Obviously, we are operating in a challenging and quickly evolving industry. Customer expectations are growing. Technology's rapidly advancing and we face strong competition on multiple fronts. But change brings opportunity, and we believe we have the assets, the financial strength and the people necessary to deliver critical broadband capabilities and related services our customers require. Our delivery on this opportunity and our efforts to drive long-term free cash flow growth is anchored in 4 operational objectives. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. First, we expect to maximize market penetration of enabled network and adjacent services. The network is our key strategic advantage and is the foundation of value we deliver to our customers. We will leverage our localized marketing initiatives to drive penetration of the investments we've made to date in GPON and other broadband technology, and we will drive further penetration of our fiber-enabled multitenant commercial buildings in businesses. As of quarter end, we have over 1.5 million fiber-enabled homes and businesses within our net speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. And we provide more than 30% of our addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher, speeds that today in the market is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we remain committed to enhancing our sales through partnerships with major software, computer and technology companies and with our large alternative partner channel. It is also important for us to be more aggressive in our customer and revenue retention efforts as the cost of acquiring new customers is typically much higher than retaining current customers. 
Our second operational initiatives is to create exceptional customer experiences. We have always operated with a customer-centric focus, where we know there are ways to improve our customer experience. Now we're simplifying our product offerings, and within our existing capital program, we are investing to drive higher levels of automation and self-service into our service delivery platforms. We expect the outcome of these improvements to enhance the products and services that we deliver to our customers. We expect them to reduce our overall delivery time frame as well as improve our managed services delivery and service model. 
Continuing on to Slide 9. Our third operational initiatives is to invest with discipline and with a focus on network first. We believe the greatest potential returns of our capital investment are in building and delivering broadband service capacity on our markets. We will focus our investment on enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity to our customers, and we will further enhance our core network access capabilities for consumers with a variety of network enablement techniques, including bonding, vectoring and further deploying fiber-to-the-home. Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intense, higher growth solutions to deliver to our customers a full range of technology-focused services such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video along with over-the-top applications and content. We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services our customers want, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the network service offerings at the heart of our customer relationships. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating and capital efficiencies. We know that our long-term success will require ongoing realignment of our legacy call structure. Realizing those efficiencies and ensuring our capital is aligned to those investments that will drive the highest returns is crucial to driving CenturyLink's future cash flow, our cash flow growth. Through aggressive simplification and automation of our product portfolio and customer experience, not only will we enhance service to our customers. We'll also drive cost out of our business and operate more efficiently. Also, we're focused on increasing the discipline and rigor of our capital allocation process to generate the best returns in our capital and operating investments. An example is the strategic review process currently underway for the data center and colocation business. While we expect colocation services to continue to be a service our customers will look to us for, we believe there's potentially more efficient way to enable these services for our customers. And we have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on our key objectives in these key operational initiatives, we will successfully build CenturyLink's strong foundation to deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 10. There remains tremendous amount of collocation services in both the U.S. market as well as the international markets we operate in. While we like the colocation business, we believe our priority of capital investment is in the network to protect and grow our consumer and business network market position. Therefore, we launched the strategic review process for our data center and colocation business last year. Our strategic review is ongoing. We have received a strong level of interest from numerous strategic and financial parties. We expect to start narrowing this down to a shorter list over the next few weeks, and we expect to finalize the process in late third, early fourth quarter of this year. This strategic review could result in a sale of all or a portion of the data centers. It could result in a partnership with a joint venture as well as possibly keeping these assets as part of CenturyLink portfolio. In all cases, we look for the best way to create accretive value for CenturyLink and our shareholders and continue to provide a strong colocation competitor in the market for our customers. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart to discuss our financial results and guidance and liquidity position. Stewart?"
260149,328991719,972997,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen.

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of second quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position. 
Now moving to Slide 12. I will review a few highlights of our first quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid results for the first quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.1% decrease from first quarter 2015 operating revenues. The decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase and high-cost support revenues due to CAF Phase II higher consumer strategic services and increased high-bandwidth data services revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.98 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.9% from a year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.5% year-over-year primarily driven by strengthened high-speed data revenues, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. In the first quarter, we added approximately 16,900 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers increased nearly 7,800 given the quarter. 
We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.69 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.4%. The cash expenses for the first quarter declined $5 million year-over-year primarily due to lower employee-related cost. 
Starting in the first quarter of 2016, we have revised our free cash flow calculation to include the cash impact of pension and OpEx cost as well pass stock-based compensation. We believe this calculation provides additional detail and insight into the company's ongoing cash requirements. For the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow was $824 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.71, an increase from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2015. Although operating cash flow declined in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015, lower depreciation and the impact of our share buybacks in 2015 resulted in a net increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Moving to Slide 13 in our Business segment. In the first quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $93 million or 3.4% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenue for the segment was flat at $1.58 billion compared to first quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services being offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and hosting revenues. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6 9% from first quarter a year ago due to primarily a continuing decline in voice and switch access revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased $36 million or 2.5% from the year-ago period driven primarily by lower employee-related cost. 
Now turning to Slide 14. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a slight decrease of $8 million or 0.5% from first quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 4.9% year-over-year to $774 million driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. 
Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 5.8% from first quarter 2015 as voice revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.6% compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to higher Prism TV content cost and marketing expenses. 
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 15. For the second quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.38 billion to $4.43 billion; core revenues of $3.94 billion to $3.99 billion; and operating cash flow between $1.59 billion to $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.62. Second quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be in line with first quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected declines in legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenues. 
Our anticipated sequential decrease in second quarter operating cash flow compared to first quarter 2016 is primarily due to expected higher seasonal cash expenses. For full year 2016, we will remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although continued pressure on business strategic revenues and our decision to defer certain price increases will likely result in our core and total revenue coming in toward the lower half of our range for the year than we previously provided. 
Now turning to Slide 16. And as we discussed last quarter, our liquidity position remains very strong. Since the beginning of the year, we've completed debt issuances for a total of over $1.2 billion, which will be used to refinance substantially all of our 2016 maturities. Our 2017 maturities are comparable to the amount in 2016, and as you can see, the following 3 years maturities are materially lower. 
As indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow, which should result in our dividend payout ratio for full year 2016 to be in the low to mid-60% range. So our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes the prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

So, Simon, yes, if you take our first quarter actual results and the midpoint of second quarter guidance, you'll see that if you leave in the annual guidance where it is, you'll see that we would require to have revenue growth in the last half of this year to be able to get to the midpoint guidance. So we think we'll be in the bottom half of guidance based on the things I mentioned. In terms of the business strategic revenues, we've seen some weakness in MPLS revenues as well as our hosting revenues. We expect to be able to turn that around and grow these revenue streams later in the year. But at this point, based on where we are, we think that we need to give you guidance that -- or indicate that will be towards the lower half of the guidance. The other part, I guess, is that the price increases. Some of the increases that we are going to put in place, probably in the $40 million range, we have decided at least to defer at this point. We're still talking about them, but we feel it's fair to call that out as possibility that we'll not implement those increases. Some of our products for those, they were really across the board, but mostly directed towards high-speed Internet or facility charges and things of that nature."

Some of the pressures that we're facing in the business have to do with a slight adjustment in strategy, for example, in high-speed Internet, where what we did was we pivoted from a -- approach that with pure broadband to one that was more traditional bundled broadband. We did that in a lot of parts of fiscal year '15, and so we're starting to work through what that means in the first part of fiscal year '16. And we expect that, that will continue to work through through the middle part of the year of fiscal year '16. But that pivot to the more traditional approach to high-speed bandwidth in the Consumer segment especially should allow us to have customers that have less precluded to churn and a higher ARPU. So we think that, that's going to -- something that we're going to benefit from in the second half of the year and into 2017. On the high-speed -- I'm sorry, the MPLS circuits and Ethernet circuits for business marketplace, we are actually doing pretty well with that. In the first quarter, it's generally slower than we see in second quarter and other parts, the other quarters throughout the year. And we saw that once again in the first quarter this year. Having said that, we did focus on driving our business and market approach from an enterprise standpoint to really take advantage of opportunities that we think are much near term, and so we're focused on the near-term opportunities. And you should start to see those near-term opportunities manifest themselves in the second half."

And so we expect that to -- that business to recover as I mentioned in the second half of the year, because we'll still see some marketing spend and investment in marketing that we need to do to drive that broadband business.

It appears that the FCC is seeking to impose additional price regulation on the industry as well as redefining what constitutes a competitive market between the market participants. The most concerning financial issue in the proceeding is we appreciated at this point, is the potential imposition of a productivity factor or an X factor that could require CenturyLink to lower its special access rates on an annual basis. We believe the market for high-bandwidth data services is highly competitive as evidenced by the fact that we're not getting all the special access that's going away and converting to Ethernet. The cable companies get some, the other fiber companies get some, Felix get some, so there's plenty of competition. We don't believe that heavy-handed regulation included an arbitrary market and bandwidth definitions as well as on more price regulation. We think that, that alone will serve to just hinder further investment in broadband, especially in rural areas, where it's tough to make the investment work anyway.

Just to give you an example that, Frank, if you look at where we have a GPON investment last year or so, we've got 20% penetration already and those GPON markets have been there for several months.

So that traditional high-speed Internet services are really what you'd expect in a double-play or Triple Play. So it's not only a high speed, but it's also video and some voice technology as well. And so that's pretty much a typical broadband suite of services. When you look at the present after we did in the first quarter of this year, 53% [ph] of them were with new customers. So you're now starting to see services like Prism track new customers that were not customers of CenturyLink, and they're dragging along broadband services with that video play. So 98% of those customers that signed up for Prism in the first quarter also signed up for our broadband services. And so we see in those markets that bundling the technologies, broadband, video and the like, really do provide a much more compelling offering for both our customer base as well as our folks that were with either competitors or didn't have service at all, but nonetheless were not customers of CenturyLink. And so as we think about how we go forward to the marketplace, we obviously do a lot of competitive analysis. So I would tell you that our ARPU are very consistent with what you see from an in ARPU level in our competitors. And we see competition adding a lot of fees and so that's where there might be a little bit of a Delta, but we're working through and constantly monitoring what our competitors are doing in the marketplace with regard to the average ARPUs in our business. The fiber deployment, well, we talked about fiber deployments, 1.5 million homes passed from a fiber standpoint. But vectoring and bonding does provide a compelling level of service for many of our customers, especially those that don't have access to fiber or where they really don't need the speed of fiber. And so there's obviously an economic equation there for those customers, but also, it's 40 megabytes, sufficient enough to get Prism services and to do a lot of broadband activity that they're going to need in the consumer space especially. And so they should be very, very comfortable with what we have to offer, and I think they are comfortable with what we have to offer when we do the vectoring and the bonding in order to provide them high-speed broadband access."

Beginning on Slide 6, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, op",1108,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our first quarter results and operational initiatives as well as provide guidance for next quarter. 
Beginning on Slide 6, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share were all in line with our guidance for the quarter. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue provided to business customers grew more than 7% year-over-year, and consumer strategic service revenues grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Additionally, since the beginning of the year, we successfully placed over $1.2 billion in debt, which we will use primarily to refinance 2016 debt maturities. 
Continuing on Slide 7, we entered 2016 with a renewed focus on our key objective: ""To improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world,"" whether it's providing network connections or adjacent services on top of that connection, enabling the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and business, is really what we are all about. Obviously, we are operating in a challenging and quickly evolving industry. Customer expectations are growing. Technology is rapidly advancing and we face strong competition on multiple fronts. But change brings opportunity, and we believe we have the assets, the financial strength and the people necessary to deliver critical broadband capabilities and related services our customers require. Our delivery on this opportunity and our efforts to drive long-term free cash flow growth is anchored in 4 operational objectives. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. First, we expect to maximize market penetration of enabled network and adjacent services. The network is our key strategic advantage and is the foundation of value we deliver to our customers. We will leverage our localized marketing initiatives to drive penetration of the investments we've made to date in GPON and other broadband technology, and we will drive further penetration of our fiber-enabled multitenant commercial buildings and businesses. As of quarter-end, we have over 1.5 million fiber-enabled homes and businesses within our net speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. And we provide more than 30% of our addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher, a speed that today in the market is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we remain committed to enhancing our sales through partnerships with major software, computer and technology companies and with our large alternative partner channel. It is also important for us to be more aggressive in our customer and revenue retention efforts as the cost of acquiring new customers is typically much higher than retaining current customers. 
Our second operational initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. We have always operated with a customer-centric focus, where we know there are ways we can improve our customer experience. Now we're simplifying our product offerings, and with our existing capital program, we're investing to drive higher levels of automation and self-service into our service delivery platforms. We expect the outcome of these improvements to enhance the products and services that we deliver to our customers. We expect them to reduce our overall delivery time frame as well as improve our managed services delivery and service model. 
Continuing on to Slide 9. Our third operational initiative is to invest with discipline and with a focus on network first. We believe the greatest potential returns on our capital investment are in building and delivering broadband service capacity on our markets. We will focus our investment on enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity to our customers, and we will further enhance our core network access capabilities for consumers with a variety of network enablement techniques, including bonding, vectoring and further deploying fiber-to-the-home. Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intense, higher-growth solutions to deliver our customers a full range of technology-focused services such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video along with over-the-top applications and content. We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services our customers want, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the network service offerings at the heart of our customer relationships. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating and capital efficiencies. We know that our long-term success will require ongoing realignment of our legacy call structure. Realizing those efficiencies and ensuring our capital is aligned to those investments that will drive the highest returns is crucial to driving CenturyLink's future cash flow, our cash flow growth, through aggressive simplification and automation of our product portfolio and customer experience. Not only will we enhance service to our customers, we'll also drive cost out of our business and operate more efficiently. Also, we're focused on increasing the discipline and rigor of our capital allocation process to generate the best returns in our capital and operating investments. An example is the strategic review process currently underway for the data center and colocation business. While we expect colocation services to continue to be a service our customers will look to us for, we believe there's potentially more efficient ways to enable these services for our customers. And we have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on our key objectives in these key operational initiatives, we will successfully build CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 10. There remains tremendous amount of colocation services in both the U.S. market as well as the international markets we operate in. While we like the colocation business, we believe our priority for capital investments is in the network to protect and grow our consumer and business network market position. Therefore, we launched the strategic review process for our data center and colocation business last year. Our strategic review is ongoing. We have received a strong level of interest from numerous strategic and financial parties. We expect to start narrowing this down to a shorter list over the next few weeks, and we expect to finalize the process in late third, early fourth quarter of this year. This strategic review could result in a sale of all or a portion of our data centers. It could result in a partnership with a joint venture as well as possibly keeping these assets as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. In all cases, we look for the best way to create accretive value for CenturyLink and our shareholders and continue to provide a strong colocation competitor in the market for our customers. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart to discuss our financial results and guidance and liquidity position. Stewart?"
260149,328991719,973245,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of second quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion",919,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of second quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position. 
Now moving to Slide 12. I will review a few highlights from our first quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid results for the first quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.1% decrease from first quarter 2015 operating revenues. The decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in high-cost support revenues due to CAF Phase 2 higher consumer strategic services and increased high-bandwidth data services revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.98 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.9% from a year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.5% year-over-year primarily driven by strengthened high-speed data revenues, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. In the first quarter, we added approximately 16,900 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers increased nearly 7,800 during the quarter. 
We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.69 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.4%. The cash expenses for the first quarter declined $5 million year-over-year primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
Starting in the first quarter of 2016, we have revised our free cash flow calculation to include the cash impact of pension and OPEB costs as well as stock-based compensation. We believe this calculation provides additional detail and insight into the company's ongoing cash requirements. For the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow was $824 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.71, an increase from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2015. Although operating cash flow declined in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015, lower depreciation and the impact of our share buybacks in 2015 resulted in a net increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Moving to Slide 13 in our Business segment. In the first quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $93 million or 3.4% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenue for the segment was flat at $1.58 billion compared to first quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, being offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and hosting revenues. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.9% from first quarter a year ago due to primarily a continuing decline in voice and switch access revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased $36 million or 2.5% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a slight decrease of $8 million or 0.5% from first quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 4.9% year-over-year to $774 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. 
Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 5.8% from first quarter 2015 as voice revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.6% compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to higher Prism TV content costs and marketing expenses. 
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 15. For the second quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.38 billion to $4.43 billion; core revenues of $3.94 billion to $3.99 billion; and operating cash flow between $1.59 billion to $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.62. Second quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be in line with first quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected declines in legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenues. 
Our anticipated sequential decrease in second quarter operating cash flow compared to first quarter 2016 is primarily due to expected higher seasonal cash expenses. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although continued pressure on business strategic revenues and our decision to defer certain price increases will likely result in our core and total revenue coming in toward the lower half of our range for the year than we previously provided. 
Now turning to Slide 16. And as we discussed last quarter, our liquidity position remains very strong. Since the beginning of the year, we've completed debt issuances for a total of over $1.2 billion, which will be used to refinance substantially all of our 2016 maturities. Our 2017 maturities are comparable to the amount in 2016, and as you can see, the following 3 years maturities are materially lower. 
As indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow, which should result in our dividend payout ratio for full year 2016 to be in the low to mid-60% range. So our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

So, Simon, yes, if you take our first quarter actual results and the midpoint of second quarter guidance, you'll see that if you leave in the annual guidance where it is, you'll see that we would require to have revenue growth in the last half of the year to be able to get to the midpoint guidance. So we think we'll be in the bottom half of guidance based on the things I mentioned. In terms of the business strategic revenues, we've seen some weakness in MPLS revenues as well as our hosting revenues. We expect to be able to turn that around and grow these revenue streams later in the year. But at this point, based on where we are, we think that we need to give you guidance that -- or indicate that it'll be towards the lower half of the guidance. The other part, I guess, is that the price increases. Some of the increases that we're going to put in place, probably in the $40 million range, we've decided at least to defer at this point.

Some of the pressures that we're facing in the business have to do with a slight adjustment in strategy, for example, in high-speed Internet realm. What we did was we pivoted from an approach that was pure broadband to one that is more traditional bundled broadband. We did that in the latter part of fiscal year '15, and so we're starting to work through what that means in the first part of fiscal year '16. And we expect that, that will continue to work through the middle part of the year of fiscal year '16. But that pivot to the more traditional approach to high-speed bandwidth, in the Consumer segment especially, should allow us to have customers that have less proclivity to churn and a higher ARPU. So we think that, that's going to be something that we're going to benefit from in the second half of the year and into 2017. On the high-speed -- I'm sorry, the MPLS circuits and the Ethernet circuits for the business marketplace, we actually are doing pretty well with that. In the first quarter, it's generally slower than we see in the second quarter and other parts -- or other quarters throughout the year. And we saw that once again in the first quarter this year. Having said that, we did focus on driving our business and market approach from an enterprise standpoint to really take advantage of opportunities that we think are much nearer term, and so we're focused on those nearer-term opportunities.

And so as we do that, we've moved the marketing funds from focused on pure broadband to taking on the more traditional broadband or bundled broadband kind of services. And so we expect that to -- that business to recover as I mentioned in the second half of the year, because we'll still see some marketing spend and investment in marketing that we need to do to drive that broadband business. So we're seeing it flat sequentially, but we don't think that the business is going to be flat sequentially based upon where we're focused and the drive we have. And as I mentioned, and I'll reiterate, it does drive a churn model that's significantly lower than the churn model that we would see in the pure broadband.

So this week, the FCC concluded its special access tariff investigation on -- and really, that will have a minimal financial impact and, in fact, tariff impacts to this as well. And of course, they opened a special access notice for full rules making that could potentially impose more regulations, special access pricing, terms and conditions. It appears that the FCC is seeking to impose additional price regulation on the industry as well as redefining what constitutes a competitive market between the market participants. The most concerning financial issue in the proceeding, as we appreciated at this point, is the potential imposition of a productivity factor or an X factor that could require CenturyLink to lower its special access rates on an annual basis. We believe the market for high-bandwidth data services is highly competitive as evidenced by the fact that we're not getting all the special access that's going away and converting to Ethernet. The cable companies get some, the other fiber companies get some, CLEC gets some, so there's plenty of competition. We don't believe that heavy-handed regulation included an arbitrary market and bandwidth definitions as well as on more price regulation. We think that, that will only serve to just hinder further investment in broadband, especially in rural areas, where it's tough to make the investment work anyway.

So the traditional high-speed Internet services are really what you'd expect in a double play or triple play. So it's not only a high speed, but it's also video and some voice technology as well. And so that's pretty much a typical broadband suite of services. When you look at the Prism ads that we did in the first quarter of this year, 53% of them were with new customers. And so you're now starting to see services like Prism attract new customers that were not customers of CenturyLink, and they're dragging along broadband services with that video play. So 98% of those customers that signed up for Prism in the first quarter also signed up for our broadband services. And so we see in those markets that bundling the technologies, broadband, video and the like, really do provide a much more compelling offering for both our customer base as well as our -- the folks that were with either competitors or didn't have the service at all, but nonetheless were not customers of CenturyLink. And so as we think about how we go forward with -- to the marketplace, we obviously do a lot of competitive analysis. So I would tell you that our ARPUs are consistent with what you'd see from an ARPU level in our competitors. And we see competition adding a lot of fees, and so that's where there might be a little bit of a delta. But we're working through and constantly monitoring what our competitors are doing in the marketplace with regard to the average ARPUs in our business. The fiber deployment, well, we talked about fiber deployments, 1.5 million homes passed from a fiber standpoint. But vectoring and bonding does provide a compelling level of service for many of our customers, especially those that don't have access to fiber or where they really don't need the speed of fiber. And so there's obviously an economic equation there for those customers, but also it's, at 40 megabytes, sufficient enough to get Prism services and to do a lot of broadband activity that they're going to need in the consumer space especially. And so they should be very, very comfortable with what we have to offer, and I think they are comfortable with what we have to offer when we do the vectoring and the bonding in order to provide them high-speed broadband access."

Beginning on Slide 6, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, op",1107,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our first quarter results and operational initiatives as well as provide guidance for next quarter. 
Beginning on Slide 6, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share were all in line with our guidance for the quarter. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue provided to business customers grew more than 7% year-over-year, and consumer strategic service revenues grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Additionally, since the beginning of the year, we successfully placed over $1.2 billion in debt, which we will use, primarily, to refinance 2016 debt maturities. 
Continuing on Slide 7, we entered 2016 with a renewed focus on our key objective: ""To improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world,"" whether it's providing network connections or adjacent services on top of that connection, enabling the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and business is, really, what we are all about. Obviously, we are operating in a challenging and quickly evolving industry. Customer expectations are growing. Technology is rapidly advancing and we face strong competition on multiple fronts. But change brings opportunity, and we believe we have the assets, the financial strength and the people necessary to deliver critical broadband capabilities and related services our customers require. Our delivery on this opportunity and our efforts to drive long-term free cash flow growth is anchored in 4 operational objectives. 
Continuing on to Slide 8. First, we expect to maximize market penetration of enabled network and adjacent services. The network is our key strategic advantage and is the foundation of value we deliver to our customers. We will leverage our localized marketing initiatives to drive penetration of the investments we've made to date in GPON and other broadband technology, and we will drive further penetration of our fiber-enabled multitenant commercial buildings and businesses. As of quarter-end, we have over 1.5 million fiber-enabled homes and businesses with Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. And we provide more than 30% of our addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher, a speed that today in the market is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we remain committed to enhancing our sales through partnerships with major software, computer and technology companies and with our large alternative partner channel. It is also important for us to be more aggressive in our customer and revenue retention efforts as the cost of acquiring new customers is, typically, much higher than retaining current customers. 
Our second operational initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. We have always operated with a customer-centric focus, but we know there are ways we can improve our customer experience. Now we're simplifying our product offerings, and within our existing capital programs we're investing to drive higher levels of automation and self-service into our service delivery platforms. We expect the outcome of these improvements to enhance the products and services that we deliver to our customers. We expect them to reduce our overall delivery time frames as well as improve our managed services delivery and service model. 
Continuing on to Slide 9. Our third operational initiative is to invest with discipline and with a focus on network first. We believe the greatest potential returns on our capital investment are in building and delivering broadband service capacity on our markets. We will focus our investment on enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity to our customers, and we will further enhance our core network access capabilities for consumers with a variety of network enablement techniques, including bonding, vectoring and further deploying fiber-to-the-home. Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intense, higher-growth solutions to deliver our customers a full range of technology-focused services such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video along with over-the-top applications and content. We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services our customers want, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the network service offerings at the heart of our customer relationships. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating and capital efficiencies. We know that our long-term success will require ongoing realignment of our legacy cost structure. Realizing those efficiencies and ensuring our capital is aligned to those investments that will drive the highest returns is crucial to driving CenturyLink's future cash flow -- our cash flow growth. Through aggressive simplification and automation of our product portfolio and customer experience, not only will we enhance service to our customers, we'll also drive cost out of our business and operate more efficiently. Also, we're focused on increasing the discipline and rigor of our capital allocation process to generate the best returns on our capital and operating investments. An example is the strategic review process currently underway for the data center and colocation business. While we expect colocation services to continue to be a service our customers will look to us for, we believe there's, potentially, more efficient ways to enable these services for our customers. And we have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on our key objectives and these key operational initiatives we will successfully build CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 10. There remains tremendous demand for colocation services in both the U.S. market as well as the international markets we operate in. While we like the colocation business, we believe our priority for capital investments is in the network to protect and grow our consumer and business network market position. Therefore, we launched the strategic review process for our data center and colocation business last year. Our strategic review is ongoing. We have received a strong level of interest from numerous strategic and financial parties. We expect to start narrowing this down to a shorter list over the next few weeks, and we expect to finalize the process in late third, early fourth quarter of this year. This strategic review could result in a sale of all or a portion of the data centers. It could result in a partnership or joint venture as well as possibly keeping these assets as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. In all cases, we look for the best way to create accretive value for CenturyLink and our shareholders and continue to provide a strong colocation competitor in the market for our customers. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart to discuss our financial results and guidance and liquidity position. Stewart?"
260149,328991719,973327,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of second quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion",919,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of second quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position. 
Now moving to Slide 12. I will review a few highlights from our first quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing the results excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid results for the first quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.1% decrease from first quarter 2015 operating revenues. The decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in high-cost support revenues due to CAF Phase II higher consumer strategic services and increased high-bandwidth data services revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.98 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.9% from a year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.5% year-over-year primarily driven by strength in high-speed data revenues, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. In the first quarter, we added approximately 16,900 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers increased nearly 7,800 during the quarter. 
We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.69 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.4%. The cash expenses for the first quarter declined $5 million year-over-year primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
Starting in the first quarter of 2016, we have revised our free cash flow calculation to include the cash impact of pension and OPEB costs as well as stock-based compensation. We believe this calculation provides additional detail and insight into the company's ongoing cash requirements. For first quarter of 2016, free cash flow was $824 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.71, an increase from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2015. Although operating cash flow declined in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015, lower depreciation and the impact of our share buybacks in 2015 resulted in a net increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Moving to Slide 13 in our Business segment. In the first quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $93 million or 3.4% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenue for the segment was flat at $1.58 billion compared to first quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services being offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and hosting revenues. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.9% from first quarter a year ago due to, primarily, a continuing decline in voice and switched access revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased $36 million or 2.5% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related costs. 
Now turning to Slide 14. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a slight decrease of $8 million or 0.5% from first quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 4.9% year-over-year to $774 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. 
Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 5.8% from first quarter 2015 as voice revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.6% compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to higher Prism TV content cost and marketing expenses. 
Now turning to our guidance on Slide 15. For the second quarter 2016, we expect: operating revenues of $4.38 billion to $4.43 billion; core revenues of $3.94 billion to $3.99 billion; and operating cash flow between $1.59 billion to $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.62. Second quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be in line with first quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected declines in legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenues. 
Our anticipated sequential decrease in second quarter operating cash flow compared to first quarter 2016 is primarily due to expected higher seasonal cash expenses. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although continued pressure on business strategic revenues and our decision to defer certain price increases will likely result in our core and total revenue coming in toward the lower half of our range for the year than we previously provided. 
Now turning to Slide 16. And as we discussed last quarter, our liquidity position remains very strong. Since the beginning of the year, we've completed debt issuances for a total of over $1.2 billion, which will be used to refinance substantially all of our 2016 maturities. Our 2017 maturities are comparable to the amount in 2016, and as you can see, the following 3 years maturities are materially lower. 
As indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow, which should result in our dividend payout ratio for full year 2016 to be in the low to mid-60% range. So our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. 
That concludes the prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call."

So, Simon, yes, if you take our first quarter actual results and the midpoint of second quarter guidance, you'll see that if you -- leaving the annual guidance where it is, you'll see that we would require to have revenue growth in the last half of the year to be able to get to the midpoint of guidance. So we think we'll be in the bottom half of guidance based on the things I mentioned. In terms of the business strategic revenues, we've seen some weakness in MPLS revenues as well as our hosting revenues. We expect to be able to turn that around and grow these revenue streams later in the year. But at this point, based on where we are, we think that we need to give you guidance that -- or indicate that will be towards the lower half of the guidance. The other part, I guess, is that the price increases -- some of the increases that we were going to put in place, probably in the $40 million range, we've decided at least to defer at this point.

Some of the pressures that we're facing in the business have to do with a slight adjustment in strategy, for example, in the high-speed Internet realm. What we did was we pivoted from an approach that was pure broadband to one that is more traditional bundled broadband. We did that in the latter part of fiscal year '15, and so we're starting to work through what that means in the first part of fiscal year '16. And we expect that, that will continue to work through the middle part of the year of fiscal year '16. But that pivot to the more traditional approach to high-speed bandwidth, in the Consumer segment especially, should allow us to have customers that have less proclivity to churn and a higher ARPU. So we think that that's going to be something that we're going to benefit from in the second half of the year and into 2017. On the high-speed -- or I'm sorry, the MPLS circuits and the Ethernet circuits for the business marketplace, we actually are doing pretty well with that. In the first quarter, it's generally slower than we see in the second quarter and other parts -- or other quarters throughout the year. And we saw that once again in the first quarter this year. Having said that, we did focus on driving our business and market approach from an enterprise standpoint to really take advantage of opportunities that we think are much nearer term, and so we're focused on those nearer-term opportunities.

If you could kind of walk us through this -- kind of these line items and tell us where all these big changes are conceivably coming from, I think it would give people a little more conviction about what's supposed to happen next quarter. And then, longer term, obviously one of the big questions a lot of people have is a couple of years ago, you guys were looking into the future, saw mid-80% types of payout ratios in your future as a full cash taxpayer, and you decided to cut the dividend. And people are doing the math now. They're looking into the future. They're seeing bonus tax depreciation reverse and payouts going at least into the mid-70s.

In terms of the increase in the strategic services and what that implies, basically, a fair amount of that is due to rate increases that we've put in and expect to put in, in the second quarter of the year.

And so we expect that to -- that business to recover as I mentioned in the second half of the year, because we'll still see some marketing spend and investment in marketing that we need to do to drive that broadband business. So we're seeing it flat sequentially, but we don't think that the business is going to be flat sequentially based upon where we're focused and the drive we have. And as I mentioned, and I'll reiterate, it does drive a churn model that's significantly lower than the churn model that we would see in the pure broadband.

So this week, the FCC concluded its special access tariff investigation on -- and really, that will have a minimal financial impact and, in fact, tariff impacts to us as well. And of course, they opened a special access notice for full rules making that could potentially impose more regulations, special access pricing, terms and conditions. It appears that the FCC is seeking to impose additional price regulation on the industry as well as redefining what constitutes a competitive market between the market participants. The most concerning financial issue in the proceeding, as we appreciate at this point, is the potential imposition of a productivity factor or an X factor that could require CenturyLink to lower its special access rates on an annual basis. We believe the market for high-bandwidth data services is highly competitive as evidenced by the fact that we're not getting all the special access that's going away and converting to Ethernet. The cable companies get some, the other fiber companies get some, CLECs get some, so there's plenty of competition. We don't believe that heavy-handed regulation including an arbitrary market and bandwidth definitions as well as unwarranted price regulation. We think that, that will only serve to just hinder further investment in broadband, especially in rural areas, where it's tough to make the investment work anyway.

So the traditional high-speed Internet services are really what you'd expect in a double play or triple play. So it's not only a high speed, but it's also video and some voice technology as well. And so that's pretty much a typical broadband suite of services. When you look at the Prism adds that we did in the first quarter of this year, 53% of them were with new customers. And so you're now starting to see services like Prism attract new customers that were not customers of CenturyLink, and they're dragging along broadband services with that video play. So 98% of those customers that signed up for Prism in the first quarter also signed up for our broadband services. And so we see in those markets that bundling the technologies, broadband, video and the like, really do provide a much more compelling offering for both our customer base as well as our -- the folks that were with either competitors or didn't have the service at all, but nonetheless were not customers of CenturyLink. And so as we think about how we go forward with -- to the marketplace, we obviously do a lot of competitive analysis.

And we see competition adding a lot of fees, and so that's where there might be a little bit of a delta. But we're working through and constantly monitoring what our competitors are doing in the marketplace with regard to the average ARPUs in our business. The fiber deployment, well, we talked about fiber deployment, 1.5 million homes passed from a fiber standpoint. But vectoring and bonding does provide a compelling level of service for many of our customers, especially those that don't have access to fiber or where they really don't need the speed of fiber. And so there's obviously an economic equation there for those customers, but also it's, at 40 megabytes, sufficient enough to get Prism services and to do a lot of broadband activity that they're going to need in the consumer space, especially. And so they should be very, very comfortable with what we have to offer, and I think they are comfortable with what we have to offer when we do the vectoring and the bonding in order to provide them high-speed broadband access."

As we begin on Slide 6, we had solid second quarter 2016 financial results. Our total revenue and core revenue were in line with our guidance. We also did a good job managing our expenses during the quarter, which resulted in operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. We continue to see good demand for our high-bandwidth data services from our business customers as revenue grew more than 8% year-over-year. And we grew consumer strategic service revenue approximately 5.5%. So overall, a very good quarter financially. On the other hand, our subscriber results were below our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail a little later in the call. 
One last front before we leave the overview, the strategic review process for our colocation business continues to move forward. And while we have work left to do, we remain optimistic about the level of interest and prospects for a positive outcome. Now we expect to finalize this process in the late third quarter to early fourth quarter time frame. As we said previously, our principal focus is on the sale of all our portion of the data center, but we also have other alternatives should our process not result in a sale. We believe these are valuable assets and we are committed to realizing that value for CenturyLink and our shareholders while continuing to provide a strong colocation service offering for our customers. 
Now let's turn to a discussion of our operational focus and financial results. Continuing to Slide 7. As I shared with you last quarter, CenturyLink entered 2016 with a renewed focus on improving the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. This is an important reminder that our principal operational focus: Providing our customers the network connection and related services they need to power their lives, their businesses in their communities. We will continue to provide a range of hosting, cloud, IT and managed services to our business customers, and video and other services to our consumer customers. Our success in growing these service, though, is tied to our enabling and delivering excellent network connection. And we are focused on 4 key operational initiatives to drive achievement of that key objective. 
So as you move to Slide 8, first, we are focused on driving penetration in the existing network and adjacent capabilities. The network is the foundation of the value we deliver to our customers, and we believe maximizing penetration of enabled network capabilities is critical to our success. This initiative is really about execution. We have enabled a great deal of capability in our network and we have to drive higher sustained levels of market penetration earned and attractive return on that investment. We're seeing some positive results on this front as both business and consumer data revenues grew during the quarter and we have achieved over 21% penetration of our year end 2015 GPON-enabled addressable units. The 8% growth we saw in business high-bandwidth data services was a strong -- was a result of strong growth and Ethernet and MPLS services in the second quarter of 2016. We believe these trends validate the value and relevance of our service offering and we are working hard to extended improve. 
For example, in the Business segment, our new sales and marketing leadership team has refined our customer base to be more tightly retargeted customer group in key verticals and is tailoring the Street product and go-to-market strategies for each group and vertical. We believe this will improve our business customer engagement and drive greater sales execution. 
We're also expanding the scope of our partnership channels to drive more sales through partnerships and major software technology companies. On the consumer side, we're continuing to pivot towards the sale of higher speed, higher-value bundle offerings to better credit quality customers. These customers have a higher ARPU, lower churn and a much higher lifetime value than lower speeds, lower credit, standalone broadband customers. We believe this is the right approach to long-term health of our business, even though it does have an impact on broadband units, some of which we saw during the second quarter. 
As I referenced earlier during the second quarter, our high-speed data customers declined over 65,000. I'd like to make a couple of comments about those results. These broadband additions for the quarter were below our expectations driven, we believe in part, by our focus on acquiring higher-value bundled customers and less emphasis on standalone broadband customers. We did expect broadband additions to be affected by the pivot away from the standalone broadband customers, but the impact was greater than we anticipated. From an [indiscernible] standpoint, about 20% of the decline was driven by higher-than-expected number of slow and non-paying customer churn. A significant percentage of the churn is related to standalone broadband customers who are less loyal than our traditional bundled customers. Also, there are underlying indicators of strength in the market as we have seen in a continued increase in the number of net ads of afforded [ph] megabits and higher speeds, which we expect to deliver future benefits to lower churn and higher ARPU. We expect unit trends to improve in the second half of the year as effects of the changes in our go-to-market and customer retention programs begin to take effect. 
Moving now to investing with discipline in the network-first focus. As I said earlier, we believe the best potential to grow our business is to focus on enabling and delivering fast, reliable technologically-advanced broadband access and related services. During the second quarter of 2016, we continue to expand our capabilities. We believe we have enabled one of the largest deployments of software-defined networking SDN and network function virtualization, NFV capabilities in the market. These technologies allow us to provide fast network functionality and deliver much more efficiently than traditional deployments. 
Also in late June, we announced the launch of our CenturyLink SD-WAN software-defined wide area networking service. Today, we have dozens of customers and proof-of-concept trials and working with over 100 potential sales opportunities, and we will continue to invest to build this type of intelligence and efficiency into our broadband access network. 
From a broadband access standpoint, I want to take a few minutes to discuss our network evolution plan with you. What we think it takes to be competitive where we are today and our plans to ensure we are keeping pace in both the customer demand and competitive market. First, I want to make a point about speed in [indiscernible]. Our view is that we should always enable the highest speed that technology and market economics allow. We put fiber everywhere it makes sense to do so. But we also believe our access technologies such as vectoring, bonding and G.fast deliver market-competitive speeds when the cost of fiber deployment becomes prohibitive. 
Let me walk you through some of those numbers when we move to Slide 9. What you see here is an estimate of the bandwidth requirements of what we would describe as a heavy usage consumer customer: A household streaming 6 streams of HD video, including 2 streams of 4K video; a group HD call, 'a couple of HD gamers, multiple bit torrent downloads; and multiple music stream. As you can see, even in this relatively high usage case, which is well beyond the vast majority of users' activity, can be met with speeds of less than 100 megabits. And that allows in our own experience, we see speeds of 40 megabits to 100 megabits as competitive today in virtually all of our market. We expect that usage curve to continue to increase over time, moving to the 100 megabits and 200 megabits range over the next several years. A service that we will use to seek the gigabit connection, but for the vast majority of consumers, we see 100 megabits to 200 megabits is being more than sufficient to meet market demand for a number of years. 
With that in mind, let's move to Slide 10 and take a look at where we are today with the broadband speed deployment, where our access enablement plan takes us over the next several years. We're confident we can accomplish this broadband speeds within the confines of our existing capital budget level, and this is based on currently available compression and access technologies and average cost of deployment, which we hope will improve over time. By year-end 2018, we expect to enable speeds of greater than 40 megabits to 85% of our top 25 markets, and to reach more than 55% of those markets with more than 100 megabits will allow that improvement coming over the next 12 to 18 months. And while not depicted on this chart across all of our markets, this will represent about 50% [ph] of addressable units receiving 40 megabits and higher speeds and more than 30% of addressable units receiving 100 megabits and higher speeds by year-end 2018. By the time we get to year-end 2019,  we'll have almost -- we expect to have almost 11 -- or about 11 million addressable units, representing 42% of total addressable units across all of our markets capable of receiving 100 megabits and higher. And in our top 25 markets, over 70% [ph] of addressable units expect to have 100 megabits in higher speed. By this time, we also expect to have approximately 3 million addressable units enabled for 1 gigabit and higher speeds across all of our markets. Obviously, changes in technology, cost of deployment and market factors will call us to reassess or actual deployment to keep a little lower, a little higher, but while the details may vary, the point is we believe we can deploy very competitive speeds than our existing capital plan. While our investment plan assume capital intensity at current levels, for the next several years, we do anticipate our capital intensity to return to historical averages over time. 
Let's move to Slide 11. Our next operational initiative is to exceptional customer experiences as enabled speeds become more aligned and more competitors are more consistently in excess of the customer's needs, we believe customer experience becomes more relevant to the buying decision. Under our new sales and marketing leadership, we're intensifying our efforts to go-to-market with a customer-focused approach. For example, we're in the process of reducing the many variations of one of our consumer products. This result in fewer easy-to-understand and easy-to-envision offerings. This will improve our customer experience and efficiencies into our operations. We've also continued to enhance efforts to accelerate provisioning of our business network services and we've seen a 25% improvement in Ethernet service intervals since the first of this year and increased order velocity by approximately 60%. Again, this improvement drives a better customer experience, drive efficiencies in their operations and it celebrates the order to cash cycle.  
Finally, we've increased the level of focus in our call centers in first call resolution for our customers. Now this focus on first call resolution is another change we believe may have affected our broadband additions for the quarter as we focus more on the customer issues rather than selling, but we believe improve customer experience will improve customer retention and improve revenue over time. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating capital and capital efficiencies. We know we have to continue to realign our legacy cost structure. I think, our operating expenses for the second quarter showed that we are focused on operating efficiencies. Now we have realized the level of efficiencies we require will take more than just good cost management and we have several initiatives underway to drive even greater efficiencies. We simplified our product offerings. We are also in the process to simplifying our billing platforms. This is a complex multiyear project that we believe will simplify our systems and infrastructure, improve our customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies. We are energized with this focus we're driving into our business. Now we believe we have a clear strategic direction and by delivering on our key operational initiatives, we will successfully build on CenturyLink's history of delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Now moving to Slide 13. I'",979,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Now moving to Slide 13. I'll review a few highlights from our second quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid financial results for the second quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.5% decrease from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in higher cost support revenues due to CAF Phase II support, higher consumer strategic services and increased business high-bandwidth data services. I might point out here that as indicated in our release, this quarter, we moved private line from strategic to legacy revenue. Prior quarters have been restated to reflect this change. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.97 billion for the second quarter, a decrease of only 1.2% from the year-ago period. Our strategic revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year primarily driven by strength in high-bandwidth data services and higher consumers future growth in use. Operating income was $650 million, an increase of $101 million from second quarter of 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.65 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 37.5%. 
Cash expenses for the second quarter declined $48 million year-over-year primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB costs, stock-based compensation and other income was $617 million for the quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter, second quarter of 2016 was $0.36, an increase from $0.26 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.63, an increase from $0.55 in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to Slide 14 and our Business segment. In the second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion of operating revenues, which decreased $61 million or 2.3% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for this segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5% compared to second quarter 2015 and was driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, partially offset by the decline in hosting revenues. In addition, we had a onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 million. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.4% from second quarter 2015 due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services. Our data integration revenues declined $20 million from second quarter 2015 due primarily to lower CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses decreased $17 million or 1.1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee related and network expenses, partially offset by higher facilities cost. 
Now turning to Slide 15. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of $9 million or 6 tenths of a percent from second quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.5% year-over-year to $800 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 6.8% from second quarter a year ago as access line declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $18 [ph] million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs, commissions and marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in employee costs from lower headcount. 
Now turning to Slide 16. For the third quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.35 billion to $4.4 billion; core revenues of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion; and operating cash flow between $1.56 billion and $1.61 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be range from $0.52 to $0.57. Third quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be lower than second quarter 2016 operating revenues primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, broadband and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected decline in legacy revenues. Our anticipated sequential decrease in third quarter operating cash flow compared to second quarter is primarily due to the decline in revenues and expected higher normal seasonal cost. In addition, we expect to have higher than originally anticipated network sales and marketing cost related to our customer growth plans for the back half of the year. 
Although we did not provide free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, I want to point one additional item as you're thinking about first half versus second half trends. As you all are probably aware, but the news media earlier this year, we experienced record flooding in Louisiana, and as a result, many parishes in the state were declared as federal disaster areas and ineligible for Federal relief. As part of this relief, Federal and certain state cash taxes related to our first and second quarter tax estimates were delayed until the third quarter of 2016. 
For full year 2016, we slightly narrowed our cash taxes estimate to be $400 million to $500 million and, again, most of this will be paid in the last 6 months of the year. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although due to the higher expenses outlined earlier, operating cash flow will likely come in towards the lower portion of our range for the year. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio, however, to be in the low to mid-60% range for 2016. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

Basically, it's partially cash taxes in the last half of the year, but it's also CapEx because we'll spend more CapEx in the last half of the year than we did in the first half of this year as well as our operating income, our operating cash flow will be expected to decline somewhat in the second half of the year as well. With regard to the first question, you're correct that last year, as you point out, we cut expenses about $125 million between third and fourth quarter. We feel comfortable that with coming off seasonality from the third quarter, we'll have a normal reduction in expenses in the fourth quarter plus we will have programs in place to allow us to be able to cut operating expenses to come in within the guidance range that we're staying with."

The FCC order will likely address the definition of comparative and noncompetitive markets as well as perspective rates charged to carrier CLECs and wireless providers.

That's been a major position of ours, and we think we can have -- we can show that and we believe the commission is using data from cable TV companies that's 3 years old and kind of cable companies that share this data is not really correct. So we're encouraging the commission, really, to step back and use the most recent data that's available out there to make these decisions. Because we've made it past the special access really can take, we're not ready to provide a range of possible outcomes. It's too complex.

To the extent of high-speed Internet, that margin is better. So overall, the margin will continue to come down. So the important thing, I think, is that over time, we intend to be able to grow revenue and stabilize EBITDA and really start growing both revenue and EBITDA on a consolidated basis. And regarding the data center business [indiscernible], we expect to right now that there will be a. Sale, however, we're not limiting our sales to that. The colo business continue to be an important part of our future and we will be in the managed services businesses. We have big data capabilities.

We think by early second half of the year, we should be filter through those to a great degree and we'll see that churn rate come down. We'll see a more stabilization and accretion to ARPU at that point. So there's some still out there, but it's early second half of the year, we should see that subside quite a bit, the impact of that. As far as the speeds that we are projecting, certainly, in some markets, the cable companies have roll out higher speeds. However, we have more GPON assets than anyone has, any one of the cable competitors have. We have 40 megabits in over 30% of our markets today. That's going up significantly. We expect to have close to 4 million homes with access to 100 megabits or more by year-end on the businesses. So we believe we're to be very competitive, especially we don't feel we have to compete on the speed, but on service, on the services from our products that we're selling. And that's the chart I showed you, we showed earlier. If you can get the same service level with lower investment, lower speeds, then we think that's the right thing to do. We don't think we should go out and invest where it doesn't make sense in the low density markets. Again, as I said, maybe where we could take fiber are economically, we're going to do with.

As we begin on Slide 6, we had solid second quarter 2016 financial results. Our total revenue and core revenue were in line with our guidance. We also did a good job managing our expenses during the quarter, which resulted in an operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. 
We continue to see good demand for our high-bandwidth data services from our business customers as revenue grew more than 8% year-over-year, and we grew year-over-year consumer strategic service revenue approximately 5.5%. So overall, a very good quarter financially. On the other hand, our subscriber results were below our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail a little later in the call. 
One last point before we leave the overview, the strategic review process for our colocation business continues to move forward. And while we have work left to do, we remain optimistic about the level of interest and the prospects for a positive outcome. Now we expect to finalize this process in the late third quarter to early fourth quarter time frame. 
As we've said previously, our principal focus is on the sale of all our portion of the data centers, but we also have other alternatives should our process not result in a sale. We believe these are valuable assets, and we are committed to realizing that value for CenturyLink and our shareholders, while continuing to provide a strong colocation service offering for our customers. 
Now let's turn to a discussion of our operational focus and financial results. Continuing to Slide 7. As I shared with you last quarter, CenturyLink entered 2016 with a renewed focus on improving the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. This is an important reminder that our principal operational focus is providing our customers the network connections and related services they need to power their lives, their businesses and their communities. 
We will continue to provide a range of hosting, cloud, IT and managed services to our business customers and video and other services to our consumer customers. Our success in growing these services, though, is tied to our enabling and delivering excellent network connections. And we are focused on 4 key operational initiatives to drive achievement of that key objective. 
So as you move to Slide 8, first, we are focused on driving penetration in the existing network and adjacent capabilities. The network is the foundation of the value we deliver to our customers, and we believe maximizing penetration of enabled network capabilities is critical to our success. This initiative is really about execution. We have enabled a great deal of capability into [ph] our network and we have to drive higher sustained levels of market penetration to earn an attractive return on that investment. 
And we're seeing some positive results on this front as both business and consumer data revenues grew during the quarter, and we have achieved over 21% penetration of our year-end 2015 GPON-enabled addressable units. The 8% growth we saw in business high-bandwidth data services was a strong -- was a result of strong growth and Ethernet and MPLS services in the second quarter 2016. We believe these trends validate the value and relevance of our service offering and we are working hard to expand and improve them.
For example, in the Business segment, our new sales and marketing leadership team has refined our customer base into more tightly-targeted customer groups and key verticals and is tailoring the Street product and go-to-market strategies for each group and vertical. We believe this will improve our business customer engagement and drive greater sales execution. 
We're also expanding the scope of our partnership channels to drive more sales through partnerships and major software technology companies. On the consumer side, we're continuing to pivot towards the sale of higher speed, higher-value bundle offerings to better credit quality customers. These customers have a higher ARPU, lower churn and a much higher lifetime value than lower speeds, lower credit, standalone broadband customers. We believe this is the right approach for long-term health of our business, even though it does have an impact on broadband units, some of which we saw during the second quarter. 
As I referenced earlier during the second quarter, our high-speed data customers declined over 65,000. I'd like to make a couple of comments about those results. These broadband additions for the quarter were below our expectations driven, we believe in part, by our focus on acquiring higher-value bundled customers and less emphasis on standalone broadband customers. 
We did expect broadband additions to be affected by the pivot away from the standalone broadband customers, but the impact was greater than we anticipated. From an out [ph] standpoint, about 20% of the decline was driven by a higher-than-expected number of slow and non-paying customer churn. 
A significant percentage of the churn is related to standalone broadband customers who are less loyal than our traditional bundled customers. Also, there are underlying indicators of strength in the market as we have seen in the continued increase in the number of net adds with the 40 megabits and higher speeds, which we expect will deliver future benefits to the lower churn and higher ARPU. Now we expect unit trends to improve in the second half of the year as effects of the changes in our go-to-market and customer retention programs begin to take effect. 
Moving now to investing with discipline and a network-first focus. As I said earlier, we believe the best potential to grow our business is to focus on enabling and delivering fast, reliable technologically-advanced broadband access and related services. 
And during second quarter 2016, we continue to expand our capabilities. We believe we have enabled one of the largest deployments of software-defined networking, SDN, and network function virtualization, NFV, capabilities in the market. These technologies allow us to provide advanced network functionality and deliver much more efficiently than traditional deployments. 
Also, in late June, we announced the launch of our CenturyLink SD-WAN, software-defined wide area networking service. Today, we have dozens of customers and proof-of-concept trials and are working over 100 potential sales opportunities. And we will continue to invest to build this type of intelligence and efficiency into our broadband access network. 
From a broadband access standpoint, I want to take a few minutes to discuss our network evolution plan with you. What we think, it takes to be competitive where we are today and our plans to ensure we are keeping pace both with customer demand and competitive market. First, I wanted to make a point about speed enablement.
Our view is that we should always enable the highest speed that technology and market economics allow. We put fiber everywhere it makes sense to do so. But we also believe our access technologies such as vectoring, bonding and G.fast deliver market-competitive speeds when the cost of fiber deployment becomes prohibitive. 
Let me walk you through some of those numbers when we move to Slide 9. What you see here is an estimate of the bandwidth requirements of what we would describe as a heavy usage consumer customer: a household streaming 6 streams of HD video, including 2 streams of 4K video; a group HD call; a couple of HD gamers; multiple bit torrent downloads; and multiple music stream. 
As you can see, even in this relatively high usage case, which is well beyond the vast majority of user's activity, can be met with speeds of less than 100 megabits and that aligns with our own experience. We see speeds of 40 megabits to 100 megabits as competitive today in virtually all of our markets. 
We expect that usage curve to continue to increase over time, moving to the 100 megabits or 200 megabits range over the next several years. Certainly, there will be users who will seek the gigabit connection, but for the vast majority of consumers, we see 100 megabits to 200 megabits is being more than sufficient to meet market demand for a number of years. 
With that in mind, let's move to Slide 10 and take a look at where we are today with the broadband speed deployment, where our access enablement plan takes us over the next several years. We're confident we can accomplish these broadband speeds within the confines of our existing capital budget levels, and this is based on currently available compression and access technologies and average cost of deployment, which we hope will improve over time.
By year-end 2018, we expect to enable speeds of greater than 40 megabits to 85% of our top 25 markets, and to reach more than 55% of those markets with more than 100 megabits with a lot of that improvement coming over the next 12 to 18 months. And while not depicted on this chart, across all of our markets, this will represent about 50% of addressable units receiving 40 megabits and higher speeds and more than 30% of addressable units receiving 100 megabits and higher speeds by year-end 2018. 
By the time we get to year-end 2019, we'll have almost -- we expect to have almost 11 -- or about 11 million addressable units, representing 42% of total addressable units across all of our markets capable of receiving 100 megabits and higher. And in our top 25 markets, over 70% of addressable units expect to have 100 megabits and higher speeds. 
By this time, we also expect to have approximately 3 million addressable units enabled for 1 gigabit and higher speeds across all of our markets. Obviously, the changes in technology, cost of deployment and market factors could cause us to reassess our actual deployments either a little lower or a little higher. 
And while the details may vary, the point is we believe we can deploy very competitive speeds within our existing capital plans. And while our investment plans assume capital intensity at current levels, for the next several years, we do anticipate our capital intensity to return to historical averages over time. 
Let's move to Slide 11. Our next operational initiative is to exceptional customer experiences. As enabled speeds become more aligned among competitors and are more consistently in excess of the customers' needs, we believe customer experience becomes more relevant to the buying decision. 
Under our new sales and marketing leadership, we're intensifying our effort to go-to-market with a customer-focused approach. For example, we're in the process of reducing the many variations of one of our consumer products. This resulted in fewer easy-to-understand and easy-to-provision offerings. This will improve our customer experience and drive efficiencies into our operations. 
We've also continued an enhanced effort to accelerate provisioning of our business network services, and we've seen a 25% improvement in Ethernet service intervals since the first of this year and increased order velocity by approximately 60%. Again, this improvement drives a better customer experience, drives efficiencies in their operation and accelerates the order-to-cash cycle.  
Finally, we've increased the level of focus in our call centers in first call resolution for our customers. Now this focus on first call resolution is another change we believe may have affected our broadband additions for the quarter as we focus more on the customer issues rather than selling, but we believe the improved customer experience will improve customer retention and improve revenue over time. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating capital and capital efficiencies. We know we have to continue to realign our legacy cost structure. I think, our operating expenses for the second quarter show that we are focused on operating efficiencies. However, realizing the level of efficiencies we require will take more than just good cost management, we have several initiatives underway to drive even greater efficiencies. 
We simplified our product offerings. We are also in the process of simplifying our billing platforms. This is a complex multiyear project that we believe will simplify our systems and infrastructure, improve our customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies. We're energized with this focus we're driving into our business, and we believe we have a clear strategic direction. And by delivering on our key operational initiatives, we will successfully build on CenturyLink's history of delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Now moving to Slide 13. I'",973,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Now moving to Slide 13. I'll review the -- a few highlights from our second quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid financial results for the second quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.5% decrease from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in higher cost support revenues due to CAF Phase II support, higher consumer strategic services and increased business high-bandwidth data services. 
I might point out here that as indicated in our release, this quarter, we moved private line from strategic to legacy revenue. Prior quarters have been restated to reflect this change. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.97 billion for the second quarter, a decrease of only 1.2% from the year-ago period. Our strategic revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in high-bandwidth data services and higher consumers future growth in use. 
Operating income was $650 million, an increase of $101 million from second quarter of 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.65 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 37.5%. 
Cash expenses for the second quarter declined $48 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB costs, stock-based compensation and other income was $617 million for the quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter -- second quarter of 2016 was $0.36, an increase from $0.26 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.63, an increase from $0.55 in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to Slide 14 and our Business segment. In the second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion of operating revenues, which decreased $61 million or 2.3% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5% compared to second quarter 2015 and was driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, partially offset by the decline in hosting revenues. In addition, we had a onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 million. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.4% from second quarter 2015 due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services. Our data integration revenues declined $20 million from second quarter 2015 due primarily to lower CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses decreased $17 million or 1.1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related and network expenses, partially offset by higher facilities cost. 
Now turning to Slide 15. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of $9 million or 0.6% from second quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.5% year-over-year to $800 million, driven by year-over-year growth in, broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 6.8% from second quarter a year ago as access line declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $18 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs, commissions and marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in employee costs from lower headcount. 
Now turning to Slide 16. For the third quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.35 billion to $4.4 billion, core revenues of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion and operating cash flow between $1.56 billion and $1.61 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.52 to $0.57. Third quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be lower than second quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, broadband and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected decline in legacy revenues. 
Our anticipated sequential decrease in third quarter operating cash flow compared to second quarter is primarily due to the decline in revenues and expected higher normal seasonal cost. In addition, we expect to have higher than originally anticipated network sales and marketing cost related to our customer growth plans for the back half of the year. 
Although we do not provide free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, I want to point one additional item as you're thinking about first half versus second half trends. As you're all probably aware about the news media earlier this year, we experienced record flooding in Louisiana. And as a result, many parishes in the state were declared as federal disaster areas ineligible for federal relief. As part of this relief, federal and certain state cash taxes related to our first and second quarter tax estimates were delayed until the third quarter of 2016. 
For full year 2016, we slightly narrowed our cash taxes estimate to be $400 million to $500 million and, again, most of this will be paid in the last 6 months of the year. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although due to the higher expenses outlined earlier, operating cash flow will likely come in towards the lower portion of our range for the year. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio, however, to be in the low to mid-60% range for 2016. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

You did have about $178 million of sequential cost cuts last year in the fourth quarter, but you had a very specific program that you were implementing in the second half of the year. Could you kind of talk about why we can get comfortable with that mathematics? And then, again, just on the kind of -- I know you don't give the free cash flow guidance, Stewart, but you've generated about $1.4 billion to date. The midpoint of the guidance is $1.9 billion.

With regard to the first question, you're correct that last year, as you pointed out, we cut expenses about $125 million between the third and fourth quarter.

So that's an initiative we've started and continued to pivot our customers from a pure or single-focused high-speed Internet type of customer towards one, which is bundled. That is something that drives better ARPU as well as a longer lifetime revenue base for that customer. The second piece, though, is with regard to the price increases. Price increases, we saw some of the price increases take us back in the first half, and we're continuing to drive some of those price increases into the second half.

That's been a major position of ours, and we think we have -- we can show that. And we believe the commission is using data from cable TV companies that's 3 years old, and the cable companies have actually said this data is not really correct.

As we",2110,"Thank you, Tony, and thank you all for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter results and provide an update on our key operational initiatives, as well as provide guidance for next quarter and discuss our outlook in our business. 
As we begin on Slide 6, we had solid second quarter 2016 financial results. Our total revenue and core revenue were in line with our guidance. We also did a good job managing our expenses during the quarter, which resulted in operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. 
We continued to see good demand for our high-bandwidth data services from our business customers as revenue grew more than 8% year-over-year, and we grew year-over-year consumer strategic service revenue approximately 5.5%. So overall, a very good quarter financially. On the other hand, our subscriber results were below our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail a little later in the call. 
One last point before we leave the overview, the strategic review process for our colocation business continues to move forward. And while we have work left to do, we remain optimistic about the level of interest and the prospects for a positive outcome. Now we expect to finalize this process in the late third quarter to early fourth quarter time frame. 
As we've said previously, our principal focus is on the sale of all or a portion of the data centers, but we also have other alternatives should our process not result in a sale. We believe these are valuable assets, and we are committed to realizing that value for CenturyLink and our shareholders, while continuing to provide a strong colocation service offering for our customers. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of our operational focus and financial results. Continuing to Slide 7. As I shared with you last quarter, CenturyLink entered 2016 with a renewed focus on improving the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. This is an important reminder that our principal operational focus is providing our customers the network connections and related services they need to power their lives, their businesses and their communities. 
We will continue to provide a range of hosting, cloud, IT and managed services to our business customers and video and other services to our consumer customers. Our success in growing these services, though, is tied to our enabling and delivering excellent network connections. And we are focused on 4 key operational initiatives to drive achievement of that key objective. 
So as you move to Slide 8, first, we are focused on driving penetration of the existing network and adjacent capabilities. The network is the foundation of the value we deliver to our customers, and we believe maximizing penetration of enabled network capabilities is critical to our success. This initiative is really about execution. We have enabled a great deal of capability entered to [ph] our network, and we have to drive higher sustained levels of market penetration to earn an attractive return on that investment. 
And we're seeing some positive results on this front as both business and consumer data revenues grew during the quarter, and we have achieved over 21% penetration of our year-end 2015 GPON-enabled addressable units. The 8% growth we saw in business high-bandwidth data services was a strong -- was a result of strong growth in Ethernet and MPLS services in the second quarter 2016. We believe these trends validate the value and relevance of our service offering and we are working hard to expand and improve them.
For example, in the Business segment, our new sales and marketing leadership team has refined our customer base into more tightly-targeted customer groups and key verticals and is tailoring discrete product and go-to-market strategies for each group and vertical. We believe this will improve our business customer engagement and drive greater sales execution. 
We're also expanding the scope of our partnership channel to drive more sales through partnerships with major software and technology companies. On the consumer side, we're continuing to pivot towards the sale of higher speed, higher-value bundled offerings to better credit quality customers. These customers have a higher ARPU, lower churn and a much higher lifetime value than lower speed, lower credit, standalone broadband customers. We believe this is the right approach for the long-term health of our business, even though it does have an impact on broadband units, some of which we saw during the second quarter. 
As I referenced earlier during the second quarter, our high-speed data customers declined over 65,000. I'd like to make a couple of comments about those results. These broadband additions for the quarter were below our expectations, driven, we believe in part, by our focus on acquiring higher-value bundled customers and less emphasis on standalone broadband customers. 
We did expect broadband additions to be affected by the pivot away from the standalone broadband customers, but the impact was greater than we anticipated. From announced [ph] standpoint, about 20% of the decline was driven by a higher-than-expected number of slow and non-paying customer churn. 
A significant percentage of the churn is related to standalone broadband customers who are less loyal than our traditional bundled customers. Also, there are underlying indicators of strength in the market as we have seen a continued increase in the number of net adds at the 40 megabits and higher speeds, which we expect will deliver future benefits through lower churn and higher ARPU. Now we expect unit trends to improve in the second half of the year as the effects of the changes in our go-to-market and customer retention programs begin to take effect. 
Moving now to investing with discipline and a network-first focus. As I said earlier, we believe the best potential to grow our business is to focus on enabling and delivering fast, reliable technologically-advanced broadband access and related services. 
And during the second quarter 2016, we continued to expand our capabilities. We believe we have enabled one of the largest deployments of software-defined networking, SDN, and network function virtualization, NFV, capabilities in the market. These technologies allow us to provide advanced network functionality and deliver much more efficiently than traditional deployments. 
Also, in late June, we announced the launch of our CenturyLink SD-WAN, software-defined wide area networking service. Today, we have dozens of customers in proof-of-concept trials and are working over 100 potential sales opportunities. And we will continue to invest to build this type of intelligence and efficiency into our broadband access network. 
From a broadband access standpoint, I want to take a few minutes to discuss our network evolution plan with you: what we think it takes to be competitive where we are today, and our plans to ensure we are keeping pace both with customer demand and competitive market. First, I wanted to make a point about speed enablement.
Our view is that we should always enable the highest speed that technology and market economics allow. We put fiber everywhere it makes sense to do so. But we also believe our access technologies such as vectoring, bonding and G.fast can deliver market-competitive speeds when the cost of fiber deployment becomes prohibitive. 
Let me walk you through some of those numbers when we move to Slide 9. What you see here is an estimate of the bandwidth requirements of what we would describe as a heavy usage consumer customer: a household streaming 6 streams of HD video, including 2 streams of 4K video; a group HD call; a couple of HD gamers; multiple BitTorrent downloads; and multiple music streams. 
As you can see, even in this relatively high usage case, which is well beyond the vast majority of user's activity, can be met with speeds of less than 100 megabits and that aligns with our own experience. We see speeds of 40 megabits to 100 megabits as competitive today in virtually all of our markets. 
We expect that usage curve to continue to increase over time, moving to the 100 megabits or 200 megabits range over the next several years. Certainly, there will be users who will seek the gigabit connection, but for the vast majority of consumers, we see 100 megabits to 200 megabits as being more than sufficient to meet market demand for a number of years. 
With that in mind, let's move to Slide 10 and take a look at where we are today with the broadband speed deployment, where our access enablement plan takes us over the next several years. We're confident we can accomplish these broadband speeds within the confines of our existing capital budget levels, and this is based on currently available compression and access technologies and average cost of deployment, which we hope will improve over time.
By year-end 2018, we expect to enable speeds of greater than 40 megabits to 85% of our top 25 markets, and to reach more than 55% of those markets with more than 100 megabits with a lot of that improvement coming over the next 12 to 18 months. And while not depicted on this chart, across all of our markets, this will represent about 50% of addressable units receiving 40 megabits and higher speeds and more than 30% of addressable units receiving 100 megabits and higher speeds by year-end 2018. 
By the time we get to year-end 2019, we'll have almost -- we expect to have almost 11 -- or about 11 million addressable units, representing 42% of total addressable units across all of our markets capable of receiving 100 megabits and higher. And in our top 25 markets, over 70% of addressable units are expected to have 100 megabits and higher speeds. 
By this time, we also expect to have approximately 3 million addressable units enabled for 1 gigabit and higher speeds across all of our markets. Obviously, the changes in technology, cost of deployment and market factors could cause us to reassess our actual deployments either a little lower or a little higher. 
And while the details may vary, the point is we believe we can deploy very competitive speeds within our existing capital plans. And while our investment plans assume capital intensity at current levels, for the next several years, we do anticipate our capital intensity to return to historical averages over time. 
Let's move to Slide 11. Our next operational initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As enabled speeds become more aligned among competitors and are more consistently in excess of the customers' needs, we believe customer experience becomes more relevant to the buying decision. 
Under our new sales and marketing leadership, we're intensifying our effort to go-to-market with a customer-focused approach. For example, we're in the process of reducing the many variations of one of our consumer products. This resulted in fewer easy-to-understand and easy-to-provision offerings. This will improve our customer experience and drive efficiencies into our operations. 
We've also continued an intense effort to accelerate provisioning of our business network services, and we've seen a 25% improvement in Ethernet service intervals since the first of this year and increased order velocity by approximately 60%. Again, this improvement drives a better customer experience, drives efficiencies in their operation and accelerates the order-to-cash cycle.  
Finally, we've increased the level of focus in our call centers in first call resolution for our customers. Now this focus on first call resolution is another change we believe may have affected our broadband additions for the quarter as we focused more on the customer's issues rather than selling. But we believe the improved customer experience will improve customer retention and improve revenue over time. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating capital and capital efficiencies. We know we have to continue to realign our legacy cost structure. I think our operating expenses for the second quarter show that we are focused on operating efficiencies. However, realizing the level of efficiencies we require will take more than just good cost management, we have several initiatives underway to drive even greater efficiencies. 
We simplified our product offerings. We are also in the process of simplifying our billing platforms. This is a complex multiyear project that we believe will simplify our systems infrastructure, improve our customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies. We're energized with this focus we're driving into our business, and we believe we have a clear strategic direction. And by delivering on our key operational initiatives, we will successfully build on CenturyLink's history of delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Now moving to Slide 13. I'",973,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Now moving to Slide 13. I'll review the -- a few highlights from our second quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid financial results for the second quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.5% decrease from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in high cost support revenues due to CAF Phase II support, higher consumer strategic services and increased business high-bandwidth data services. 
I might point out here that as indicated in our release, this quarter, we moved private line from strategic to legacy revenue. Prior quarters have been restated to reflect this change. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.97 billion for the second quarter, a decrease of only 1.2% from the year-ago period. Our strategic revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in high-bandwidth data services and higher consumer strategic revenues. 
Operating income was $650 million, an increase of $101 million from second quarter of 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.65 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 37.5%. 
Cash expenses for the second quarter declined $48 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income was $617 million for the quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter -- second quarter of 2016 was $0.36, an increase from $0.26 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.63, an increase from $0.55 in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to Slide 14 and our Business segment. In the second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion of operating revenues, which decreased $61 million or 2.3% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5% compared to second quarter 2015 and was driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, partially offset by the decline in hosting revenues. In addition, we had a onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 million. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.4% from second quarter 2015 due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services. Our data integration revenues declined $20 million from second quarter 2015 due primarily to lower CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses decreased $17 million or 1.1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related and network expenses, partially offset by higher facilities cost. 
Now turning to Slide 15. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of $9 million or 0.6% from second quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.5% year-over-year to $800 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 6.8% from second quarter a year ago as access line declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $18 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs, commissions and marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in employee costs from lower headcount. 
Now turning to Slide 16. For the third quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.35 billion to $4.4 billion, core revenues of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion and operating cash flow between $1.56 billion and $1.61 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.52 to $0.57. Third quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be lower than second quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, broadband and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected decline in legacy revenues. 
Our anticipated sequential decrease in third quarter operating cash flow compared to second quarter is primarily due to the decline in revenues and expected higher normal seasonal cost. In addition, we expect to have higher than originally anticipated network sales and marketing cost related to our customer growth plans for the back half of the year. 
Although we do not provide free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, I want to point one additional item as you're thinking about first half versus second half trends. As you all are probably aware by the news media earlier this year, we experienced record flooding in Louisiana. And as a result, many parishes in the state were declared as federal disaster areas and eligible for federal relief. As part of this relief, federal and certain state cash taxes related to our first and second quarter tax estimates were delayed until the third quarter of 2016. 
For full year 2016, we slightly narrowed our cash taxes estimate to be $400 million to $500 million and, again, most of this will be paid in the last 6 months of the year. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although due to the higher expenses outlined earlier, operating cash flow will likely come in towards the lower portion of our range for the year. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio, however, to be in the low to mid-60% range for 2016. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

You did have about $178 million of sequential cost cuts last year in the fourth quarter, but you had a very specific program that you were implementing in the second half of the year. Could you kind of talk about why we can get comfortable with that mathematics? And then, again, just on the kind of -- I know you don't give the free cash flow guidance, Stewart, but you've generated about $1.4 billion to date. The midpoint of the guidance is $1.9 billion.

With regard to the first question, you're correct that last year, as you pointed out, we cut expenses about $125 million between the third and fourth quarter. We feel comfortable that with coming off seasonality from the third quarter, we'll have a normal reduction in expenses in the fourth quarter, plus we will have programs in place to allow us to be able to cut operating expenses to come in within the guidance range that we're staying with."

We're in conversation with almost all of the industry stakeholders, including the cable companies, CLECs, other industry players in hopes that we're our negotiating a workable solution that we can bring to the FCC, to the Chief, a balanced reform. The FCC order will likely address the definition of competitive and noncompetitive markets as well as prospective rates charged to carriers and CLECs and wireless providers. We are on record and in direct conversations with Chairman Wheeler and other commissioners that the vast majority of our markets are fully competitive and that those rates should not be regulated. That's been a major position of ours, and we think we have -- we can show that. And we believe the commission is using data from cable TV companies that's 3 years old, and the cable companies have actually said this data is not really correct. So we're encouraging the commission, really, to step back and use the most recent data that's available out there to make these decisions.

It allows us to differentiate not only the product offerings we take to those market segments but also how we bundle or create product groupings solutions that we're going to take to the marketplace as well. And so when we think about the markets in the large account space, what we call global markets, it's one that really is driven by vertical market penetration. So we've got a couple of vertical markets that we're going forward with today. We'll be adding more as we go forward. Those vertical markets, especially for large accounts, are absolutely essential in order to create credibility and relationships, strong relationships with the customer base. So that's where we are with regard to the go-to-market in the business space and how we're going to address those market opportunities. We are starting to see some traction in the marketplace, and I believe that the market structure that we've implemented today is something that our customers have looked for in -- not only in our business but in our competitors.

As far as the speeds that we are projecting, certainly, in some markets, the cable companies roll out higher speeds. However, we have a lot of -- more GPON out there than anyone has, any one of the cable competitors have. We have 40 megabits in over 30% of our markets today. That's going up significantly.

As we begin on Slide 6, we had solid second quarter 2016 financial results. Our total revenue and core revenue were in line with our guidance. We also did a good job managing our expenses during the quarter, which resulted in operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. 
We continued to see good demand for our high-bandwidth data services from our business customers as revenue grew more than 8% year-over-year, and we grew year-over-year consumer strategic service revenue approximately 5.5%. So overall, a very good quarter financially. On the other hand, our subscriber results were below our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail a little later in the call. 
One last point before we leave the overview, the strategic review process for our colocation business continues to move forward. And while we have work left to do, we remain optimistic about the level of interest and the prospects for a positive outcome. Now we expect to finalize this process in the late third quarter to early fourth quarter time frame. 
As we've said previously, our principal focus is on the sale of all or a portion of the data centers, but we also have other alternatives should our process not result in a sale. We believe these are valuable assets, and we are committed to realizing that value for CenturyLink and our shareholders, while continuing to provide a strong colocation service offering for our customers. 
Now let's turn to the discussion of our operational focus and financial results. Continuing to Slide 7. As I shared with you last quarter, CenturyLink entered 2016 with a renewed focus on improving the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. This is an important reminder that our principal operational focus is providing our customers the network connections and related services they need to power their lives, their businesses and their communities. 
We will continue to provide a range of hosting, cloud, IT and managed services to our business customers and video and other services to our consumer customers. Our success in growing these services, though, is tied to our enabling and delivering excellent network connections. And we are focused on 4 key operational initiatives to drive achievement of that key objective. 
So as you move to Slide 8, first, we are focused on driving penetration of the existing network and adjacent capabilities. The network is the foundation of the value we deliver to our customers, and we believe maximizing penetration of enabled network capabilities is critical to our success. This initiative is really about execution. We have enabled a great deal of capability entered to [ph] our network, and we have to drive higher sustained levels of market penetration to earn an attractive return on that investment. 
And we're seeing some positive results on this front as both business and consumer data revenues grew during the quarter, and we have achieved over 21% penetration of our year-end 2015 GPON-enabled addressable units. The 8% growth we saw in business high-bandwidth data services was a strong -- was a result of strong growth in Ethernet and MPLS services in the second quarter 2016. We believe these trends validate the value and relevance of our service offering and we are working hard to expand and improve them.
For example, in the Business segment, our new sales and marketing leadership team has refined our customer base into more tightly-targeted customer groups and key verticals and is tailoring discrete product and go-to-market strategies for each group and vertical. We believe this will improve our business customer engagement and drive greater sales execution. 
We're also expanding the scope of our partnership channel to drive more sales through partnerships with major software and technology companies. On the consumer side, we're continuing to pivot towards the sale of higher speed, higher-value bundled offerings to better credit quality customers. These customers have a higher ARPU, lower churn and a much higher lifetime value than lower speed, lower credit, standalone broadband customers. We believe this is the right approach for the long-term health of our business, even though it does have an impact on broadband units, some of which we saw during the second quarter. 
As I referenced earlier during the second quarter, our high-speed data customers declined over 65,000. I'd like to make a couple of comments about those results. These broadband additions for the quarter were below our expectations, driven, we believe in part, by our focus on acquiring higher-value bundled customers and less emphasis on standalone broadband customers. 
We did expect broadband additions to be affected by the pivot away from the standalone broadband customers, but the impact was greater than we anticipated. From announced [ph] standpoint, about 20% of the decline was driven by a higher-than-expected number of slow and non-paying customer churn. 
A significant percentage of the churn is related to standalone broadband customers who are less loyal than our traditional bundled customers. Also, there are underlying indicators of strength in the market as we have seen a continued increase in the number of net adds at the 40 megabits and higher speeds, which we expect will deliver future benefits through lower churn and higher ARPU. Now we expect unit trends to improve in the second half of the year as the effects of the changes in our go-to-market and customer retention programs begin to take effect. 
Moving now to investing with discipline and a network-first focus. As I said earlier, we believe the best potential to grow our business is to focus on enabling and delivering fast, reliable technologically-advanced broadband access and related services. 
And during the second quarter 2016, we continued to expand our capabilities. We believe we have enabled one of the largest deployments of software-defined networking, SDN, and network function virtualization, NFV, capabilities in the market. These technologies allow us to provide advanced network functionality and deliver much more efficiently than traditional deployments. 
Also, in late June, we announced the launch of our CenturyLink SD-WAN, software-defined wide area networking service. Today, we have dozens of customers in proof-of-concept trials and are working over 100 potential sales opportunities. And we will continue to invest to build this type of intelligence and efficiency into our broadband access network. 
From a broadband access standpoint, I want to take a few minutes to discuss our network evolution plan with you: what we think it takes to be competitive where we are today, and our plans to ensure we are keeping pace both with customer demand and competitive market. First, I wanted to make a point about speed enablement.
Our view is that we should always enable the highest speed that technology and market economics allow. We put fiber everywhere it makes sense to do so. But we also believe our access technologies such as vectoring, bonding and G.fast can deliver market-competitive speeds when the cost of fiber deployment becomes prohibitive. 
Let me walk you through some of those numbers when we move to Slide 9. What you see here is an estimate of the bandwidth requirements of what we would describe as a heavy usage consumer customer: a household streaming 6 streams of HD video, including 2 streams of 4K video; a group HD call; a couple of HD gamers; multiple BitTorrent downloads; and multiple music streams. 
As you can see, even in this relatively high usage case, which is well beyond the vast majority of user's activity, can be met with speeds of less than 100 megabits and that aligns with our own experience. We see speeds of 40 megabits to 100 megabits as competitive today in virtually all of our markets. 
We expect that usage curve to continue to increase over time, moving to the 100 megabits or 200 megabits range over the next several years. Certainly, there will be users who will seek the gigabit connection, but for the vast majority of consumers, we see 100 megabits to 200 megabits as being more than sufficient to meet market demand for a number of years. 
With that in mind, let's move to Slide 10 and take a look at where we are today with the broadband speed deployment, where our access enablement plan takes us over the next several years. We're confident we can accomplish these broadband speeds within the confines of our existing capital budget levels, and this is based on currently available compression and access technologies and average cost of deployment, which we hope will improve over time.
By year-end 2018, we expect to enable speeds of greater than 40 megabits to 85% of our top 25 markets, and to reach more than 55% of those markets with more than 100 megabits with a lot of that improvement coming over the next 12 to 18 months. And while not depicted on this chart, across all of our markets, this will represent about 50% of addressable units receiving 40 megabits and higher speeds and more than 30% of addressable units receiving 100 megabits and higher speeds by year-end 2018. 
By the time we get to year-end 2019, we'll have almost -- we expect to have almost 11 -- or about 11 million addressable units, representing 42% of total addressable units across all of our markets capable of receiving 100 megabits and higher. And in our top 25 markets, over 70% of addressable units are expected to have 100 megabits and higher speeds. 
By this time, we also expect to have approximately 3 million addressable units enabled for 1 gigabit and higher speeds across all of our markets. Obviously, the changes in technology, cost of deployment and market factors could cause us to reassess our actual deployments either a little lower or a little higher. 
And while the details may vary, the point is we believe we can deploy very competitive speeds within our existing capital plans. And while our investment plans assume capital intensity at current levels, for the next several years, we do anticipate our capital intensity to return to historical averages over time. 
Let's move to Slide 11. Our next operational initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As enabled speeds become more aligned among competitors and are more consistently in excess of the customers' needs, we believe customer experience becomes more relevant to the buying decision. 
Under our new sales and marketing leadership, we're intensifying our effort to go-to-market with a customer-focused approach. For example, we're in the process of reducing the many variations of one of our consumer products. This resulted in fewer easy-to-understand and easy-to-provision offerings. This will improve our customer experience and drive efficiencies into our operations. 
We've also continued an intense effort to accelerate provisioning of our business network services, and we've seen a 25% improvement in Ethernet service intervals since the first of this year and increased order velocity by approximately 60%. Again, this improvement drives a better customer experience, drives efficiencies in their operation and accelerates the order-to-cash cycle.  
Finally, we've increased the level of focus in our call centers in first call resolution for our customers. Now this focus on first call resolution is another change we believe may have affected our broadband additions for the quarter as we focused more on the customer's issues rather than selling. But we believe the improved customer experience will improve customer retention and improve revenue over time. 
Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating capital and capital efficiencies. We know we have to continue to realign our legacy cost structure. I think our operating expenses for the second quarter show that we are focused on operating efficiencies. However, realizing the level of efficiencies we require will take more than just good cost management, we have several initiatives underway to drive even greater efficiencies. 
We simplified our product offerings. We are also in the process of simplifying our billing platforms. This is a complex multiyear project that we believe will simplify our systems infrastructure, improve our customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies. We're energized with this focus we're driving into our business, and we believe we have a clear strategic direction. And by delivering on our key operational initiatives, we will successfully build on CenturyLink's history of delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?"

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. 
Now moving to Slide 13. I'll review the -- a few highlights from our second quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid financial results for the second quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.5% decrease from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in high cost support revenues due to CAF Phase II support, higher consumer strategic services and increased business high-bandwidth data services. 
I might point out here that as indicated in our release, this quarter, we moved private line from strategic to legacy revenue. Prior quarters have been restated to reflect this change. 
Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.97 billion for the second quarter, a decrease of only 1.2% from the year-ago period. Our strategic revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in high-bandwidth data services and higher consumer strategic revenues. 
Operating income was $650 million, an increase of $101 million from second quarter of 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.65 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 37.5%. 
Cash expenses for the second quarter declined $48 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income was $617 million for the quarter. 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter -- second quarter of 2016 was $0.36, an increase from $0.26 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.63, an increase from $0.55 in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving to Slide 14 and our Business segment. In the second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.6 billion of operating revenues, which decreased $61 million or 2.3% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5% compared to second quarter 2015 and was driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, partially offset by the decline in hosting revenues. In addition, we had a onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 million. 
Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.4% from second quarter 2015 due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services. Our data integration revenues declined $20 million from second quarter 2015 due primarily to lower CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses decreased $17 million or 1.1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related and network expenses, partially offset by higher facilities cost. 
Now turning to Slide 15. The Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of $9 million or 0.6% from second quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.5% year-over-year to $800 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 6.8% from second quarter a year ago as access line declines were partially offset by select price increases. 
Operating expenses increased $18 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV costs, commissions and marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in employee costs from lower headcount. 
Now turning to Slide 16. For the third quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.35 billion to $4.4 billion, core revenues of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion and operating cash flow between $1.56 billion and $1.61 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.52 to $0.57. Third quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be lower than second quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, broadband and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected decline in legacy revenues. 
Our anticipated sequential decrease in third quarter operating cash flow compared to second quarter is primarily due to the decline in revenues and expected higher normal seasonal cost. In addition, we expect to have higher than originally anticipated network sales and marketing cost related to our customer growth plans for the back half of the year. 
Although we do not provide free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, I want to point one additional item as you're thinking about first half versus second half trends. As you all are probably aware by the news media earlier this year, we experienced record flooding in Louisiana. And as a result, many parishes in the state were declared as federal disaster areas and eligible for federal relief. As part of this relief, federal and certain state cash taxes related to our first and second quarter tax estimates were delayed until the third quarter of 2016. 
For full year 2016, we slightly narrowed our cash taxes estimate to be $400 million to $500 million and, again, most of this will be paid in the last 6 months of the year. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although due to the higher expenses outlined earlier, operating cash flow will likely come in towards the lower portion of our range for the year. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio, however, to be in the low to mid-60% range for 2016. 
This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call."

You did have about $178 million of sequential cost cuts last year in the fourth quarter, but you had a very specific program that you were implementing in the second half of the year. Could you kind of talk about why we can get comfortable with that mathematics? And then, again, just on the kind of -- I know you don't give the free cash flow guidance, Stewart, but you've generated about $1.4 billion to date. The midpoint of the guidance is $1.9 billion.

With regard to the first question, you're correct that last year, as you pointed out, we cut expenses about $125 million between the third and fourth quarter. We feel comfortable that with coming off seasonality from the third quarter, we'll have a normal reduction in expenses in the fourth quarter, plus we will have programs in place to allow us to be able to cut operating expenses to come in within the guidance range that we're staying with."

We're in conversation with almost all of the industry stakeholders, including the cable companies, CLECs, other industry players in hopes that we're our negotiating a workable solution that we can bring to the FCC, to the Chief, a balanced reform. The FCC order will likely address the definition of competitive and noncompetitive markets as well as prospective rates charged to carriers and CLECs and wireless providers. We are on record and in direct conversations with Chairman Wheeler and other commissioners that the vast majority of our markets are fully competitive and that those rates should not be regulated. That's been a major position of ours, and we think we have -- we can show that. And we believe the commission is using data from cable TV companies that's 3 years old, and the cable companies have actually said this data is not really correct. So we're encouraging the commission, really, to step back and use the most recent data that's available out there to make these decisions.

So with regard to refining the go-to-market, what we've done is we've transitioned from a go-to-market that is really driven by product to a go-to-market that's more market sensitive and market focused. So customer groups much more than product groups. And so for example, we've got 7 routes to market in our new go-to-market construction. And so they've got large accounts, SMB and so on. It allows us to differentiate not only the product offerings we take to those market segments but also how we bundle or create product groupings solutions that we're going to take to the marketplace as well. And so when we think about the markets in the large account space, what we call global markets, it's one that really is driven by vertical market penetration. So we've got a couple of vertical markets that we're going forward with today. We'll be adding more as we go forward. Those vertical markets, especially for large accounts, are absolutely essential in order to create credibility and relationships, strong relationships with the customer base. So that's where we are with regard to the go-to-market in the business space and how we're going to address those market opportunities. We are starting to see some traction in the marketplace, and I believe that the market structure that we've implemented today is something that our customers have looked for in -- not only in our business but in our competitors. And I think that we're seeing that benefit in the way in which we're interacting with our customers and the opportunities that we're seeing in the marketplace with those solutions."

As far as the speeds that we are projecting, certainly, in some markets, the cable companies roll out higher speeds. However, we have a lot of -- more GPON out there than anyone has, any one of the cable competitors have. We have 40 megabits in over 30% of our markets today. That's going up significantly. We expect to have close to 4 million homes with access to 100 megabits or more by year end on the businesses. So we believe we can be very competitive.

And then, of course, the other piece of the whole speed equation that we try and educate our customers about is the symmetry of speed.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together, we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll [ph] turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile, and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth, trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year of post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again, including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
on [ph] to Slide 8, the transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination, as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important, really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've longed admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders, and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second to none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen, I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees, and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue; and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11, as you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that of the top service providers in the country, we have about far [ph] the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12, we highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million, we believe, are very achievable annual operating and [ph] capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate that our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver; free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth; and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in a complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14, this is an overview of the pro forma arch [ph] structure depicting the combination and the associated new debt raise. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or noteholders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent, and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.

Now turning to Slide 16, and to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our [ph] operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and recontract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 78 -- 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart."

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of the fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results, with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS, all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19 and our Business segment, in the third quarter, the Business segment generated $2.61 billion  in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low bandwidth data services revenues.  Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services. On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year.  Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21, for fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to raise from $0.53 to $0.59. In fourth quarter, we expected continued growth and strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.  Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of [indiscernible] plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million related to planned headcount reductions. These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided.  As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third, second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid grow",950,"Thank you, Steward. I'll just dive right into into our third quarter results. During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let them go to the numbers but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers. Cloud connect solutions, IT services, IT VPNs and hybrid LAN continue to address the key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to ramp security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator, and is also well-received within the market.  I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers. As further evidence, in general, sales are good. However, our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have, and created a communication void [ph] at the lower end of our customer base. With slightly larger customers, they're still at the small end. We let those customers in the field sales organization and really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket, again, creating a communication void with these customers.  Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and are excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. But we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating our own customer's transitions faster than their natural rate, resulting more work through our operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue.  We saw this dynamic effect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'll make some of these decisions differently. To become an aggressive company we move fast and lean into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales, inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos. We've lost a little bit of attention to these. We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers rather than in sending sales of our customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not at an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions.  In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation more heavily weighted revenue than sales. We made process in organizational restructure on changes designed to enhance the customer experience and service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is a lagging indicator, and will take time to deliver results. 
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that is within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."
260149,402278150,1067117,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation,",666,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation, offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our recent results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance is the high end of our customer bases performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially.  Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $220,000 [ph] per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services will longer installation [indiscernible]. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improved churn. For the past couple of quarters, we experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower speed services. Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter driven by some large IP customer rebates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.  Overall, in EMEA, we are encouraged as Enterprises CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16% or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%. Transport and fiber declined 1%. Voice services grew 0.4%, and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26, adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and [indiscernible] sales.
The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator so we could get your questions."

Next year, because of the cash taxes that we anticipated increasing, our payout ratio is going to bump up to the low to mid-80s. When you get about 4 years out, the dividend payout ratio moves down to about 60%. So it helps our dividend payout ratio about 10 percentage points each year until you get in the first year really.

But we're working with the wireless providers. We are a great distribution for those companies, and we're talking to them as we speak about further partnerships, ability to work together because we have the primary access, capability with our fiber, and we want to bring, resell their wireless. We don't see a need at this point to go out and buy a wireless carrier. We think that these companies are working well with us and we're actually making a little money with their reseller ranges we have in place today. So we will continue to work with them, but it's not a major factor for us and ability to compete in our view. Jeff, you want to add to that?"

And so we will continue to focus on providing those high-end solutions for our enterprise customers, and we haven't seen that impact our ability to grow over the past years.

And so I look at when I talk about our revenue, I'm not going to give quantitative numbers. When we talk about our revenue growth, we have very clear expectations for what's acceptable, where we think we can be, and we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we are just some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller end customers. That's been a problem. If you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, is not a problem with our products and services. Our hiring customers where we are focused have been growing and growing nicely. The lower end customers where we took our eye out then, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions and we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to do of sales. We always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out that it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue not only over the course of the next year and until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

The network rationalization is more about converting off net to On-Net. And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert Off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end, we provide a better customer experience. We save money, we're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service.

260149,402278150,1067315,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together, we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile, and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth, trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year of post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again, including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
Going to Slide 8, the transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination, as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important, really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've longed admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders, and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second to none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen, I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees, and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Glen."

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue; and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11, as you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that of the top service providers in the country, we have, by far, the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12, we highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million, we believe, are very achievable annual operating and capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate that our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to discuss the financial profile of the new company. Stewart?"

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver; free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth; and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in a complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14, this is an overview of the pro forma arch structure depicting the combination and the associated new debt raise. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or noteholders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent, and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Glen."

As previously mentioned, the transaction is also subject to approval by CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders, and we're pleased to have secured a voting agreement in favor of the transaction with STT Crossing Ltd. 
Now turning to Slide 16, and to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and recontract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 78 -- 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart."

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of the fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results, with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS, all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19 in our Business segment. In the third quarter, the Business segment generated $2.61 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services.
On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year. Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the Consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21. For fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.59. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million related to planned headcount reductions.
These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided. As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third -- second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we've spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let Sunit go into the numbers, but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers.
Cloud Connect Solutions, IT services, IP VPNs and hybrid LANs continue to address the key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to ramp security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator, and is also well-received within the market.
I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher-end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers.
As further evidence, in general, sales are good. However, our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have had the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have and created a communication void at the lower end of our customer base.
With slightly larger customers, but still at the small end, we left those customers in the field sales organization and really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket. Again, creating a communication void with these customers. Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and we're excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. While we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating our own customers' transitions faster than their natural rate, results in more work for the operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue. We saw this dynamic effect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'd make some of these decisions differently. By being an aggressive company, we moved fast and leaned into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales -- inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos, we've lost a little bit of attention to these.
We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers, rather than intending sales or the customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not at an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions. In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation more heavily weighting revenue than sales. We made process and organizational and structural changes designed to enhance the customer experience and service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is the lagging indicator and they'll take time to deliver results.
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that it's within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted, on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation, offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our regional results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance at the high end of our customer base is performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers, who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue, grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially. Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $20,000 per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services with longer installation in tools [ph]. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improved churn. For the past couple of quarters, we've experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower-speed services.
Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter driven by some large IP customer rerates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. Overall, in EMEA, we are encouraged as enterprise CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16%, or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%, transport and fiber declined 1%, voice services grew 0.4% and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26, adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  
Year-to-date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and wavelength sales. The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator so we can get to your questions."

And we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we addressed some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller-end customers. That's been our problem. And if you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, is not a problem with our products and services. Our hiring customers where we are focused have been growing and growing nicely. Now the lower-end customers, where we took our eye off then, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions. And we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to drive sales and we always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that, that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out that it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink, looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue not only over the course of the next year until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

The good thing about this is that because we delever so quickly, it'll give us the luxury of investing where we need to invest to be able to grow our business together faster than we can grow our business separately. From the dividend standpoint, we haven't really discussed increasing the dividend. But again, the dividend payout ratio will decline pretty significantly from 2018, which would be the first full year that we expect to be together after 2021."

I'll also add that with the Level 3 network, they have a lot of conduit available, which reduces the cost of build in these areas significantly down to like $0.50 a foot now, when you're -- just pulling fiber to conduit. So tremendous potential there, value creation over time with that asset. But right now, we feel like we've gone through the synergies pretty aggressively. And if there aren't more network synergies there, but we've -- the ones we've identified, we're very confident we'll achieve. Stewart, do you want to add anything or two?"

We've acquired a bunch of companies. We've looked at shutting down networks. Sometimes that makes sense. But we're very good at capturing synergies. Both companies have demonstrated the capability over time to do this. And so we're very confident about those. But network rationalization is more about converting off-net to on-net. And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end, we provide a better customer experience. We save money. We're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors, because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service. And so we focus very aggressively, and I think both companies have this history, focused very aggressively on network rationalization. But it's is usually moving from other competitors on to our backbone to provide a better customer experience."

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
Going to Slide 8.  The transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important -- really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've long admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company, able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing, but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second-to-none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue, and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11.  As you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that, of the top service providers in the country, we have by far the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12.  We highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million of what we believe are very achievable annual operating and capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a combined company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver, free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in the complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14.  This is an overview of the pro forma arch structure, depicting the combination and the associated new debt raised. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink, post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or note-holders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from the expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Glen."

As previously mentioned, the transaction is also subject to approval by CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders, and we're pleased to have secured a voting agreement in favor of the transaction with STT Crossing Ltd. 
Now turning to Slide 16.  And to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction, before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high-risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and re-contract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that I'll turn it over to Stewart."

Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding s",877,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter, as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19, in our Business segment. In the third quarter the Business segment generated $2.61 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services.
On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year. Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the Consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21. For fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.59. In fourth quarter we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million, related to planned headcount reductions.
These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided. As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full-year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third -- second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in",951,"Thank you, Stewart. I'll just dive right into our third quarter results. During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we've spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let Sunit go into the numbers, but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers.
Cloud Connect Solutions, IT services, IP VPNs and hybrid LANs continue to address a key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to wrap security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator and is also well-received within the market.
I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher-end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers.
As further evidence, in general sales are good. However our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we've made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have had the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have and created a communication void at the low end of our customer base.
With slightly larger customers, but still at the small end, we left those customers in the field sales organization but really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket. Again creating a communication void with these customers. Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and are excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. While we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating your own customers' transitions faster than their natural rate results in more work for your operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue. We saw this dynamic affect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'd make some of these decisions differently. But being an aggressive company, we move fast and lean into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales -- inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos.  We've lost a little bit of attention to this.
We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers rather than in sending sales or the customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not in an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions. In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation, more heavily weighting revenue than sales. We've made process and organizational and structural changes designed to enhance the customer experience in service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is a lagging indicator and they will take time to deliver results.
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that it's within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that I'll turn the call over to Sunit."
260149,402278150,1067405,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation",664,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our regional results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance at the high end of our customer base is performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers, who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue, grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially. Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $20,000 per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services with longer installation intervals. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improve churn. For the past couple of quarters, we've experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower-speed services.
Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher-bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter, driven by some large IP customer re-rates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. Overall in EMEA, we are encouraged as enterprise CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16%, or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%; transport and fiber declined 1%; voice services grew 0.4%; and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26.  Adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network-access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  
Year to date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and wavelength sales. The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.

Next year, because of the cash taxes that we anticipated increasing, our payout ratio is going to bump up to the low to mid-80s. When you get about 4 years out, the dividend payout ratio moves down to about 60%. So it helps our dividend payout ratio about 10 percentage points each year until you get in the first year, really.

One of the things that sort of stands out is that the current top 2 in that sector, AT&T and Verizon, also sell mobility into enterprises. And in the case of AT&T, it's actually a fairly meaningful part of how they think about the revenue opportunity in that addressable market. And so as you think about how this deal is going to really elevate the combined business into the league that these guys are playing in, how do you think about the role of mobility being a part of the solution set that you offer? And if it is something you think that's going to be increasingly important, what are some of your options for incorporating that?"

But we're working with the wireless providers. We are a great distribution arm for those companies. And we're talking to them, as we speak, about further partnerships, ability to work together, because we have -- we'll have the primary access capability with our fiber, and we'll want to bring -- resell their wireless. We don't see any need at this point to go out and buy a wireless carrier. We think that these companies are working well with us, and we're actually making a little money with the resell arrangements we have in place today. So we'll continue to work with them.

And so I look at -- when we talk about our revenue -- I'm not going to give quantitative numbers. But when we talk about our revenue growth, we have very clear expectations for what's acceptable and where we think we can be. And we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned in the -- earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we addressed some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller-end customers. That's been our problem. And if you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, it's not a problem with our products and services. Our higher-end customers, where we are focused, have been growing and growing nicely. Now the lower-end customers, where we took our eye off them, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions. And we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to drive sales and we always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that, that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink, looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue, not only over the course of the next year until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

Both companies have demonstrated a capability over time to do this. And so we're very confident about those. But network rationalization is more about converting off-net to on-net. And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end.  We provide a better customer experience. We save money. We're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors, because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. This is an exciting today for CenturyLink and Level 3. Together, we will be the second-largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers. We believe we will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
We'll turn to Slide 5. Today marks an important day in advancing our shared visions and strategies. Together we are creating a customer-centric focus and providing customers leading products and services. We are building scalable and agile network-based services to deliver industry-leading value, and both companies strive to adhere to our core values. Today, we really are announcing a new chapter for both companies.
We'll turn to Slide 7 to provide some key highlights of the transaction. First of all, the combined -- combined, we will create a leading facilities-based enterprise communications provider. We will have a strong financial profile, with pro forma total business revenue of approximately $19 billion and business strategic revenue of $13 billion. Total revenue, including our consumer business, will be approximately $26 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $11 billion, including synergies. We believe the transaction -- or the strategic combination, rather, will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile and better position the combined company to improve its revenue growth trend and drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year post-closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs.
Additionally, we believe the combined company will be able to achieve more than 10% growth and free cash flow per share in the full year post-closing, including synergies as realized, and again including integration cost. We also expect this combination to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.
We will also be able to accelerate approximately $10 billion of Level 3 NOLs. These NOLs will significantly reduce the combined company's net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow. With that greater financial flexibility, we expect to significantly lower CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio, and this combination also positions us well for future growth. Together, we expect to be able to leverage Level 3's and CenturyLink's strong product portfolios across our combined customer bases. In addition, the increased network scale will provide advantages for our customers in numerous ways.
Going to Slide 8.  The transaction is structured in cash and stock, which we believe provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the upside of the combination as we work to realize the significant and compelling benefits of the transaction. CenturyLink will acquire Level 3 for $66.50 per share, which assumed a 60% stock consideration at $40 per share and 40% cash consideration at $26.50 per share. There's implied equity purchase price of approximately $24 billion and an enterprise value of $34 billion. 
Based on those numbers today -- based on those numbers, today's deal represents a premium of approximately 42% based on Level 3's unaffected share price. Once completed, the pro forma company is expected to be approximately 51% owned by CenturyLink shareholders and about 49% owned by Level 3 shareholders. Importantly, the combined company intends to maintain CenturyLink's annual dividend of $2.16 per share. In terms of financing, we have approximately $10.2 billion of financing in place, including a $2 billion unfunded revolver at close. 
Following the close of the transaction, I will continue as Chief Executive Officer and President, and we're pleased to have Sunit Patel join us as Chief Financial Officer. Following almost 35 years of -- at CenturyLink, Stewart Ewing has decided to retire following the close of this transaction. Stewart's been an important -- really a vital part of our company, of this transaction and every other deal we've completed over the years. He is committed to seeing us through the integration and closing with Level 3. Stewart's a great leader. He is a good friend and our company is much stronger due to his many valuable contributions over the years.
In terms of board composition, the Chairman of CenturyLink's Board of Directors at the time of close will continue to serve as chairman of the combined company. CenturyLink has agreed to appoint 4 Level 3 board members, one of whom will be a representative of STT Crossing Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Telemedia. We'll discuss the pathway to closing in detail later in the presentation, but we expect the transaction to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject of course to the receipt of regulatory approval, shareholder votes and other customary closing conditions. STT Crossing Ltd., which holds 18% of Level 3, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. 
With that I'll now hand the call over to Jeff. Before I do that, I just -- I do want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. We've long admired Level 3, and I'm excited to -- that we are now combining forces. Jeff?"

I'm very excited to be here today with Glen and his team announcing this combination. As you can see from Slide 9, we are 2 strong enterprise-focused companies coming together to build an even stronger company, able to address the evolving and growing needs of our customers. As Glen mentioned, we believe this is great transaction for our stockholders, customers, employees and industry partners.
As I look at the enterprise marketplace, there are a number of trends that will shape the future of communications. First of all, the demand for bandwidth continues to escalate. The move to IT and IT-based services is not slowing, but accelerating. With the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices will explode over the coming years. Hybrid computing architectures used by enterprises are driving the introduction of hybrid wide-area networking solutions that bring together multiple technologies to meet customer demand. The advent of technologies like SDN and NFV are redefining the ways customers interface with their networks. And lastly, the need to address all of these trends on a global basis.
The combination of these 2 great companies will enhance our ability to meet the opportunities that these trends create. Whether looking at the network footprint or the breadth of the combined product portfolio, this combined company will provide tremendous benefits to our customers.
CenturyLink's managed services portfolio with Level 3's CDN and IP VPN capabilities all delivered over an extensive local and even global network. Our ability to use advanced threat intelligence and security services delivered by the combined company. This creates a company that will offer customers industry-leading capabilities over a world-class network. 
I'd like to take a minute to give my perspective on why this is a compelling transaction for Level 3 stockholders and why our Board of Directors unanimously approved this transaction. First of all, the purchase price is a premium to where our stock has been trading over the last year, with a meaningful portion of the consideration in cash. Shareholders also have the ability to participate in the upside of the powerful company we are creating together.
I truly believe that our ability to serve enterprise customers will be second-to-none. Communications is a scale business, and the combination of our substantial networks and platforms will enable us to deliver services to our customers more efficiently and effectively than either company could alone. I believe that our ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a result of this transaction. 
Before I turn the call over to Glen I'd like to thank the Level 3 employees for their hard work through the years and into the future. Your dedication, vision for the company we are today and your unwavering commitment to our customers has built a great company. I feel lucky to be a part of such an incredible group of employees and I'm excited to see what the future brings for us. Thank you.

As you can see, CenturyLink and Level 3's businesses are highly complementary. And once the transaction closes, stakeholders will benefit from a more diverse business mix, with pro forma revenue of $24.7 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue, and total core revenue of $24.2 billion, which excludes CenturyLink's other revenue and data integration revenue. Under these assumptions, we expect more than 75% of our revenues to come from business customers and 65% of our revenues will be strategic revenue.
As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, we will also have the ability to enhance the service and connectivity we provide CenturyLink's large enterprise customer base across Level 3's global footprint. Given the complementary nature of the product portfolios, the combined company will offer an even broader range of services and solutions to meet the demand for bandwidth and new applications in an increasingly complex operating environment.
Turning now to Slide 11.  As you can see, a key differentiator for our company will be that, of the top service providers in the country, we have by far the greatest percentage of our business focused on enterprise customers, and we will become the second-largest competitive provider of network services to businesses in the United States. 
Now turning to Slide 12.  We highlight the significant total cash synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction, with $975 million of what we believe are very achievable annual operating and capital synergies. We expect approximately $850 million in annual operating cost synergies, mostly from corporate network and operational efficiencies and IT systems consolidation, along with purchasing synergies across our advertising and marketing efforts. And we believe we can realize 80% of this annual run rate savings within 36 months after closing.
Our anticipated approximately $125 million in annual CapEx cash savings will come from purchasing synergies, which we expect to be -- to realize fully within 36 months. We currently anticipate our onetime integration cost to achieve these cash savings will be approximately $685 million, with a majority to be incurred between closing and year-end 2019. Both of our companies have significant M&A experience and a strong track record of execution, with a proven ability to integrate and meet or exceed synergy targets. This gives us real confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our 2 companies.
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to discuss the financial profile of the new company. Stewart?"

Expanding on what Glen outlined earlier, as you can see on Slide 13, the result of this transaction is a combined company with meaningful scale and financial strength, which will enable us to grow and capitalize on these synergy opportunities. The combined company's capital structure will benefit from a strong liquidity profile, including an approximately $2 billion unfunded revolver, free cash flow accretion, with a focus on sustainable free cash flow growth and improvements in our long-term dividend payout ratio.
Our expected free cash flow generation will grant us a flexibility to continue to deliver solid returns, while positioning us to invest in strategic growth initiatives and opportunities, allowing us to better compete in the complex operating environment. On a pro forma basis we expect the combined company to have net leverage of approximately 3.7x and our long-term leverage target remains at approximately 3x.
Turning to Slide 14.  This is an overview of the pro forma arch structure, depicting the combination and the associated new debt raised. The acquisition is structured such that Level 3 will be a subsidiary of CenturyLink, post-acquisition. Level 3's current debt will stay in place, and existing Level 3 entities will not incur or guarantee any acquisition debt. Based on expected ratings, change of control puts in the existing Level 3 debt will not be triggered. No consents are required from Level 3 lenders or note-holders for closing the acquisition.  
All the new acquisition debt will be raised at CenturyLink, and will rank ahead of the existing CenturyLink notes by virtue of expected guarantees from material nonregulated CenturyLink subs, including the EMBARQ parent and the newly created Level 3 holdco. The new debt will also benefit from the expected pledge of stock of QC and Level 3 Communications Inc. QC, a regulated entity, will not guarantee or provide explicit support for any new indebtedness.
Purchase price will be funded by cash on hand at closing for both CenturyLink and Level 3, as well as committed financing of $10.2 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley financing, which includes a $2 billion revolver and $1.2 billion commitment to address upcoming maturities between signing and closing, resulting in incremental funded debt for the transaction of approximately $7 billion.

Now turning to Slide 16.  And to conclude our remarks pertaining to the transaction, before touching on our quarterly earnings, we're confident in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of this transaction and the many benefits it will bring to CenturyLink and Level 3 stakeholders. The combined company will provide our customers with the network they need to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses.
For employees of both companies, we believe this combination will also provide additional growth and advancement opportunities over the years to come, and I look forward to continue to work with our best-in-class team, welcoming the talented members of the Level 3 team.  We're truly excited about CenturyLink and Level 3's future as a combined company and sharing those benefits with all stakeholders as we move forward with this exciting combination.
As we transition to third quarter results -- earnings results, I want to provide a few high-level comments about CenturyLink's third quarter results before turning it over to Stewart. We continue to see the benefits of our operational initiatives and network-first focus, and we are making progress on our broadband enablement road map, which we believe is critical to meeting our customer's long-term growing demand for bandwidth. We remain focused on continuing our pivot to higher-quality broadband customers. And while we still have more improvement to achieve on a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter we added higher ARPU customers, lower churn and fewer high credit risk -- high-risk credit customers in the quarter. So we're making that pivot with our consumer base, and we saw those results -- those trends in the third quarter.
Business strategic service revenues grew 5% year-over-year, led by more than 6% growth in high-speed -- high-bandwidth data service revenues. Business revenue was negatively impacted by churn, along with a renewal of several large customers in the quarter, which included some repricing impact. However, we are pleased with these renewals that will help us to maintain long-term relationships and re-contract a significant amount of revenue over extended terms.
And lastly, we are pursuing a number of activities with lower expenses, including a significant reduction in nonemployee-related expenses, and also a reduction of 7% to 8% in employee-related costs. We remain focused on continuing -- excuse me, these cost reductions are part of our continued effort to keep costs in line with our revenue streams, will position us for the legacy revenue pressures going into 2017. 
With that I'll turn it over to Stewart."
260149,402278150,1067702,"CenturyLink, Inc., Level 3 Communications, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding s",877,"Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the third quarter results and provide an overview of fourth quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release this morning. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. 
Now let's dive in. Today, CenturyLink reported solid third quarter results with total and core revenues, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS all within our guidance range. Third quarter operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 3.8% decrease from third quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues and a decrease of approximately $100 million in high-cost support revenues due to onetime out-of-period CAF Phase 2 support payments recognized in the third quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher strategic services revenues. Overall, strategic revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year. 
Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.92 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago period. Operating income was $595 million for the third quarter 2016, while we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion during the quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income, was $186 million for the quarter.
You may remember last quarter, we had said that we expected higher cash taxes in the third quarter, as the tax payment was deferred from the second quarter. In addition, we made a voluntary pension contribution of $100 million during the third quarter. These 2 items accounted for over $400 million of lower free cash flow in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter.
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.28, a decrease from $0.37 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.56, a decrease from $0.70 in the third quarter a year ago. 
Now moving to Slide 19, in our Business segment. In the third quarter the Business segment generated $2.61 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $30 million or 1.1% from the same period a year ago. Legacy revenues from the segment declined 7.6% from third quarter last year due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Third quarter strategic revenue for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to third quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services.
On a sequential quarter basis, we had a headwind from the onetime favorable settlement of approximately $10 billion -- $10 million that was reported in high-bandwidth data services in the second quarter of this year. Data integration revenues increased $10 million from third quarter 2015, due primarily to higher CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses increased $16 million or 1% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by CPE costs related to the higher data integration revenues.
Now turning to Slide 20, the Consumer segment generated $1.47 billion  in operating revenues, a decrease of $37 million or 2.5% from third quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 3.4% year-over-year to $789 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 8.3% from third quarter a year ago, reflecting access line declines and lower long-distance revenues. Our operating expenses increased $19 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to higher content costs related to our Prism TV service.
Now turning to Slide 21. For fourth quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.28 billion to $4.34 billion, core revenues of $3.86 billion to $3.92 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.58 billion and $1.64 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.59. In fourth quarter we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues and data integration revenues, resulting in lower fourth quarter 2016 operating revenues compared to third quarter of 2016.
Fourth quarter 2016 operating cash flow is expected to be relatively flat compared to third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues being offset by lower operating expenses, primarily related to the seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs, along with anticipated lower personnel and CPE costs. Additionally, as it pertains to the fourth quarter, we expect to incur severance costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million, related to planned headcount reductions.
These severance costs will be treated as a special item and are therefore excluded from fourth quarter guidance ranges provided. As the fourth quarter guidance implies, we are currently expecting to come in below full-year 2016 guidance ranges previously provided for certain financial metrics. This is primarily due to the weakness that we've experienced in customer units during the third -- second and third quarter. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid-60% range now for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to briefly discuss Level 3's third quarter results."

During the quarter, the benefits of our operating leverage and focus on profitable growth drove solid bottom-line performance. Margins continued to expand, and we saw solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. However, from an enterprise core network services revenue perspective, I'm still not happy with our results. We did not see the improvement in CNS enterprise revenue growth in North America or in EMEA that we expect. Since our second quarter call, we've spent quite a bit of time analyzing our own performance and addressing the issues we've identified. I will let Sunit go into the numbers, but I'll share a few thoughts about North America before handing the call over to him. 
First of all, a logical question is whether the revenue slowdown is associated with a lack of market opportunity for the types of products and services we sell. The answer to this is a firm and clear no. We continue to see market opportunity and demand for the services we provide. As examples, demand for transport services such as waves and dark fiber is strong, and we remain very capable in selling and delivering these services to customers.
Cloud Connect Solutions, IT services, IP VPNs and hybrid LANs continue to address a key need in the marketplace. As a reminder, hybrid LANs are the unique ways we combine a mix of public and private networking services to address customers' desires to support hybrid computing architectures. As a final example, our ability to wrap security, managed services and professional services around these products is a key differentiator and is also well-received within the market.
I have a great deal of confidence that the market opportunity remains attractive, that our competitive position is strong, that we have the right products and services to meet the needs of this market and that the market is moving toward Level 3's strength and capabilities, not away from us. If you look at the revenue growth from our large multinational customers and the higher-end customers of our target market, you can see that our value proposition clearly resonates with these customers.
As further evidence, in general sales are good. However our churn is too high. Over the past year and a half, we've made a number of decisions that were relatively small in isolation but have had the cumulative effect of pressuring revenue, particularly with the lower end of the base. These decisions can be broadly grouped into 2 categories. The first, our efforts to move upmarket. I still believe this is the right decision, but as I look back, we made a couple of mistakes that created customer coverage issues. First of all, we took a very aggressive approach and moved 8,000 customers to inside sales. Frankly, we didn't do it as well as we should have and created a communication void at the low end of our customer base.
With slightly larger customers, but still at the small end, we left those customers in the field sales organization but really lost focus on them as we asked our direct sales force to move upmarket. Again creating a communication void with these customers. Sunit will share the numbers, but as a result, we saw elevated churn from both of these groups of customers. 
The second set of decisions were centered on evolving and rationalizing our product set. We firmly believe in our capabilities and are excited about moving customers to new technologies. We see great acceptance in the marketplace for these capabilities. However, coupling our desire to move upmarket, with higher sales quotas we assigned to the sales team and with compensation plans rewarding sales more than revenue, we transitioned our customers more rapidly than they would have moved on their own. While we recognize the transition to new technologies is good for our business, accelerating your own customers' transitions faster than their natural rate results in more work for your operations team while producing a net write-down in revenue. We saw this dynamic affect customers across the various groups Sunit will discuss. 
If I can go back, I'd make some of these decisions differently. But being an aggressive company, we move fast and lean into growth. Going forward, we have a number of initiatives to address the issues we found. We are implementing a customer retention group within our sales -- inside sales and our field sales organizations to retain customers more effectively. We're augmenting our staff to reach out more frequently and communicate more effectively with smaller customers. We are reestablishing our focus on adding new logos.  We've lost a little bit of attention to this.
We are directing our teams to aggressively renew existing services with smaller customers rather than in sending sales or the customers to transition to new solutions today. We still want to transition to new services, but at their natural rate, not in an artificially accelerated rate because of the unintended consequences of other decisions. In addition, we've realigned our sales compensation, more heavily weighting revenue than sales. We've made process and organizational and structural changes designed to enhance the customer experience in service delivery and service assurance. While I'm optimistic about these changes, churn is a lagging indicator and they will take time to deliver results.
Before I turn the call over to Sunit to provide the detailed financial results, I'd like to sum up by saying we are intently focused on improving enterprise revenue performance. We believe the market opportunity is strong, our value proposition resonates with our customers, and that it's within our own execution to improve revenue growth. 
With that I'll turn the call over to Sunit."

As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation",664,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff just mentioned, we had a mix quarter with solid bottom-line performance, highlighted on Slide 23, by continued margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and strong free cash flow generation offset by softness in North America enterprise revenue performance. Overall, total revenue grew 0.4% and CNS revenue grew 1.1%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. government, grew 3.7%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 10%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 4.2%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects.
I'll now shift to our regional results, which can be found on Slide 24. North America CNS revenue grew 1.4% year-over-year. Enterprise CNS revenue grew 3.1%, driven by solid performance from our largest customers, offset by continued pressure from the low end of our base. As Jeff explained, revenue performance at the high end of our customer base is performing well. The challenges we've seen this year are really from the lower end of the base. As you can see on Slide 25, our largest global accounts customers, who make up 17% of our North America Enterprise CNS revenue, grew 1.9% sequentially. In the next year, customers that spend more than $20,000 per month grew 1.2% sequentially. Customers who spend $2,000 -- between $2,000 and $20,000 per month declined 0.6% sequentially. Finally, our smallest customers, spending less than $2,000 per month and representing 5% of the North America enterprise base, declined 18% sequentially.
Moving to EMEA, CNS revenue declined 7.7% with enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, declining 3.7%. In the region, we've been successful with large multinational customers, but they usually order more complex services with longer installation intervals. Higher churn continues to be a challenge for the EMEA region, and we have implemented several improvement initiatives to improve churn. For the past couple of quarters, we've experienced weakness in conferencing, co-location and lower-speed services.
Going forward, we are transitioning the business to focus on higher-bandwidth On-Net services. Usage revenues also weakened in the third quarter, driven by some large IP customer re-rates. We expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. Overall in EMEA, we are encouraged as enterprise CNS sales bookings in EMEA are up about 40% year-to-date compared to 2015, and we expect improved revenue performance in the coming quarters. 
In Latin America, we saw strong enterprise performance, driven in part by the Olympics. CNS enterprise revenue grew 16%, or 13% if you exclude the benefits from the Olympics, which was about $4 million in the third quarter. For the quarter, our overall sales bookings for the company were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and our sales funnel remains healthy. From a product group perspective, IP and data services grew 3%; transport and fiber declined 1%; voice services grew 0.4%; and co-location and data services revenue declined 0.2% year-over-year. From an individual product perspective, dark fiber grew 5%, CDN grew 15%, and managed security grew 16%.
Turning to Slide 26.  Adjusted EBITDA was $716 million for the third quarter of 2016. This compares to $641 million in the third quarter of 2015. The double-digit percentage improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the improvement in network-access costs, along with tighter management of operating expenses. We also continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margin, which improved nicely to 35.2% in the third quarter 2016 compared to 31.5% in the third quarter 2015.  
Year to date, capital expenditures were approximately 17% of total revenue. During the quarter, capital spending was higher than previous quarters, as we invested to meet stronger demand from fiber and wavelength sales. The company generated free cash flow of $281 million in the quarter compared to $237 million from the year-ago quarter. 
In summary, we remain focused on our revenue performance and have multiple initiatives in place to drive growth. We are excited about the combination with CenturyLink and look forward to what lies ahead.

And from that point, we went forward and did a lot of work, and -- over the last several months, and realized that it came to a place we were able to put -- get our companies together. And the structure came about after a long process of negotiating price and structure and all this over a long period of time. But it's been a -- I appreciate Jeff and his team.  They've been great to work with and we're looking forward to this, leading the transaction. Jeff, you want to..."

But there are also the market benefits that I talked about in deciding that we should put the 2 companies together. If you think about those market trends that I mentioned in the prepared comments, every one of those are addressed better by CenturyLink and Level 3 joining forces and building those capabilities together rather than going after them alone. And so as we look at the market and we say how do we win best, how do we not only capture the synergies and take advantage of those types of things, but how do we deliver our products better, how do we deliver our services more effectively to customers, each one of those trends are addressed very effectively by this combination."

But when we talk about our revenue growth, we have very clear expectations for what's acceptable and where we think we can be. And we look very diligently at what is -- what are those opportunities and are we executing on them effectively. So looking forward, as I mentioned in the -- earlier, I am very focused on making sure that we addressed some of the decisions we made that moved us and our focus away from the smaller-end customers. That's been our problem. And if you look at the results that Sunit shared, it very clearly points out that it's not a problem in the market, it's not a problem with our products and services. Our higher-end customers, where we are focused, have been growing and growing nicely. Now the lower-end customers, where we took our eye off them, when you stop talking to customers, when you create that communication void, they start to look for other solutions. And we just need to make sure that we are talking to them effectively. We know these are not customers that are early adopters for products and services, but that you have to stay focused on them if you want to maintain them. And so our revenue initiatives are more around churn control. We always want to drive sales and we always want to drive the top line growth. The bigger challenge for us right now is that churn in the smaller end of the base. Now Sunit also pointed out that, that small end of the base represents 5% of our revenue. And I'd also point out it's one of the strengths of CenturyLink, looking after those customers. And so we think there are things about this deal that are very, very good for our ability to grow revenue, not only over the course of the next year until this deal closes in the fall of 2017, but beyond that."

How should we think about the pace of progress in getting there? And then, clearly when we do the math -- and you'd mentioned, clearly you're looking at a lower payout ratio going forward. How should we think about sort of capital allocation strategy? Is it primarily focused on de-leveraging the combined balance sheet? Is there an opportunity to grow the dividend? Is it more focused on some of the capital expenditure initiatives that you folks had mentioned in terms of driving the longer-term growth value proposition of the joint entity? Would love color from that perspective."

So it takes about -- it'll take about 4 years or so for us to get back down to an EBITDA ratio of 3:1 -- 3 to 4 years, which we anticipate we can do. But the good thing about that, it de-levers from the free cash flow that's generated as well as the increasing EBITDA that we expect to have as a result of both growth in the customer base as well as the synergies that we expect to receive. So -- and achieve. The good thing about this is that because we de-lever so quickly, it'll give us the luxury of investing where we need to invest to be able to grow our business together faster than we can grow our business separately. From a dividend standpoint, we haven't really discussed increasing the dividend. But again, the dividend payout ratio will decline pretty significantly from 2018, which would be the first full year that we would expect to be together, out through 2021."

There's kind of a lot of overlap in the long-haul networks. Is there ability over time to maybe realize more synergies from shutting down one or the other of the long-haul networks and -- just any thoughts. Because the synergy number at 3% of revenue seems a little bit low, but obviously both companies have huge experience here with synergies, but it does seem low."

But a lot of our -- of the network is not overlap, it's really getting us to new areas, new countries and different parts of the U.S., giving us more options. I'll also add that with the Level 3 network, they have a lot of conduit available, which reduces the cost of build in these areas significantly down to like $0.50 a foot now, when you're just pulling fiber through conduit. So tremendous potential there, value creation over time with that asset. But right now, we feel like we've gone through the synergies pretty aggressively. And if there aren't more network synergies there, but we've -- the ones we've identified, we're very confident we'll achieve. Stewart, do you want to add anything or Jeff?"

We've acquired a bunch of companies. We've looked at shutting down networks. Sometimes that makes sense. But we're very good at capturing synergies. Both companies have demonstrated a capability over time to do this. And so we're very confident about those. But network rationalization is more about converting off-net to on-net. And that really has a triple benefit to us. First of all, when we convert off-net to on-net, we control the customer experience end to end.  We provide a better customer experience. We save money. We're no longer paying somebody else to provide that service for us. And we reduce the revenue of our competitors, because we're no longer paying our competitors to provide that service. And so we focus very aggressively, and I think both companies have this history, focus very aggressively on network rationalization. But it's is usually moving from other competitors on to our backbone to provide a better customer experience."

It increases our network reach. The combined company will have 75,000 on-net buildings. We'll have expanded products and services, solutions really to meet the global enterprise needs of customers. And we will have -- we'll create significant synergies, again, $175 million in cash synergies. We'll have nearly $10 billion in net operating losses to offset our cash taxes. We create the ability to de-lever from 3.7x, including run rate synergies, to 3x or less within 4 years of closing. This transaction significantly improves our dividend payout ratio, approximately 60% level within 4 years post-closing. It strengthens our liquidity profile, including being accretive to free cash flow per share in the first year.
So overall, this is a great transaction, I believe, for both companies, in so many different levels, so many ways. So we're looking forward to the months ahead as we move toward the approval -- the proper approvals, bringing these companies together. 
I want to thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking with you further in the weeks and months ahead. Thank you."
