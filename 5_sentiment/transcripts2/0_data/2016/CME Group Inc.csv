I'm proud of our colleagues' hard work and the resulting performance during a challenging year for the financial services space.

I'm proud of our colleagues' hard work and the resulting performance during a challenging year for the financial services space. 
In 2015, we delivered product and technology innovation in multiple ways, and we also reduced cost by driving efficiency throughout the organization while improving our agility. 
We set multiple volume and revenue records last year with particular strength in energy and agricultural products. 
In terms of volumes, we captured market share during the year across multiple products. In our non-transaction-related business, we had double-digit growth within both market data and our portion of the S&P Dow Index business. Those 2 line items make up approximately 25% of our pretax income. 
We have consistently expanded our global participation and we had a record level of non-U.S. volume and revenue during the year. 
During Q4, non-U.S. trading volume growth outperformed the U.S, which has been a consistent trend. Electronic trading volume from outside the U.S. increased by 7% in 2015. The electronification of our options has been an important part of our success as well. 
In 2015, our electronic options volume jumped by 15% to more than 1.4 million contracts a day. Our revenues from electronic options has grown by more than 90% from 2012 to 223 million this past year. 
During this time, we have invested in system enhancements, new products and client educations, which are driving significant usage of our diverse suite of option products. 
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with rates. I'm pleased to say that we were able to expand our total interest rate futures options and swaps revenue to more than $900 million this year, up slightly from the past year. That compares to approximately $600 million in 2012 prior to the swaps carrying mandate. 
Within fixed income markets, I would be surprised to find others that saw that same upward trend. 
For example, as many of you know, FICC activity is down fairly significantly during the last 3 years. We remain actively engaged with our customers discussing the advantages of liquidity and capital efficiency that we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
One recent area of significant success is the launch of our Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures option contracts this month. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve. This is the exact sweet spot where a lot of activity is clustered. 
I'm happy to say that this launch has been the most successful start of a new contract in our long history of innovation despite an uncertain and volatile trading environment, which is usually a difficult time for a new product to garner any attention. With more than 140 market participants providing consistent liquidity across all regions, the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures has been trading more than 20,000 contracts a day over the last few weeks. 
Open interest has increased steadily since the launch and stands at more than 50,000 contracts, demonstrating this contract's relevance to our client base. Open interest in our actively traded 10-year Treasury Note features has grown by more than 10% since the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note launch to almost 3 million contracts, thereby expanding the entire interest rate complex. 
The world's largest and most complex options market is our Eurodollar options and total volume there was up 12% to almost 1 million contracts a day in 2015. 
The percentage of the volume on Globex increased each quarter during the year, from 14% in Q1 up to 22% in Q4. Our Eurodollar options average daily volume grew to more than 2.1 million contracts per day in January and record electronic Eurodollar options averaged more than 450,000 contracts per day, tripling the volume from a year ago. 
Turning to equities. A couple of items stand out. Within options, we saw a 7% volume increase during the year. 
Also in 2015, we were very pleased to secure long-term rights in the FTSE Russell indexes as a result of our partnership with the LSE. 
On January 25, we launched the FTSE emerging markets in Europe developed markets products, and we are looking forward to 2017 when the Russell 2000 launches in CME. And we think there is an opportunity to increase volumes meaningfully. 
Finally, last quarter, I mentioned we have launched basis traded index closed functionality for equity futures and S&P 500 dividend futures. 
Since the expansion of the so-called DTEC to the U.S. major indices in November last year, over 132,000 contracts have been traded. This is the business that has historically been done in the bilateral way of exchange. 
In commodities, we saw a record volume in energy and agricultural products. The impact of El Niño and the potential for La Niña, along with the normal dynamics, has resulted in increased usage of our products.  
We are particularly pleased with our results in energy. Our total energy revenue grew by 15% during the year, more than twice as fast as our closest competitor. We have taken share, include all futures and options, natural gas futures and options and within coal. 
During Q4, we were pleased to see the lifting of the 40-year ban on exporting crude outside the U.S. We think this bodes well for the long-term position of our energy complex and also within the metals complex, we achieved record levels of large open interest holders, and we picked up volume in market share from competing exchanges in gold, copper and iron ore. 
Within our earnings presentation, you'll find a summary slide, which highlights many of the initiatives we launched during 2015 to pave the way for continued growth on a global basis. I've gone through some of these in prior calls, so I won't go into any detail this morning. 
Turning to 2016. Our business has been quite active as volatility has picked up. We've had a great start to the year with a new record monthly ADV of 18.2 million in January and record energy volume. 
In addition, total options, including electronic options were well above previous levels. 
Related to options, there are many firms utilizing more complex trading strategies as the markets have become electronified. We are seeing enhanced liquidity within different strikes and expirations in many products as many market participants have more data and better tools to manage heightened levels of risk. 
There was an insightful report recently from the tap group on this very topic. Exchanges that have invested in meaningful options activity showed benefit on a going-forward basis. 
One more point on January, the volume from outside the U.S. was 26% of the total volume, up from the 24% we averaged during 2015. It is very nice to see the global participation and increased activity throughout the entire day. 
It is also worth noting that our open interest grew by 16.5 million contracts or 18% during the month of January compared to the year-end and all products have seen higher open interest. This is by far, the largest open interest increase we have seen from the prior month. 
In January, energy volume from outside of the U.S. grew by more than 80% versus the prior year, while equity volume rose more than 65%. 
While we don't provide guidance on our volume, we do know our product diversity is unmatched and has been very helpful over the years in different environment. We have had a large number of repeat clients who utilize our markets every day and an expanding number of new clients that we are pursuing with multiple sales campaigns. Clearly, there are diverging opinions related to volatility, global risk and political uncertainty. We don't control these things. Our work is centered on growing the number of tools available to our clients to help them manage their risk. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

CME had a solid fourth quarter and an excellent year. The full year revenue increased by 7%, while total adjusted expense was down by 1%.

The full year revenue increased by 7%, while total adjusted expense was down by 1%. 
During the year, we increased adjusted operating margins from 58% to 61%. Our adjusted EPS and net income year-over-year growth were both above 14% in 2015. 
In Q4 last year, we had the second highest volume in our history, which made for a tough comparison. I'll start with some revenue details for the fourth quarter. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.789, up 4% from $0.759 in Q3. 
Overall, we had an increased proportion of volume from higher paying nonmembers during the quarter and also had strong energy volume, which is one of our higher RPC products. 
The energy, RPC rebounded to $1.23 per contract, up $0.035 from the prior quarter due to positive mix shifts within the energy product line from lower price power to higher price natural gas contracts in energy swaps in ClearPort.  Nonmember activity in energy was also significant during the quarter. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $337 million, exactly where we guided. 
In terms of headcount, we ended the year with 2,530 employees, basically flat relative to the end of the third quarter. 
Our compensation ratio for the year came in at 16.1% compared to 17% in 2014. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $25 million in net earnings among consolidated subsidiaries, which is up 13% from the prior year. 
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME. 
Turning to taxes. For the full year, we ended at 36.4%, slightly below the 36.6% range we expected. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9%. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.87 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. 
In January, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders in our variable dividend. Earlier this week, we announced a 20% increase in our regular dividend, from $0.50 per share to $0.60. Our dividend yield over the last 4 years has been more than 5%, and we plan to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $28 million and for the full year, we came in at $113 million. 
Our build-out of our New York office space has been completed. We've also made reductions in our data center footprint, and we continue to examine opportunities for efficiency there. 
Looking ahead to guidance for 2016, let me start with operating expenses. We will continue to be as efficient as possible as we execute on our strategy with an eye to free up dollars to spend on growth initiatives. 
Going into 2016, we are providing guidance for total expense, excluding our licensing and other fee agreements. 
In 2015, our nonlicensed fee related expenses totaled $1.171 billion. Based on our current plans and business mix, I expect that to increase by a modest 1% to approximately $1.185 billion. 
As many of you know, the forecasted license fees are driven by your assumptions on equities, energy and other cleared swaps volumes. 
In terms of revenue, as a reminder, we implemented the 2016 transaction fee increase across all 6 product areas beginning in January, and we expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels in product mix. 
In addition, our market data clients who previously received a fee waiver are moving from $42.50 per month per screen to $85 per month per screen, which is the same level our other customers currently pay. We expect our market data revenue to increase by 4% to 5% in 2016. 
A couple of additional items. For modeling purposes, at this point, I expect taxes to be at a similar level to 2015 at 36.5%. I expect CapEx to come in between $115 million and $120 million in 2016. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to execute our efficiency program that we started last year to reduce operating expenses to pay for new growth initiatives, reduce the unit cost of critical systems by keeping cost flat, while increasing capacity and by leveraging more software and infrastructure as a service, which tends to flow through expenses rather than capital expenditures. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this year throughout the company. As you know, operating leverage in our business is significant and that was clearly evidenced this year. We plan to continue to grow our top line and drive as much revenue to our bottom line as possible and into our healthy growing dividend stream. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

It's been very exciting over the last few years in terms of -- what we've seen in terms of compliance transitioning from swaps over futures. If you recall early last year, Greenwich Associates published a study looking at our interest rate futures on total cost analysis basis relative to the swaps marketplace. And saw that our treasury futures, our Eurodollar futures, our Deliverable Swap Futures, on a consistent basis, offer you the same risk profile or similar risk profile to its trade swaps at a far lower cost. So it seems since 2012 when the mandate clearance rate got kicked in, a big increase, for example, in our penetration of the cash treasury bond market. So treasury futures back in 2012 traded 66% of the average daily volume of the cash driven bond market. Last year if you look at it, we were at 75%. So very significant increase in terms of our market share relative to rest of the marketplace. In fact last year because of the jump in the gap right relative to bond future, if you adjust for that duration jump, our equivalent penetration now of the cash treasury market is about 78%. So we continue to see progress. We continue to see migration into our trade marketplace. If you look actually this morning right over 62 million open interest in our interest rate futures complex, interest rate futures and options, a near record. so I'm very excited from that standpoint. On the interest swap side, continued innovation, continued innovation in the that marketplace. There were challenges right you last year relative to the CME basis relative to but continued innovation is allowing us to continue to get traction. So last year, we saw huge growth in our Mexican peso interest walk clearing, and we are now clearing approximately half of that marketplace. And then in December, we had our first rates in Brazilian real interest swaps. If you get the Mexican peso, since we are unique in offering that relative to the global marketplace, we are now clearing about half of the global Mexican peso interest rate swap market, and it's our third mostly important currency. Other exciting developments we're seeing is the tan future. So relative to the increases in regulation, the increases in costs, relative to capital requirements, banks, in particular, are [indiscernible] future is a very exciting new launch where we're seeing a migration into exciting new products. So the tan futures, the single most successful actually launch after the first few mix in history relative to ADV open interest and a number of large open interest holders. So already after 3 weeks, we're seeing 58,000 open interest this morning. We're seeing around 25,000 ADV recently and over 140 participants so very, very exciting. Now the increases that we're seeing, in particular, coming from asset managers hedge funds and corporates, asset managers last year actually outperformed to the rest of our market segments by about 9% in terms of their growth in our industry complex. So we see a continued migration. And we continuing to innovate on the swaps area. So with the Mexican peso and with the BRL, today we offer 19 currencies relative to our competition's 17 currencies. In addition to that, we do look to launch swaps options clearing earlier this year as another unique valuable position to marketplace offering, UniCredit and capital management tools."

One being our market data revenue, which we showed -- where we showed the increase about 4% to 5%, and we've also use the lever in terms of pricing in our transaction fees, so we provided a tremendous a lot of value to our clients, so we have a 2% increase across-the-board in our transaction fees. So when you take a look at the month of January, we've had a record volume for the month of January. We've seen large increases in our options complex.

There was actually an article out this morning on Bloomberg talking about a product that we just launched 9 months ago, the Look Storage contract, that reflects exactly the infrastructure shifts and the market dynamic shifts that are now reflective of WTI products. So we've got the participation levels not only did we had large open interest holder record levels in 2015, we actually saw a record levels of Chinese participation and revenue generation. In fact, the greatest revenue generator for us in China in 2015 was our Energy content. That 82% growth year-on-year there. So this is a product that the story is one of a globalize waterborne product. The market now, I think the first shift left actually the Gulf Coast last week and headed for Japan. So this is something we've been positioning for over the last 18 months or so. We put ourselves in a position with both the innovative new storage contract with Luke launched about 9 months ago. In addition to our globalizing sales efforts to make sure that wherever there is an interest in energies, we're going to make sure that we are pounding the pavement with our customers. And then finally unfazed 12 of the deck that we circulated, you mentioned the 22% of our energies revenue now come from outside U.S. That's up from just 18% last year, 2 years ago. So we're seeing significant growth in the participation in January, particularly as a continuation of that trend.

And I really believe that when you look at options growth, that what's preserves your futures contracts. So that's what continues to attract new features participants, so we've done a really good job of bolstering our options products with the growth that we've seen in them. They got to realize they don't turnover is much is our futures but what they do is they help the risk management product, which is a futures contract, and you need to have bigger growth in your options in order to garner more participants in your futures, and that's exactly what we're doing. So we expect that it always goes up and down, but this is something that I have never seen in my 36-year history to see the options growth outpace the futures growth, and that's a great healthy sign for this company."

So if you look at that actually on recent date, we've had dealers activity on our platform as much as 30% of the overall volumes. One thing I said before, again, if you look in addition to that, the migration over to the futures, I slightly misspoke. In 2012, we actually had 56% penetration of the cash chartered by market, 66% in 2013. And then last year, 75%. So we see also very large migration over into our futures."

I'm proud of our colleagues' hard work and the resulting performance during a challenging year for the financial services space.
In 2015, we delivered product and technology innovation in multiple ways, and we also reduced cost by driving efficiency throughout the organization while improving our agility.
We set multiple volume and revenue records last year, with particular strength in energy and agricultural products.
In terms of volumes, we captured market share during the year across multiple products. In our nontransaction-related business, we had double-digit growth within both market data and our portion of the S&P Dow Index business. Those 2 line items make up approximately 25% of our pretax income.
We have consistently expanded our global participation and we had a record level of non-U.S. volume and revenue during the year.
During Q4, non-U.S. trading volume growth outperformed the U.S, which has been a consistent trend. Electronic trading volume from outside the U.S. increased by 7% in 2015. The electronification of our options has been an important part of our success as well.
In 2015, our electronic options volume jumped by 15% to more than 1.4 million contracts a day. Our revenues from electronic options has grown by more than 90% from 2012 to 223 million this past year.
During this time, we have invested in system enhancements, new products and client education, which are driving significant usage of our diverse suite of option products.
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with rates. I'm pleased to say that we were able to expand our total interest rate futures options and swaps revenue to more than $900 million this year, up slightly from the past year. That compares to approximately $600 million in 2012 prior to the swaps carrying mandate.
Within fixed income markets, I would be surprised to find others that saw that same upward trend.
For example, as many of you know, FICC activity is down fairly significantly during the last 3 years. We remain actively engaged with our customers discussing the advantages of liquidity and capital efficiency that we are uniquely positioned to provide.
One recent area of significant success is the launch of our Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures and option contracts this past month. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve. This is the exact sweet spot where a lot of activity is clustered.
I'm happy to say that this launch has been the most successful start of a new contract in our long history of innovation despite an uncertain and volatile trading environment, which is usually a difficult time for a new product to garner any attention. With more than 140 market participants providing consistent liquidity across all regions, the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures has been trading more than 20,000 contracts a day over the last few weeks.
Open interest has increased steadily since the launch and stands at more than 50,000 contracts, demonstrating this contract's relevance to our client base. Open interest in our actively traded 10-year Treasury Note features has grown by more than 10% since the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note launch to almost 3 million contracts, thereby expanding the entire interest rate complex.
The world's largest and most complex options market is our Eurodollar options and total volume there was up 12% to almost 1 million contracts a day in 2015.
The percentage of the volume on Globex increased each quarter during the year, from 14% in Q1 up to 22% in Q4. Our Eurodollar options average daily volume grew to more than 2.1 million contracts per day in January and record electronic Eurodollar options averaged more than 450,000 contracts per day, tripling the volume from a year ago.
Turning to equities. A couple of items stand out. Within options, we saw a 7% volume increase during the year.
Also in 2015, we were very pleased to secure long-term rights to the FTSE Russell indexes as a result of our partnership with the LSE.
On January 25, we launched the FTSE emerging markets in Europe developed markets products, and we are looking forward to 2017 when the Russell 2000 launches in CME. And we think there is an opportunity to increase volumes meaningfully.
Finally, last quarter, I mentioned we have launched basis traded index closed functionality for equity futures and S&P 500 dividend futures.
Since the expansion of the so-called DTEC to the U.S. major indices in November last year, over 132,000 contracts have been traded. This is the business that has historically been done in the bilateral way of exchange.
In commodities, we saw a record volume in energy and agricultural products. The impact of El Niño and the potential for La Niña, along with the normal dynamics, has resulted in increased usage of our products.
We are particularly pleased with our results in energy. Our total energy revenue grew by 15% during the year, more than twice as fast as our closest competitor. We have taken share, include all futures and options, natural gas futures and options and within coal. 
During Q4, we were pleased to see the lifting of the 40-year ban on exporting crude outside the U.S. We think this bodes well for the long-term position of our energy complex and also within the metals complex, we achieved record levels of large open interest holders, and we picked up volume in market share from competing exchanges in gold, copper and iron ore.
Within our earnings presentation, you'll find a summary slide, which highlights many of the initiatives we launched during 2015 to pave the way for continued growth on a global basis. I've gone through some of these in prior calls, so I won't go into any detail this morning.
Turning to 2016. Our business has been quite active as volatility has picked up. We've had a great start to the year, with a new record monthly ADV of 18.2 million in January and record energy volume. 
In addition, total options, including electronic options were well above previous levels.
Related to options, there are many firms utilizing more complex trading strategies as the markets have become electronified. We are seeing enhanced liquidity within different strikes and expirations in many products as many market participants have more data and better tools to manage heightened levels of risk.
There was an insightful report recently from the tap [ph] group on this very topic. Exchanges that have invested in meaningful options activity showed benefit on a going-forward basis.
One more point on January, the volume from outside the U.S. was 26% of the total volume, up from the 24% we averaged during 2015. It is very nice to see the global participation and increased activity throughout the entire day.
It is also worth noting that our open interest grew by 16.5 million contracts or 18% during the month of January compared to the year-end and all products have seen higher open interest. This is by far, the largest open interest increase we have seen from the prior month.
In January, energy volume from outside of the U.S. grew by more than 80% versus the prior year, while equity volume rose more than 65%.
While we don't provide guidance on our volume, we do know our product diversity is unmatched and has been very helpful over the years in different environment. We have had a large number of repeat clients, who utilize our markets every day, and an expanding number of new clients that we are pursuing with multiple sales campaigns. Clearly, there are diverging opinions related to volatility, global risk and political uncertainty. We don't control these things. Our work is centered on growing the number of tools available to our clients to help them manage their risk.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

CME had a solid fourth quarter and an excellent year. The full year revenue increased by 7%, while total adjusted expense was down by 1%.During the year, we increased adjusted operating margins from 58% to 61",829,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. CME had a solid fourth quarter and an excellent year. The full year revenue increased by 7%, while total adjusted expense was down by 1%.
During the year, we increased adjusted operating margins from 58% to 61%. Our adjusted EPS and net income year-over-year growth were both above 14% in 2015.
In Q4 last year, we had the second highest volume in our history, which made for a tough comparison. I'll start with some revenue details for the fourth quarter. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.789, up 4% from $0.759 in Q3. 
Overall, we had an increased proportion of volume from higher paying nonmembers during the quarter and also had strong energy volume, which is one of our higher RPC products.
The energy, RPC rebounded to $1.23 per contract, up $0.035 from the prior quarter due to positive mix shifts within the energy product line from lower price power to higher price natural gas contracts in energy swaps in ClearPort.  Nonmember activity in energy was also significant during the quarter. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $337 million, exactly where we guided.
In terms of headcount, we ended the year with 2,530 employees, basically flat relative to the end of the third quarter.
Our compensation ratio for the year came in at 16.1% compared to 17% in 2014.
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $25 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is up 13% from the prior year.
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.
Turning to taxes. For the full year, we ended at 36.4%, slightly below the 36.6% range we expected. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.87 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities.
In January, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders in our variable dividend. Earlier this week, we announced a 20% increase in our regular dividend, from $0.50 per share to $0.60. Our dividend yield over the last 4 years has been more than 5%, and we plan to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders.
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $28 million and for the full year, we came in at $113 million.
Our build-out of our New York office space has been completed. We've also made reductions in our data center footprint, and we continue to examine opportunities for efficiency there.
Looking ahead to guidance for 2016, let me start with operating expenses. We will continue to be as efficient as possible as we execute on our strategy, with an eye to free up dollars to spend on growth initiatives. 
Going into 2016, we are providing guidance for total expense, excluding our licensing and other fee agreements.
In 2015, our nonlicensed fee related expenses totaled $1.171 billion. Based on our current plans and business mix, I expect that to increase by a modest 1% to approximately $1.185 billion.
As many of you know, the forecasted license fees are driven by your assumptions on equities, energy and other cleared swaps volumes.
In terms of revenue, as a reminder, we implemented the 2016 transaction fee increase across all 6 product areas beginning in January, and we expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels in product mix.
In addition, our market data clients who previously received a fee waiver are moving from $42.50 per month per screen to $85 per month per screen, which is the same level our other customers currently pay. We expect our market data revenue to increase by 4% to 5% in 2016.
A couple of additional items. For modeling purposes, at this point, I expect taxes to be at a similar level to 2015 at 36.5%. I expect CapEx to come in between $115 million and $120 million in 2016.
In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to execute our efficiency program that we started last year to reduce operating expenses to pay for new growth initiatives, reduce the unit cost of critical systems by keeping cost flat, while increasing capacity and by leveraging more software and infrastructure as a service, which tends to flow through expenses rather than capital expenditures.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this year throughout the company. As you know, operating leverage in our business is significant and that was clearly evidenced this year. We plan to continue to grow our top line and drive as much revenue to our bottom line as possible and into our healthy growing dividend stream.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

It's been very exciting over the last few years in terms of -- what we've seen in terms of clients transitioning from swaps over futures. If you recall early last year, Greenwich Associates published a study looking at our interest rate futures on total cost analysis basis relative to the swaps marketplace. And saw that our treasury futures, our Eurodollar futures, our Deliverable Swap Futures, on a consistent basis, offer you the same risk profile or similar risk profile to its trade swaps at a far lower cost. So it seems since 2012 when the mandate clearance rate swaps got kicked in, a big increase, for example, in our penetration of the cash treasury bond market. So treasury futures back in 2012 traded 66% of the average daily volume of the cash driven bond market. Last year, if you look at it, we were at 75%. So very significant increase in terms of our market share relative to rest of the marketplace. In fact, last year, because of the jump in the gap right relative to bond future, if you adjust for that duration jump, that were -- our equivalent penetration now of the cash treasury market is about 78%. So we continue to see progress. We continue to see migration into our trade marketplace. If you look actually this morning right over 62 million open interest in our interest rate futures complex, interest rate futures and options, a new record. So I'm very excited from that standpoint. On the interest swap side, continued innovation in the that marketplace. There were challenges last year relative to the CME basis relative to LCH, but continued innovation is allowing us to continue to get traction. So last year, we had -- saw huge growth in our Mexican peso interest rate swap clearing, and we are now clearing approximately half of that marketplace. And then in December, we -- which has had our first rates in Brazilian real creating interest swaps. If you get the Mexican peso, since we are unique in offering that relative to the global marketplace, we are now clearing about half of the global Mexican peso interest rate swap market, and it's our third mostly important currency. Other exciting developments we're seeing is the tan future. So relative to the increases in regulation, the increases in costs, relative to capital requirements, banks, in particular, a key end future, very exciting new launch where we're seeing a migration into exciting new products. So the tan futures, the single most successful, actually launched after the first few mix in history relative to ADV open interest and a number of large open interest holders. So already after 3 weeks, we're seeing 58,000 open interest this morning. We're seeing around 25,000 ADV recently and over 140 participants so very, very exciting. Now the increases that we're seeing, in particular, coming from asset managers hedge funds and corporates. Asset managers, last year, actually, outperformed to the rest of our market segments by about 9% in terms of their growth in our interest rate complex. So we see a continued migration. And we're continuing to innovate on the swaps area. So with the Mexican peso and with the BRL, today we offer 19 currencies relative to our competition's 17 currencies. In addition to that, we do look to launch swaps options clearing, earlier this year, as another unique value proposition to marketplace offering, unique credit and capital management tools."

One of the benefits of having the broad swap of interest rate products that we represent, we're able to reach the client base particularly within London. We brought in some new business, particularly in the shorter end of our yield curve that we just hadn't tapped before, and that's a strong testament to the product complex that we represent. Also, I think I alluded to earlier our intensified efforts on cross-selling. So from existing clients, what that means is, going in, working with them through strong rigorous marketing and education programs and helping existing users understand how we can complement their business, for example, with metal having them come in and do some activity into our foreign currency products to hedge their foreign currency risk. That has been very successful. So to be able to back that up, new business from existing customers, we've seen existing customers now trading over I think at 1,700 new products that they hadn't tried before. So it's new business from existing customers and then it's also new business from new customers, which I outlined earlier. Again, it's a combination of targeted sales, bringing together our marketing, our strategy and our business line units together to go out there and call that new business."

So we've done a really good job of bolstering our options products with the growth that we've seen in them.

I'm proud of our colleagues' hard work and the resulting performance during a challenging year for the financial services space.
In 2015, we delivered product and technology innovation in multiple ways, and we also reduced cost by driving efficiency throughout the organization while improving our agility.
We set multiple volume and revenue records last year, with particular strength in energy and agricultural products.
In terms of volumes, we captured market share during the year across multiple products. In our nontransaction-related business, we had double-digit growth within both market data and our portion of the S&P Dow Index business. Those 2 line items make up approximately 25% of our pretax income.
We have consistently expanded our global participation and we had a record level of non-U.S. volume and revenue during the year.
During Q4, non-U.S. trading volume growth outperformed the U.S, which has been a consistent trend. Electronic trading volume from outside the U.S. increased by 7% in 2015. The electronification of our options has been an important part of our success as well.
In 2015, our electronic options volume jumped by 15% to more than 1.4 million contracts a day. Our revenues from electronic options has grown by more than 90% from 2012 to 223 million this past year.
During this time, we have invested in system enhancements, new products and client education, which are driving significant usage of our diverse suite of option products.
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with rates. I'm pleased to say that we were able to expand our total interest rate futures options and swaps revenue to more than $900 million this year, up slightly from the past year. That compares to approximately $600 million in 2012 prior to the swaps carrying mandate.
Within fixed income markets, I would be surprised to find others that saw that same upward trend.
For example, as many of you know, FICC activity is down fairly significantly during the last 3 years. We remain actively engaged with our customers discussing the advantages of liquidity and capital efficiency that we are uniquely positioned to provide.
One recent area of significant success is the launch of our Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures and option contracts this past month. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve. This is the exact sweet spot where a lot of activity is clustered.
I'm happy to say that this launch has been the most successful start of a new contract in our long history of innovation despite an uncertain and volatile trading environment, which is usually a difficult time for a new product to garner any attention. With more than 140 market participants providing consistent liquidity across all regions, the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures has been trading more than 20,000 contracts a day over the last few weeks.
Open interest has increased steadily since the launch and stands at more than 50,000 contracts, demonstrating this contract's relevance to our client base. Open interest in our actively traded 10-year Treasury Note features has grown by more than 10% since the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note launch to almost 3 million contracts, thereby expanding the entire interest rate complex.
The world's largest and most complex options market is our Eurodollar options and total volume there was up 12% to almost 1 million contracts a day in 2015.
The percentage of the volume on Globex increased each quarter during the year, from 14% in Q1 up to 22% in Q4. Our Eurodollar options average daily volume grew to more than 2.1 million contracts per day in January and record electronic Eurodollar options averaged more than 450,000 contracts per day, tripling the volume from a year ago.
Turning to equities. A couple of items stand out. Within options, we saw a 7% volume increase during the year.
Also in 2015, we were very pleased to secure long-term rights to the FTSE Russell indexes as a result of our partnership with the LSE.
On January 25, we launched the FTSE emerging markets in Europe developed markets products, and we are looking forward to 2017 when the Russell 2000 launches on CME. And we think there is an opportunity to increase volumes meaningfully.
Finally, last quarter, I mentioned we have launched basis traded index closed functionality for equity futures and S&P 500 dividend futures.
Since the expansion of the so-called DTEC to the U.S. major indices in November last year, over 132,000 contracts have been traded. This is the business that has historically been done in the bilateral way of exchange.
In commodities, we saw a record volume in energy and agricultural products. The impact of El Niño and the potential for La Niña, along with the normal dynamics, has resulted in increased usage of our products.
We are particularly pleased with our results in energy. Our total energy revenue grew by 15% during the year, more than twice as fast as our closest competitor. We have taken share, include all futures and options, natural gas futures and options and within coal. 
During Q4, we were pleased to see the lifting of the 40-year ban on exporting crude outside the U.S. We think this bodes well for the long-term position of our energy complex and also within the metals complex, we achieved record levels of large open interest holders, and we picked up volume in market share from competing exchanges in gold, copper and iron ore.
Within our earnings presentation, you'll find a summary slide, which highlights many of the initiatives we launched during 2015 to pave the way for continued growth on a global basis. I've gone through some of these on prior calls, so I won't go into any detail this morning.
Turning to 2016. Our business has been quite active as volatility has picked up. We've had a great start to the year, with a new record monthly ADV of 18.2 million in January and record energy volume. 
In addition, total options, including electronic options, were well above previous levels.
Related to options, there are many firms utilizing more complex trading strategies as the markets have become electronified. We are seeing enhanced liquidity within different strikes and expirations in many products as many market participants have more data and better tools to manage heightened levels of risk.
There was an insightful report recently from the tap [ph] group on this very topic. Exchanges that have invested in meaningful options activity showed benefit on a going-forward basis.
One more point on January, the volume from outside the U.S. was 26% of the total volume, up from the 24% we averaged during 2015. It is very nice to see the global participation and increased activity throughout the entire day.
It is also worth noting that our open interest grew by 16.5 million contracts or 18% during the month of January compared to the year-end and all products have seen higher open interest. This is by far, the largest open interest increase we have seen from the prior month.
In January, energy volume from outside of the U.S. grew by more than 80% versus the prior year, while equity volume rose more than 65%.
While we don't provide guidance on our volume, we do know our product diversity is unmatched and has been very helpful over the years in different environments. We have had a large number of repeat clients, who utilize our markets every day, and an expanding number of new clients that we are pursuing with multiple sales campaigns. Clearly, there are diverging opinions related to volatility, global risk and political uncertainty. We don't control these things. Our work is centered on growing the number of tools available to our clients to help them manage their risk.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

CME had a solid fourth quarter and an excellent year. The full year revenue increased by 7%, while total adjusted expense was down by 1%.
During the year, we increased adjusted operating margins from 58% to 61%. Our adjusted EPS and net income year-over-year growth were both above 14% in 2015.
In Q4 last year, we had the second highest volume in our history, which made for a tough comparison. I'll start with some revenue details for the fourth quarter. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.789, up 4% from $0.759 in Q3. 
Overall, we had an increased proportion of volume from higher paying nonmembers during the quarter and also had strong energy volume, which is one of our higher RPC products.
The energy, RPC rebounded to $1.23 per contract, up $0.035 from the prior quarter due to positive mix shifts within the energy product line from lower price power to higher price natural gas contracts in energy swaps in ClearPort.  Nonmember activity in energy was also significant during the quarter. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $337 million, exactly where we guided.
In terms of headcount, we ended the year with 2,530 employees, basically flat relative to the end of the third quarter.
Our compensation ratio for the year came in at 16.1% compared to 17% in 2014.
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $25 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is up 13% from the prior year.
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.
Turning to taxes. For the full year, we ended at 36.4%, slightly below the 36.6% range we expected. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.87 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities.
In January, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders in our variable dividend. Earlier this week, we announced a 20% increase in our regular dividend, from $0.50 per share to $0.60. Our dividend yield over the last 4 years has been more than 5%, and we plan to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders.
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $28 million and for the full year, we came in at $113 million.
Our build-out of our New York office space has been completed. We've also made reductions in our data center footprint, and we continue to examine opportunities for efficiency there.
Looking ahead to guidance for 2016, let me start with operating expenses. We will continue to be as efficient as possible as we execute on our strategy, with an eye to free up dollars to spend on growth initiatives. 
Going into 2016, we are providing guidance for total expense, excluding our licensing and other fee agreements.
In 2015, our nonlicensed fee related expenses totaled $1.171 billion. Based on our current plans and business mix, I expect that to increase by a modest 1% to approximately $1.185 billion.
As many of you know, the forecasted license fees are driven by your assumptions on equities, energy and other cleared swaps volumes.
In terms of revenue, as a reminder, we implemented the 2016 transaction fee increase across all 6 product areas beginning in January, and we expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels in product mix.
In addition, our market data clients who previously received a fee waiver, are moving from $42.50 per month per screen to $85 per month per screen, which is the same level our other customers currently pay. We expect our market data revenue to increase by 4% to 5% in 2016.
A couple of additional items. For modeling purposes, at this point, I expect taxes to be at a similar level to 2015 at 36.5%. I expect CapEx to come in between $115 million and $120 million in 2016.
In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to execute our efficiency program that we started last year to reduce operating expenses to pay for new growth initiatives, reduce the unit cost of critical systems by keeping cost flat, while increasing capacity and by leveraging more software and infrastructure as a service, which tends to flow through expenses rather than capital expenditures.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this year throughout the company. As you know, operating leverage in our business is significant and that was clearly evidenced this year. We plan to continue to grow our top line and drive as much revenue to our bottom line as possible and into our healthy growing dividend stream.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

It's been very exciting over the last few years in terms of -- what we've seen in terms of clients transitioning from swaps over to futures. If you recall early last year, Greenwich Associates published a study looking at our interest rate futures on total cost analysis basis relative to the swaps marketplace. And saw that our treasury futures, our Eurodollar futures, our Deliverable Swap Futures, on a consistent basis, offer you the same risk profile or similar risk profile to its trade swaps at a far lower cost. So it seems since 2012 when the mandate clearance rate swaps got kicked in, a big increase, for example, in our penetration of the cash treasury bond market. So treasury futures back in 2012 traded 66% of the average daily volume of the cash driven bond market. Last year, if you look at it, we were at 75%. So very significant increase in terms of our market share relative to the rest of the marketplace. In fact, last year, because of the jump in the gap, right, relative to bond future, if you adjust for that duration jump, that were -- our equivalent penetration now of the cash treasury market is about 78%. So we continue to see progress. We continue to see migration into our trade marketplace. If you look actually this morning we're at over 62 million open interest in our interest rate futures complex -- interest rate futures and options, a near record. So I'm very excited from that standpoint. On the interest swap side, continued innovation in that marketplace. There were challenges last year relative to the CME basis relative to LCH, but continued innovation is allowing us to continue to get traction. So last year, we had -- saw huge growth in our Mexican peso interest rate swap clearing, and we are now clearing approximately half of that marketplace. And then in December, we had our first trades in Brazilian real cleared interest swaps. If you get the Mexican peso, since we are unique in offering that relative to the global marketplace, we are now clearing about half of the global Mexican peso interest rate swap market, and it's our third mostly important currency. Other exciting developments we're seeing is the TN [ph] future. So relative to the increases in regulation, the increases in costs, relative to capital requirements, on banks in particular, a key end future, very exciting new launch where we're seeing a migration into an exciting new product. So the TN futures, the single most successful, actually launched after the first few mix in history relative to ADV open interest and a number of large open interest holders. So already after 3 weeks, we're seeing 58,000 open interest this morning. We're seeing around 25,000 ADV recently and over 140 participants -- so very, very exciting. Now the increases that we're seeing, in particular, coming from asset managers hedge funds and corporates. Asset managers, last year, actually, outperformed to the rest of our market segments by about 9% in terms of their growth in our interest rate complex. So we see a continued migration. And we're continuing to innovate on the swaps area. So with the Mexican peso and with the BRL, today we offer 19 currencies relative to our competition's 17 currencies. In addition to that, we do look to launch swaps options clearing, earlier this year, as another unique value proposition to marketplace offering unique credit and capital management tools."

One being our market data revenue, which we showed was -- where we showed the increase about 4% to 5%, and then we've also used the lever in terms of pricing in our transaction fees. So we provided a tremendous amount of value to our clients, so we have a 2% increase in -- across-the-board in our transaction fees. So when you take a look at the month of January, we've had a record volume for the month of January. We've seen large increases in our options complex.

So we've got the participation levels, we -- not only did we hit large open interest holder record levels in 2015, we actually saw record levels of Chinese participation and revenue generation. In fact, the greatest revenue generator for us in China in 2015 was our energies complex. About 82% growth year-on-year there. So this is a product that the story is one of a globalizing waterborne product. The market now, I think the first shift had actually left the Gulf Coast last week and headed for Japan. So this is something we've been positioning for over the last 18 months or so. We put ourselves in a position, with both the innovative new storage contract with Luke launched about 9 months ago, in addition to our globalizing sales efforts to make sure that wherever there is an interest in energies, we're going to make sure that we are pounding the pavement with our customers. And then finally on Page 12 of the deck that we circulated, you'll actually notice the 22% of our energies revenue now come from outside the U.S. That's up from just 18% last year, 2 years ago.

Pat, we've been working on the equivalents issue for quite sometime now, and we've been working with Chairman, Tim Massad, actually since the day he has been sworn in into the administration to take the role at the CFTC. This has been a big issue. This has been a long road working through all the different issues. We feel very confident that we've gotten all the issues resolved. I met with the Chairman, along with Gill and Kim and a few other folks just a couple of days ago. And I assure you that Chairman Massad understands the magnitude of the potential market disruption if in fact, the United States -- the U.S. is not deemed equivalent prior to the February 21 frontloading date. So that being said, it gives us some comfort but we would like to see it ahead of time. That being said, we've seen some recent articles I think in Risk magazine, where a couple of banks have made comments as to what they may or may not do come February 21. And then you've heard from some other participants saying that they feel very confident and they're not overly concerned about this. This is an issue that we're very focused on, and we will stay focused on until it's granted. But again, I think the Chairman has recognized that there could be market disruptions and that would be the worst thing that could happen to, not only to the U.S. market, but to the European participation -- participants as well, if the equivalents is not granted to the United States. So we feel confident that we will get this done."

One of the benefits of having the broad swap of interest rate products that we represent, we're able to reach the client base particularly within London. We brought in some new business, particularly in the shorter end of our yield curve that we just hadn't tapped before, and that's a strong testament to the product complex that we represent. Also, I think I alluded to earlier, our intensified efforts on cross-selling. So from existing clients, what that means is, going in, working with them through strong rigorous marketing and education programs and helping existing users understand how we can complement their business, for example with metals, having them come in and do some activity into our foreign currency products to hedge their foreign currency risk. That has been very successful. So to be able to back that up, new business from existing customers, we've seen existing customers now trading over, I think, it's 1,700 new products that they hadn't tried before. So it's new business from existing customers and then it's also new business from new customers, which I outlined earlier.

I'm proud of our colleagues' hard work and the resulting performance during a challenging year for the financial services space.
In 2015, we delivered product and technology innovation in multiple ways, and we also reduced cost by driving efficiency throughout the organization while improving our agility.
We set multiple volume and revenue records last year, with particular strength in energy and agricultural products.
In terms of volumes, we captured market share during the year across multiple products. In our nontransaction-related business, we had double-digit growth within both market data and our portion of the S&P Dow Index business. Those 2 line items make up approximately 25% of our pretax income.
We have consistently expanded our global participation and we had a record level of non-U.S. volume and revenue during the year.
During Q4, non-U.S. trading volume growth outperformed the U.S, which has been a consistent trend. Electronic trading volume from outside the U.S. increased by 7% in 2015. The electronification of our options has been an important part of our success as well.
In 2015, our electronic options volume jumped by 15% to more than 1.4 million contracts a day. Our revenues from electronic options has grown by more than 90% from 2012 to 223 million this past year.
During this time, we have invested in system enhancements, new products and client education, which are driving significant usage of our diverse suite of option products.
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with rates. I'm pleased to say that we were able to expand our total interest rate futures options and swaps revenue to more than $900 million this year, up slightly from the past year. That compares to approximately $600 million in 2012 prior to the swaps carrying mandate.
Within fixed income markets, I would be surprised to find others that saw that same upward trend.
For example, as many of you know, FICC activity is down fairly significantly during the last 3 years. We remain actively engaged with our customers discussing the advantages of liquidity and capital efficiency that we are uniquely positioned to provide.
One recent area of significant success is the launch of our Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures and option contracts this past month. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve. This is the exact sweet spot where a lot of activity is clustered.
I'm happy to say that this launch has been the most successful start of a new contract in our long history of innovation despite an uncertain and volatile trading environment, which is usually a difficult time for a new product to garner any attention. With more than 140 market participants providing consistent liquidity across all regions, the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures has been trading more than 20,000 contracts a day over the last few weeks.
Open interest has increased steadily since the launch and stands at more than 50,000 contracts, demonstrating this contract's relevance to our client base. Open interest in our actively traded 10-year Treasury Note features has grown by more than 10% since the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note launch to almost 3 million contracts, thereby expanding the entire interest rate complex.
The world's largest and most complex options market is our Eurodollar options and total volume there was up 12% to almost 1 million contracts a day in 2015.
The percentage of the volume on Globex increased each quarter during the year, from 14% in Q1 up to 22% in Q4. Our Eurodollar options average daily volume grew to more than 2.1 million contracts per day in January and record electronic Eurodollar options averaged more than 450,000 contracts per day, tripling the volume from a year ago.
Turning to equities. A couple of items stand out. Within options, we saw a 7% volume increase during the year.
Also in 2015, we were very pleased to secure long-term rights to the FTSE Russell indexes as a result of our partnership with the LSE.
On January 25, we launched the FTSE emerging markets in Europe developed markets products, and we are looking forward to 2017 when the Russell 2000 launches on CME. And we think there is an opportunity to increase volumes meaningfully.
Finally, last quarter, I mentioned we have launched basis traded index closed functionality for equity futures and S&P 500 dividend futures.
Since the expansion of the so-called DTEC to the U.S. major indices in November last year, over 132,000 contracts have been traded. This is the business that has historically been done in the bilateral way of exchange.
In commodities, we saw a record volume in energy and agricultural products. The impact of El Niño and the potential for La Niña, along with the normal dynamics, has resulted in increased usage of our products.
We are particularly pleased with our results in energy. Our total energy revenue grew by 15% during the year, more than twice as fast as our closest competitor. We have taken share, include all futures and options, natural gas futures and options and within coal. 
During Q4, we were pleased to see the lifting of the 40-year ban on exporting crude outside the U.S. We think this bodes well for the long-term position of our energy complex and also within the metals complex, we achieved record levels of large open interest holders, and we picked up volume in market share from competing exchanges in gold, copper and iron ore.
Within our earnings presentation, you'll find a summary slide, which highlights many of the initiatives we launched during 2015 to pave the way for continued growth on a global basis. I've gone through some of these on prior calls, so I won't go into any detail this morning.
Turning to 2016. Our business has been quite active as volatility has picked up. We've had a great start to the year, with a new record monthly ADV of 18.2 million in January and record energy volume. 
In addition, total options, including electronic options, were well above previous levels.
Related to options, there are many firms utilizing more complex trading strategies as the markets have become electronified. We are seeing enhanced liquidity within different strikes and expirations in many products as many market participants have more data and better tools to manage heightened levels of risk.
There was an insightful report recently from the tap [ph] group on this very topic. Exchanges that have invested in meaningful options activity showed benefit on a going-forward basis.
One more point on January, the volume from outside the U.S. was 26% of the total volume, up from the 24% we averaged during 2015. It is very nice to see the global participation and increased activity throughout the entire day.
It is also worth noting that our open interest grew by 16.5 million contracts or 18% during the month of January compared to the year-end and all products have seen higher open interest. This is by far, the largest open interest increase we have seen from the prior month.
In January, energy volume from outside of the U.S. grew by more than 80% versus the prior year, while equity volume rose more than 65%.
While we don't provide guidance on our volume, we do know our product diversity is unmatched and has been very helpful over the years in different environments. We have had a large number of repeat clients, who utilize our markets every day, and an expanding number of new clients that we are pursuing with multiple sales campaigns. Clearly, there are diverging opinions related to volatility, global risk and political uncertainty. We don't control these things. Our work is centered on growing the number of tools available to our clients to help them manage their risk.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

CME had a solid fourth quarter and an excellent year. The full year revenue increased by 7%, while total adjusted expense was down by 1%.
During the year, we increased adjusted operating margins from 58% to 61%. Our adjusted EPS and net income year-over-year growth were both above 14% in 2015.
In Q4 last year, we had the second highest volume in our history, which made for a tough comparison. I'll start with some revenue details for the fourth quarter. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.789, up 4% from $0.759 in Q3. 
Overall, we had an increased proportion of volume from higher paying nonmembers during the quarter and also had strong energy volume, which is one of our higher RPC products.
The energy, RPC rebounded to $1.23 per contract, up $0.035 from the prior quarter due to positive mix shifts within the energy product line from lower price power to higher price natural gas contracts in energy swaps in ClearPort.  Nonmember activity in energy was also significant during the quarter. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $337 million, exactly where we guided.
In terms of headcount, we ended the year with 2,530 employees, basically flat relative to the end of the third quarter.
Our compensation ratio for the year came in at 16.1% compared to 17% in 2014.
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $25 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is up 13% from the prior year.
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.
Turning to taxes. For the full year, we ended at 36.4%, slightly below the 36.6% range we expected. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.87 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities.
In January, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders in our variable dividend. Earlier this week, we announced a 20% increase in our regular dividend, from $0.50 per share to $0.60. Our dividend yield over the last 4 years has been more than 5%, and we plan to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders.
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $28 million and for the full year, we came in at $113 million.
Our build-out of our New York office space has been completed. We've also made reductions in our data center footprint, and we continue to examine opportunities for efficiency there.
Looking ahead to guidance for 2016, let me start with operating expenses. We will continue to be as efficient as possible as we execute on our strategy, with an eye to free up dollars to spend on growth initiatives. 
Going into 2016, we are providing guidance for total expense, excluding our licensing and other fee agreements.
In 2015, our nonlicensed fee related expenses totaled $1.171 billion. Based on our current plans and business mix, I expect that to increase by a modest 1% to approximately $1.185 billion.
As many of you know, the forecasted license fees are driven by your assumptions on equities, energy and other cleared swaps volumes.
In terms of revenue, as a reminder, we implemented the 2016 transaction fee increase across all 6 product areas beginning in January, and we expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels in product mix.
In addition, our market data clients who previously received a fee waiver, are moving from $42.50 per month per screen to $85 per month per screen, which is the same level our other customers currently pay. We expect our market data revenue to increase by 4% to 5% in 2016.
A couple of additional items. For modeling purposes, at this point, I expect taxes to be at a similar level to 2015 at 36.5%. I expect CapEx to come in between $115 million and $120 million in 2016.
In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to execute our efficiency program that we started last year to reduce operating expenses to pay for new growth initiatives, reduce the unit cost of critical systems by keeping cost flat, while increasing capacity and by leveraging more software and infrastructure as a service, which tends to flow through expenses rather than capital expenditures.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this year throughout the company. As you know, operating leverage in our business is significant and that was clearly evidenced this year. We plan to continue to grow our top line and drive as much revenue to our bottom line as possible and into our healthy growing dividend stream.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

It's been very exciting over the last few years in terms of -- what we've seen in terms of clients transitioning from swaps over to futures. If you recall early last year, Greenwich Associates published a study looking at our interest rate futures on total cost analysis basis relative to the swaps marketplace. And saw that our treasury futures, our Eurodollar futures, our Deliverable Swap Futures, on a consistent basis, offer you the same risk profile or similar risk profile to its trade swaps at a far lower cost. So it seems since 2012 when the mandate clearance rate swaps got kicked in, a big increase, for example, in our penetration of the cash treasury bond market. So treasury futures back in 2012 traded 66% of the average daily volume of the cash driven bond market. Last year, if you look at it, we were at 75%. So very significant increase in terms of our market share relative to the rest of the marketplace. In fact, last year, because of the jump in the gap, right, relative to bond future, if you adjust for that duration jump, that were -- our equivalent penetration now of the cash treasury market is about 78%. So we continue to see progress. We continue to see migration into our trade marketplace. If you look actually this morning we're at over 62 million open interest in our interest rate futures complex -- interest rate futures and options, a near record. So I'm very excited from that standpoint. On the interest swap side, continued innovation in that marketplace. There were challenges last year relative to the CME basis relative to LCH, but continued innovation is allowing us to continue to get traction. So last year, we had -- saw huge growth in our Mexican peso interest rate swap clearing, and we are now clearing approximately half of that marketplace. And then in December, we had our first trades in Brazilian real cleared interest swaps. If you get the Mexican peso, since we are unique in offering that relative to the global marketplace, we are now clearing about half of the global Mexican peso interest rate swap market, and it's our third mostly important currency. Other exciting developments we're seeing is the TN [ph] future. So relative to the increases in regulation, the increases in costs, relative to capital requirements, on banks in particular, a key end future, very exciting new launch where we're seeing a migration into an exciting new product. So the TN futures, the single most successful, actually launched after the first few mix in history relative to ADV open interest and a number of large open interest holders. So already after 3 weeks, we're seeing 58,000 open interest this morning. We're seeing around 25,000 ADV recently and over 140 participants -- so very, very exciting. Now the increases that we're seeing, in particular, coming from asset managers hedge funds and corporates. Asset managers, last year, actually, outperformed to the rest of our market segments by about 9% in terms of their growth in our interest rate complex. So we see a continued migration. And we're continuing to innovate on the swaps area. So with the Mexican peso and with the BRL, today we offer 19 currencies relative to our competition's 17 currencies. In addition to that, we do look to launch swaps options clearing, earlier this year, as another unique value proposition to marketplace offering unique credit and capital management tools."

So you're right, we were expecting a very modest 1% increase in expenses. And I think what we're looking at is 2 drivers. One being our market data revenue, which we showed was -- where we showed the increase about 4% to 5%, and then we've also used the lever in terms of pricing in our transaction fees. So we provided a tremendous amount of value to our clients, so we have a 2% increase in -- across-the-board in our transaction fees. So when you take a look at the month of January, we've had a record volume for the month of January. We've seen large increases in our options complex. So the things that we laid out to do, growing internationally, growing our options complex, and we've taken the opportunity to adjust prices. So our top line is -- we're hitting on all levers there.

So we've got the participation levels, we -- not only did we hit large open interest holder record levels in 2015, we actually saw record levels of Chinese participation and revenue generation. In fact, the greatest revenue generator for us in China in 2015 was our energies complex. About 82% growth year-on-year there. So this is a product that the story is one of a globalizing waterborne product. The market now, I think the first shift had actually left the Gulf Coast last week and headed for Japan. So this is something we've been positioning for over the last 18 months or so. We put ourselves in a position, with both the innovative new storage contract with Luke launched about 9 months ago, in addition to our globalizing sales efforts to make sure that wherever there is an interest in energies, we're going to make sure that we are pounding the pavement with our customers.

And I assure you that Chairman Massad understands the magnitude of the potential market disruption if in fact, the United States -- the U.S. is not deemed equivalent prior to the February 21 frontloading date. So that being said, it gives us some comfort but we would like to see it ahead of time. That being said, we've seen some recent articles I think in Risk magazine, where a couple of banks have made comments as to what they may or may not do come February 21. And then you've heard from some other participants saying that they feel very confident and they're not overly concerned about this. This is an issue that we're very focused on, and we will stay focused on until it's granted. But again, I think the Chairman has recognized that there could be market disruptions and that would be the worst thing that could happen to, not only to the U.S. market, but to the European participation -- participants as well, if the equivalents is not granted to the United States.

Also, I think I alluded to earlier, our intensified efforts on cross-selling. So from existing clients, what that means is, going in, working with them through strong rigorous marketing and education programs and helping existing users understand how we can complement their business, for example with metals, having them come in and do some activity into our foreign currency products to hedge their foreign currency risk. That has been very successful. So to be able to back that up, new business from existing customers, we've seen existing customers now trading over, I think, it's 1,700 new products that they hadn't tried before.

It is an exceptional start to the year with a record quarterly average daily volume which is up 13% compared with an overall already strong first quarter last year. We had very balanced growth",1627,"Thank you Mr. Peschier, and the thank you all for joining us. It is an exceptional start to the year with a record quarterly average daily volume which is up 13% compared with an overall already strong first quarter last year. We had very balanced growth in both financial and commodity products, each up double digits. We track customer segment activity closely and in Q1, we had more than 10% growth from asset managers hedge funds, corporates, proprietary trading firms and retail points during the quarter. 
Volumes on banks was up 1% which is strong relative to the decrease in the overall trading businesses over each of the last few years. More recently, April activity has been fairly strong compared to last year end is up more than 20% in total. It is encouraging to see relatively good volumes as April has been our slowest month over the last 2 years.  Open interest remains elevated and it's up the significantly since the beginning of the year. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with the tremendous results of from outside of the U.S. during the first quarter. We had record quarterly non-U.S. volume by far as well as the highest proportion of the business from outside of the U.S. since we started tracking the information, with more than 25% in the first quarter compared to 23% in the first quarter of last year. 
In Europe, we had a very strong first quarter activity, with volume increasing 28% from 2.3 million contracts per day last year to more than $2.9 million per day this year. The increase was led by equities which jumped 70%, and energy was up almost 60%. 
In Asia, energy was up 75% and equities grew by about 70%, with metals rising more than 30%. Focusing on Asia for a moment, we have been discussing the opportunity to expand our user base to include Chinese firms and entities for many years. Our focus started primarily with intermediaries, and we are now engaging directly with asset managers, hedge funds and other entities there. We generally look at our trading data in terms of what we see through mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  In Q1, we reached approximately 200,000 contracts per day combined, which is up from 100,000 contracts per day in Q1 of 2014 and 125,000 contracts last year. 
Our most notable recent success is in our energy franchise, where we have seen mainland China average daily volume increase from less than 10,000 contracts in the middle of last year to more than 30,000 contracts in Q1. 
A highlight from Hong Kong activity is in our equity business, with average daily volume there more than doubling to almost 25,000 contracts per day in Q1. The surge in the volume is great to see, and we are very fortunate to have highly appealing products to offer these clients. Based on the challenges in China over the last year, we believe many of these firms are comfortable trading in our regulated markets and benefiting from the significant liquidity we have around the clock. 
Speaking of that, in addition to the country of origin information we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q1, volumes during Asian hours grew by almost 30%, while activity during European hours rose 60%. Liquidity begets liquidity, and we are displaying deeper electronic markets in both futures and more recently, options around the clock. 
Turning to our efforts in options, we remain a strong leader compared to other global exchanges with Q1 options volume hitting a record 3.5 million contracts per day which is up 22%, with electronic options average daily volume rising 26% to a record 1.8 million contracts. The continued electronification of our options franchise has enabled us to further globalize participation in our options markets, with our European Options volume up 36%, and Asian Options volumes up 25% in Q1. 
Our continued investment in systems enhancements, new products and client education are driving significantly increased usage of our options products from end user, with the volumes from hedge funds and asset managers up 34% and up 29%, respectively. 
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with interest rates. Volume rose up 9% to more than 8 million contracts a day and revenue increased by 14%, with Eurodollars leading the way. We hit record levels of open interest in Q1 in our rates business, driven by Eurodollar options and Treasury futures which hit all-time highs. We also had very strong options activity with the highest quarterly volume ever, and the reached a record percentage of the options trading on Globex in March, with 71% electronic in Treasuries, and 25% electronic in Eurodollars. So far in a bill, the electronic percentage of Eurodollar options has grown to 27%. 
On the product development front, we mentioned our launch of the Ultra 10-year contract in our last earnings call. This product has continued to gain momentum, and has attracted attention with several articles written over the last month related to this innovative new products. 
In addition, we are pleased we cleared our first Swaptions trade this month, and we take this as yet another example of innovating and being first to market with a customer-led solution. We held a Swaptions customer webinar that attracted over 500 participants with significant follow-up discussions, and we had a number of productive client events related to the product. Our dollar rate swaps market share reached the highest level in March that we have seen over the last 6 months, and we had a 15% pickup in revenue capture in swaps clearing versus Q4 last year. Lastly, we are actively involved with a working group of intermediaries and customers on a potential repo clearing offering. As that develops over the next quarters, we will share additional information. 
Turning to equities, we are pleased to the start of the year with Q1 volume up 28% and April up more than 30%. We have had solid activity in equity options which grew 20% during the quarter. 
In Q1, our S&P 500 options market share versus CBOE expanded to 29.4% from 27.8% last year. Open interest in equity options rose 13% compared to the prior year, and our new BTIC order type continues to perform overall, and traded 20,000 contracts for the first time on March 31. 
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. These business alliance overall were up 13%. Energy has been particularly strong with record Q1 average daily volume of 2.5 million contracts, and April has continued to be robust with volumes up almost 40%. WTI futures had a record quarter averaging about 1.2 million contracts per day and gasoline futures activity was also at a record level. I mentioned options earlier and within energy, we had record WTI Options volume of over 200,000 contracts per day, and more than 145,000 contracts per day on Globex. 
Our natural gas options were up 38% during the quarter and we had a record percentage of volume traded electronically there.

Financially, agricultural products have been particularly strong in April, and are tracking toward a must the average volume record for the month after a slow start to the -- trading has taken off base in production on uncertainty in South America, where wet conditions in Argentina and dry conditions in Brazil are causing concerns.

2004577,328996757,968564,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you Gill and good morning, everyone everyone per cart the must be intensely focused on 3 things: Driving global the revenue growth, operating our businesses as efficiently as you can and returning excess capital to shoulders in a consistent way. As",1060,"Thank you Gill and good morning, everyone everyone per cart the must be intensely focused on 3 things: Driving global the revenue growth, operating our businesses as efficiently as you can and returning excess capital to shoulders in a consistent way. As Gill mentioned, we had a tremendous start of the year with strong and balanced revenue growth. 
Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter of last year, while total adjusted expense rose just 3%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded to 65%, and adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up 17%. Our rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.756, down 4% from by $0.789 in Q4, as our overall ADV rose 29% sequentially. The biggest impact member versus nonmember mix and volume discounts tiers this quarter due to do large increase in activity. 
Compared to the fourth quarter, our members volume grew 30% and nonmembers jumped 23%. In addition, we had higher volume discounts in Q1 relative to Q4 as a result of significant growth in certain products. 
Market data revenue was up 4.5% compared to Q1 last year and in line with our guidance. We continue to monitor this line carefully as we are seeing some rationalization as we bring all customers in line with the full price offering. And we are seeing some screen declines due to recent bank staff reductions. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter totaled $327 million, up 3% driven primarily by an $8 million increase in licensing and other fee agreements. Excluding license fees, our total expense year-over-year was approximately flat and as a reminder, our annual guidance was 1% increase on that basis. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,600 employees with the majority of the hiring done in India and Belfast, which is part of our plan to reduce the technology expense while improving service by staffing in those lower cost locations and reducing contractors. 
Our compensation ratio for Q1 came in at 14.1%, compared to 16.1% for the full year of 2015. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $26 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries which is up 13% from the prior year. We are pleased with the investment we've made in the index business while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME. 
Now turning to investment income. We had a meaningful increase in investment income, driven almost entirely by the returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guarantee fund contributions. The rise in short-term rates at the end of the year resulted in an increase in investment income of $17 million. 
During Q1, we had returned approximately $10 million of that 2 clearing firms, which is displayed on the income statement under other nonoperating expense. This amount is anticipated to increase as our investment returns grow. We recently received approval to establish an account directly at the Fed. At this point, the account will only be for clearing firm house positions held in cash. We are currently in the process of operationalizing the accounts with the Fed. When effective, we expect to pass a higher rate the clearing members for their in-house positions and then we do today. Cash he;d and segregated customer accounts will continue to be invested through commercial banks and U.S. treasury securities as they are now. 
We expect that he house accounts will be operational in the next month or so. As in the past, we plan to continue to passthrough with the majority of there earnings back to the clearing members. 
Turning to taxes, for the quarter, we ended at 36.3%, slightly below our guidance. And now to the balance sheet. During Q1, we paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends to shoulders, including our variable dividend and the first regular dividend. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. We added $130 million during the quarter driven by do sale-leaseback transaction of our data center with Cyrus 1. 
During the first quarter, capital expenditures, net of a result improvement allowances were $16 million. As we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service which is included in expense. We continue our intense focus on efficiency with the sale of our office buildings over the last few years and more recently, our data center, we are taking an asset-light approach which will allow us to focus on running our core business. 
In 2015, we delayered the management structure, closed futures pits, reduced marketing costs and focused on data center consolidation. So far this year, we have completed the sale of our data center, sublet excess office space in Chicago, announce the closure of our trading stores in New York at year end, and have begun to offshore some positions, reducing compensation and consulting costs. With the sale and leaseback of our data center, we will continue to operate our trading and clearing functions as well as our collocation business, and we will continue to receive the corresponding collocation revenue.  From an earnings perspective, this transition is approximately neutral. 
In terms of expenses, we will see in a net reduction in total quarterly expenses of about $1 million primarily in depreciation, and we expect the corresponding increase under interest expense. 
Turning to the New York floor, we will save approximately $5 million of expense annually beginning in 2017 and possibly, another $3 million per year if we can successfully sublease the space. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. As you know operating leverage in our business is significant, and this was clearly evidenced by the margin on incremental revenue of approximately 90%. We have outlined many positives going forward, including building liquidity around the clock and from around the world, innovating new products, getting access to the Fed accounts which should benefit both our intermediaries and our shoulders, and continuing to focus on our efficiency strategy. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask a limit yourself to 1 question, so we can get to everyone. Please for free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you."

When we look at the expenses, the first quarter tends to be a slower water in terms of expenses as we build up and projects get launched the second and third quarters. But if you look at Slide 14, you could see the results of our focus on expenses. You can see that over time, we've had expanding operating margins and we've got incremental margins last year of 112%, and 90% incremental margins this quarter, and operating margins around 65%. So it's been a large focus of ours. In terms of the guidance, you know we are -- we have guided to a very modest 1% increase in expenses x of license fees. That's we are not adjusting guidance at this time. But we are intensely focused on the business, and the running the business as efficiently as possible.

Within Asia, specifically, we have been focused over the last few years on China but what we have not talked about is the sales effort that Bryan will go a little bit into other parts of Asia, which I would say is more developed in terms of the education side of things. Korea comes to mind. China, we have given you some numbers this quarter specific to China. This are accounts that are based in China but they may be trading. They probably will be trading from outside of China. As China continues to expand its policies for excess, you would see that number grow. The timing behind that remains to be seen. But as we sit here now, China is allowing and has allowed their intermediaries as well as their direct account, such as the hedge funds, the prop and the commercial entities to establish operations outside of China. And that's the flow that we're seeing. India is an untapped opportunity at this time. There are very significant changes of foot in India that will also lend themselves and translate into all opportunities for us.

That's being driven from energy, equities as well as some of our interest rate products. Within the segments, the growth is really coming from props, a growing number of private hedge funds and private managers have always been very working closely with our intermediaries to help bring that business into our markets. We are still some good traction in terms of liberalization of central state-owned enterprises, for example, as always we're permission up until about 2 years ago, at 31, now it's about 112 or in that area so we are seeing that as additional opportunity. Sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are increasingly growing their business because. And again, we are focusing in that area and really building on opportunities to work with corporate, particularly insurance companies. We see more Chinese banks that are inquiring about trading our products and also, looking to build their efforts, inquiring about OTC clearing with us, which is a very good sign. Within Taiwan, year-to-date volume and revenue was up about 40% and 36%, respectively. The main driver is in those areas where equities, FX, energy and interest rates -- the main participants are banks, asset managers. And again, we are still some good opportunities with insurance companies. There's been some progress within Taiwan in terms of allowing securities firms to offer global futures, so we're working very closely with their intermediaries to bring that business into our group. Within Japan, we've seen a consistent growth of about 7%. Revenues are up about 32%. You know you've got to keep in mind, Japan is the second-biggest holder for U.S. debt so there's great opportunities there. Main drivers have been from banks, and we're seeing some nice growth coming from asset managers. Gill alluded to in Korea. We continued to see very nice growth coming out of Korea. Gill was -- 2 years ago, there were no Korea FCMs that had an average monthly volume about 100,000 contracts. Today, we're happy to say that we have 8 firms that are providing at least 100,000 sites per month which is a great progress. And the drivers in that area are equities, rates, foreign currency and energy. Singapore, it's up about 18% coming out of that region. We're seeing some nice growth coming from the banks, in particular as well as proprietary firms and corporates and commercials. Another area that we're very excited about is Australia. We really haven't mentioned that. Our volume this year in Australia is up 12%, and our revenues are up, I think, approximately 50%, if my memory serves me correctly. The top 3 products are interest rates, and some equities. And ag is up about 27%, foreign currencies are up about 39%. Our main focus in working with Australia again is within the asset management community, hedge funds and the banks."

It is an exceptional start to the year with record quarterly average daily volume, which is up 13% compared with an already strong first quarter last year. We had very balanced growth in both financial and commodity products, each up double digits. We track customer segment activity closely, and in Q1, we had more than 10% growth from asset managers hedge funds, corporates, proprietary trading firms and retail clients during the quarter. Volume from banks was up 1%, which is strong relative to the decrease in the overall trading businesses over each of the last few years. More recently, April activity has been fairly strong compared to last year and is up more than 20% in total. It is encouraging to see relatively good volumes as April has been our slowest month over the last 2 years.  Open interest remains elevated and it's up significantly since the beginning of the year. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with the tremendous results from outside of the U.S. during the first quarter. We had record quarterly non-U.S. volume by far as well as the highest proportion of the business from outside of the U.S. since we started tracking the information with more than 25% in the first quarter compared to 23% in the first quarter of last year. 
In Europe, we had a very strong first quarter activity with volume increasing 28% from 2.3 million contracts per day last year to more than 2.9 million per day this year. The increase was led by equities, which jumped 70%, and energy was up almost 60%. 
In Asia, energy was up 75% and equities grew by about 70% with metals rising more than 30%. Focusing on Asia for a moment, we have been discussing the opportunity to expand our user base to include Chinese firms and entities for many years. Our focus started primarily with intermediaries and we are now engaging directly with asset managers, hedge funds and other entities there. We generally look at our trading data in terms of what we see through Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  In Q1, we reached approximately 200,000 contracts per day combined, which is up from 100,000 contracts per day in Q1 of 2014 and 125,000 contracts last year. Our most notable recent success is in our energy franchise where we have seen Mainland China average daily volume increase from less than 10,000 contracts in the middle of last year to more than 30,000 contracts in Q1. 
A highlight from Hong Kong activity is in our equity business with average daily volume there more than doubling to almost 25,000 contracts per day in Q1. The surge in the volume is great to see and we are very fortunate to have highly appealing products to offer these clients. Based on the challenges in China over the last year, we believe many of these firms are comfortable trading in our regulated markets and benefiting from the significant liquidity we have around the clock. 
Speaking of that, in addition to the country of origin information we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q1, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 30% while activity during European hours rose 60%. Liquidity begets liquidity and we are displaying deeper electronic markets in both futures, and more recently, options around the clock. 
Turning to our efforts in options. We remain a strong leader compared to other global exchanges with Q1 options volume hitting a record 3.5 million contracts per day, which is up 22% with electronic options average daily volume rising 26% to a record 1.8 million contracts. The continued electronification of our options franchise has enabled us to further globalize participation in our options markets with our European Options volume up 36% and Asian Options volumes up 25% in Q1. Our continued investment in systems enhancements, new products and client education are driving significantly increased usage of our Options products from end users, with the volumes from hedge funds and asset managers up 34% and up 29%, respectively. 
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with interest rates. Volume rose up 9% to more than 8 million contracts a day and revenue increased by 14% with Eurodollars leading the way. We hit record levels of open interest in Q1 in our rates business, driven by Eurodollar options and Treasury futures, which hit all-time highs. We also had very strong options activity with the highest quarterly volume ever and reached a record percentage of the options trading on Globex in March with 71% electronic in Treasuries, and 25% electronic in Eurodollars. So far in April, the electronic percentage in Eurodollar options has grown to 27%. 
On the product development front. We mentioned our launch of the Ultra 10-year contract in our last earnings call. This product has continued to gain momentum and has attracted attention with several articles written over the last month related to this innovative new product. 
In addition, we are pleased that we cleared our first Swaptions trade earlier this month and we take this as yet another example of innovating and being first to market with a customer-led solution. We held a Swaptions customer webinar that attracted over 500 participants with significant follow-up discussions and we had a number of productive client events related to the product. Our dollar-rate swaps market share reached the highest level in March that we have seen over the last 6 months, and we had a 15% pickup in revenue capture in swaps clearing versus Q4 last year. Lastly, we are actively involved with a working group of intermediaries and customers on a potential repo clearing offering. As that develops over the next quarters, we will share additional information. 
Turning to equities. We are pleased with the start of the year with Q1 volume up 28% and April up more than 30%. We have had solid activity in equity options, which grew 20% during the quarter. 
In Q1, our S&P 500 options market share versus CBOE expanded to 29.4% from 27.8% last year. Open interest in equity options rose 13% compared to the prior year, and our new BTIC order type continues to perform well and traded 20,000 contracts for the first time on March 31. 
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. These business lines overall were up 13%. Energy has been particularly strong with record Q1 average daily volume of 2.5 million contracts and April has continued to be robust with volumes up almost 40%. WTI futures had a record quarter averaging about 1.2 million contracts per day and gasoline futures activity was also at a record level. I mentioned options earlier, and within energy, we had record WTI options volume of over 200,000 contracts per day and more than 145,000 contracts per day on Globex. 
Our natural gas options were up 38% during the quarter and we had a record percentage of volume traded electronically there. Additionally, we set a record number of large open interest holders in our energy futures in Q1. 
Our metals business was also a standout in the first quarter with volumes up 23%.  Our precious metals average daily volume was up 26% led by options, which rose 36% in Q1. 
As many of you know, we have made significant inroads into base and ferrous metals businesses and we continue to expand our presence in these key growth areas. Our copper business is up 11%, and we hit a new open interest record during Q1.  We continue to outperform our primary competitor in this market where we have posted faster growth in copper in each of the last 5 quarters. 
In aluminum, we continue to expand our suite of aluminum offerings, achieving record volumes and increasing our open interest fivefold in the last 12 months.  And in iron ore, leveraging our customer value proposition of global electronic trading of futures and options and customer anonymity, we have had growing open interest and a record trading there of almost 13,000 contracts. We have now achieved iron ore market share of 10% in Q1, up from just 3% in 2015 as we continue to successfully expand and diversify our global suite of metals products. 
Finally, agricultural products have been particularly strong in April and are tracking toward a monthly average daily volume record for the month after a slow start to the year. Trading has taken off based on production uncertainty in South America where wet conditions in Argentina and dry conditions in Brazil are causing concerns. We had 2 consecutive record trading days last week in the overall complex with almost 3 million contracts including record soybean product volume above 1.5 million contracts on one of those days. Electronic ag options are surging up from near 130,000 in April last year to more than 250,000 daily so far this April. Importantly, open interest in soybean and corn futures are up 16% and 8%, respectively, from last year. Finally, last week, we reached an all-time high in large open interest holders in agricultural products. 
In summary. We continue to work with our customers on bringing innovative risk management solutions to the marketplace, and our product diversity is unparalleled. John will touch on our progress to continue to streamline our infrastructure costs, to reallocate our expenses to growth initiatives and to further innovate in our businesses. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,328996757,968688,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on 3 things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way. As Gill ment",1018,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on 3 things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way. As Gill mentioned, we had a tremendous start to the year with strong and balanced revenue growth. 
Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter last year while total adjusted expense rose just 3%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded to 65% and adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up 17%. Our rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.756, down 4% from $0.789 in Q4 as our overall ADV rose 29% sequentially. The biggest impacts were member versus nonmember mix and volume discount tiers this quarter due to do the large increase in activity. Compared to the fourth quarter, our members volume grew 30% and nonmembers jumped 23%. In addition, we had higher volume discounts in Q1 relative to Q4 as a result of significant growth in certain products. 
Market data revenue was up 4.5% compared to Q1 last year and in line with our guidance. We continue to monitor this line carefully as we are seeing some rationalization as we bring all customers in line with the full priced offering. And we are seeing some screen declines due to recent bank staff reductions. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter totaled $327 million, up 3% driven primarily by an $8 million increase in licensing and other fee agreements. Excluding license fees, our total expense year-over-year was approximately flat, and as a reminder, our annual guidance was 1% increase on that basis. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,600 employees with the majority of the hiring done in India and Belfast, which is part of our plan to reduce technology expense while improving service by staffing in those lower-cost locations and reducing contractors. Our compensation ratio for Q1 came in at 14.1% compared to 16.1% for the full year of 2015. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $26 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 13% from the prior year. We are pleased with the investment we made in the index business while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME. 
Now turning to investment income. We had a meaningful increase in investment income, driven almost entirely by the returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guarantee fund contributions. The rise in short-term rates at the end of the year resulted in an increase in investment income of $17 million. 
During Q1, we had returned approximately $10 million of that to clearing firms, which is displayed on the income statement under other nonoperating expense. This amount is anticipated to increase as our investment returns grow. We recently received approval to establish an account directly at the Fed. At this point, the account will only be for clearing firm house positions held in cash. We are currently in the process of operationalizing the accounts with the Fed. When effective, we expect to pass a higher rate to clearing members for their house positions than we do today. Cash held in segregated customer accounts will continue to be invested through commercial banks and U.S. Treasury securities as they are now. We expect that the house accounts will be operational in the next month or so. As in the past, we plan to continue to pass through the majority of the earnings back to the clearing members. 
Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at 36.3%, slightly below our guidance. 
And now to the balance sheet. During Q1, we paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends to shareholders including our variable dividend and the first regular dividend. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. We added $130 million during the quarter driven by the sale-leaseback transaction of our data center with Cyrus One. 
During the first quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, were $16 million as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense. 
We continue our intense focus on efficiency with the sale of our office buildings over the last few years, and more recently, our data center. We are taking an asset-light approach, which will allow us to focus on running our core business. In 2015, we delayered the management structure, closed futures pits, reduced marketing costs and focused on data center consolidation. So far this year, we have completed the sale of our data center, sublet excess office space in Chicago, announced the closure of our trading floors in New York at year-end and have begun to offshore some positions reducing compensation and consulting costs. 
With the sale and leaseback of our data center, we will continue to operate our trading and clearing functions as well as our colocation business and we will continue to receive the corresponding colocation revenue. From an earnings perspective, this transaction is approximately neutral. 
In terms of expenses, we will see in a net reduction in total quarterly expenses of about $1 million, primarily in depreciation, and we expect a corresponding increase under interest expense. 
Turning to the New York floor. We will save approximately $5 million of expense annually beginning in 2017 and possibly another $3 million per year if we can successfully sublease the space. 
In summary. I'm very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. As you know operating leverage in our business is significant and this was clearly evidenced by the margin on incremental revenue of approximately 90%. We have outlined many positives going forward including building liquidity around the clock and from around the world; innovating new products; getting access to the Fed accounts, which should benefit both our intermediaries and our shareholders; and continuing to focus on our efficiency strategy. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

When we look at the expenses, the first quarter tends to be a slower quarter in terms of expenses as we build up and projects get launched in the second and third quarters. But if you look at Slide 14, you could see the results of our focus on expenses. You can see that, over time, we've had expanding operating margins and we've got incremental margins last year of 112% and 90% incremental margins this quarter and operating margins around 65%. So it's been a large focus of ours. In terms of the guidance, you know we are -- we have guided to a very modest 1% increase in expenses ex of license fees. That's -- we're not adjusting guidance at this time. But we are intensely focused on the business and running the business as efficiently as possible. And what this does is this allows us to free up costs for growth initiatives and some of the growth initiatives Gill outlined in his prepared remarks.

In fact, if you take a look, since 2012, in the first quarter of 2012, we actually had an $18 million expense in nonoperating income and now we've driven that to a $5 million income on that line. So overall, when you look at how -- the earnings that we got for managing collateral, we earned approximately $7 million this quarter through investing that collateral, which is about double last quarter. It was driven primarily by the increase in interest rates. Access to the Fed accounts will be for house positions held in cash. So to the extent that, that cash balance increases, there's an opportunity for us to earn more. And we'll be able to provide more color on how much is -- about that impact next quarter when the Fed accounts become operational. But to give you an idea, about 20% of our $138 billion in collateral is house account-related. Maybe Kim could comment on the Fed account."

I would say we're absolutely pleased, but not fully satisfied with the growth that we continue to impact here on the energies business. I mean, we have -- not only have we grown to record levels into Q1, we've increased our large open interest orders and it's been pretty strong growth. We've talked last quarter about the benefits of the overall broad market adoption increasingly towards WTI with the result of the lifting of the export ban in the U.S. That's actually significantly increased participation in our markets on the futures as well as the options side. But in terms of where we're going outside of that options has been a significant area of growth for us inside the energies business and I would actually also direct you to some of the comments that Gill made in his prepared remarks around where and how we are globalizing our footprint right now. If you look at where the growth of our business is coming from, in our EMEA business for agri -- for energy business up over 40%, that's outperforming the business as a whole. What's really exciting is the investments that we have made in boots on the ground, sales campaigns and product sales in Asia for us is bearing significant fruit. Our Asian energy business is up 82% year-on-year and that is significant growth in almost every major trading center. I was in Shanghai and Singapore last week meeting with a lot of clients and we continue to be able to attract them with our functionality, both in the futures as well as the options side and the broad based of participation in our market. So we tell a lot of the WTI story, there's a nat gas story, there's a gasoline story. We set an all-time record in our gasoline futures as well. So it's broad-based growth, it's global growth and it's across our asset class in the presence of building OI and large open interest holders."

Korea comes to mind. China, we have given you some numbers this quarter specific to China. These are accounts that are based in China, but they might be trading -- they probably will be trading from outside of China. As China continues to expand its policies for access, you would see that number grow. The timing behind that remains to be seen. But as we sit here now, China is allowing and has allowed their intermediaries as well as their direct accounts such as the hedge funds, the props shops and the commercial entities to establish operations outside of China and that's the flow that we're seeing. India is an untapped opportunity at this time. There are very significant changes afoot in India that will also lend themselves and translate into opportunities for us.

Within the segments, the growth is really coming from props, a growing number of private hedge funds and asset managers have also evolved. We're working closely with our intermediaries to help bring that business into our markets. We're seeing some good traction in terms of liberalization of central state-owned enterprises, for example, SOEs. We're permission up until about 2 years ago at 31, now it's about 112 or in that area so we're seeing that as additional opportunity. Sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are increasingly growing their business with us, and again, we're focusing in that area and really building on opportunities to work with corporates, particularly insurance companies. We see more Chinese banks that are inquiring about trading our products and also looking to build their efforts, enquiring about OTC clearing with us, which is a very good sign. Within Taiwan, year-to-date volume and revenue was up about 40% and 36%, respectively. The main drivers in those areas were equities, FX, energy and interest rates. The main participants are banks, asset managers, and again, we're seeing some good opportunities with insurance companies. There's been some progress within Taiwan in terms of allowing securities firms to offer global futures, so we're working very closely with their intermediaries to bring that business into our group. Within Japan, we've seen a consistent growth of about 7%. Revenues are up about 32%. You know you've got to keep in mind, Japan is the second-biggest holder of U.S. debt, so there's great opportunities there. Main drivers have been from banks and we're seeing some nice growth coming from asset managers. Gill alluded to Korea, we continue to see very nice growth coming out of Korea. Two years ago, there were no Korea FCMs that had an average monthly volume about 100,000 contracts. Today, we're happy to say that we have 8 firms that are providing at least 100,000 sites per month, which is a great progress. And the drivers in that area are equities, rates, foreign currency and energy. Singapore, it's up about 18% coming out of that region. We're seeing some nice growth coming from the banks, in particular, as well as proprietary firms and corporates and commercials. Another area that we're very excited about is Australia, we really haven't mentioned that. Our volume this year in Australia is up 12% and our revenues are up, I think, approximately 50% if my memory serves me correctly. The top 3 products are interest rates, ags, equities and ags are up about 27%, foreign currencies are up about 39%.

So developing products in-house that our customers can use on a more capital-efficient basis is one of the things that we have been doing and we'll continue to actually do. If you look at the compression services that we implemented not too long ago, up to this point in time, we have had $21 trillion in notional value that have been compressed over time. And if you look at the performance of the OTC market itself, it has taken an uptick from the fourth quarter of last year. Now this value proposition, this group of value proposition that I just described, no one else can provide that, the compression in conjunction with the cross-margining and in conjunction with the futurization opportunity. So I think from that perspective, we are quite excited as the interest rate environment continues to shift."

So while we may not have talked about this as actively before, this is certainly something that we look at very closely. In particular, if you look at that business, we're very focused on the ability, right, to cross-margin obviously the underlying futures against the options. As the most efficient platform possible, we're continuously focused on TCA or total cost analysis. We've talked about this across each our different business lines. If you recall, the beginning of last year, Greenwich Associates did a big study that looked at our interest rate futures as always being the lowest cost relative to the interest rate swaps industry in terms of representing risk. Similarly, we have come out last year with something called The Big Picture and then we did an update this year, again, with The Big Picture. But we're showing that our, as an example, our equity future's far more efficient for investors for getting exposure to the equity market than the ETFs.

It is an exceptional start to the year with record quarterly average daily volume, which is up 13% compared with an already strong first quarter last year. We had very balanced growth in both financial and commodity products, each up double digits. We track customer segment activity closely, and in Q1, we had more than 10% growth from asset managers hedge funds, corporates, proprietary trading firms and retail clients during the quarter. Volume from banks was up 1%, which is strong relative to the decrease in the overall trading businesses over each of the last few years. More recently, April activity has been fairly strong compared to last year and is up more than 20% in total. It is encouraging to see relatively good volumes as April has been our slowest month over the last 2 years.  Open interest remains elevated and it's up significantly since the beginning of the year. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with the tremendous results from outside of the U.S. during the first quarter. We had record quarterly non-U.S. volume by far as well as the highest proportion of the business from outside of the U.S. since we started tracking the information with more than 25% in the first quarter compared to 23% in the first quarter of last year. 
In Europe, we had a very strong first quarter activity with volume increasing 28% from 2.3 million contracts per day last year to more than 2.9 million per day this year. The increase was led by equities, which jumped 70%, and energy was up almost 60%. 
In Asia, energy was up 75% and equities grew by about 70% with metals rising more than 30%. Focusing on Asia for a moment, we have been discussing the opportunity to expand our user base to include Chinese firms and entities for many years. Our focus started primarily with intermediaries and we are now engaging directly with asset managers, hedge funds and other entities there. We generally look at our trading data in terms of what we see through Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  In Q1, we reached approximately 200,000 contracts per day combined, which is up from 100,000 contracts per day in Q1 of 2014 and 125,000 contracts last year. Our most notable recent success is in our energy franchise where we have seen Mainland China average daily volume increase from less than 10,000 contracts in the middle of last year to more than 30,000 contracts in Q1. 
A highlight from Hong Kong activity is in our equity business with average daily volume there more than doubling to almost 25,000 contracts per day in Q1. The surge in the volume is great to see and we are very fortunate to have highly appealing products to offer these clients. Based on the challenges in China over the last year, we believe many of these firms are comfortable trading in our regulated markets and benefiting from the significant liquidity we have around the clock. 
Speaking of that, in addition to the country of origin information we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q1, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 30% while activity during European hours rose 60%. Liquidity begets liquidity and we are displaying deeper electronic markets in both futures, and more recently, options around the clock. 
Turning to our efforts in options. We remain a strong leader compared to other global exchanges with Q1 options volume hitting a record 3.5 million contracts per day, which is up 22% with electronic options average daily volume rising 26% to a record 1.8 million contracts. The continued electronification of our options franchise has enabled us to further globalize participation in our options markets with our European Options volume up 36% and Asian Options volumes up 25% in Q1. Our continued investment in systems enhancements, new products and client education are driving significantly increased usage of our Options products from end users, with the volumes from hedge funds and asset managers up 34% and up 29%, respectively. 
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with interest rates. Volume rose up 9% to more than 8 million contracts a day and revenue increased by 14% with Eurodollars leading the way. We hit record levels of open interest in Q1 in our rates business, driven by Eurodollar options and Treasury futures, which hit all-time highs. We also had very strong options activity with the highest quarterly volume ever and reached a record percentage of the options trading on Globex in March with 71% electronic in Treasuries, and 25% electronic in Eurodollars. So far in April, the electronic percentage in Eurodollar options has grown to 27%. 
On the product development front. We mentioned our launch of the Ultra 10-year contract in our last earnings call. This product has continued to gain momentum and has attracted attention with several articles written over the last month related to this innovative new product. 
In addition, we are pleased that we cleared our first Swaptions trade earlier this month and we take this as yet another example of innovating and being first to market with a customer-led solution. We held a Swaptions customer webinar that attracted over 500 participants with significant follow-up discussions and we had a number of productive client events related to the product. Our dollar-rate swaps market share reached the highest level in March that we have seen over the last 6 months, and we had a 15% pickup in revenue capture in swaps clearing versus Q4 last year. Lastly, we are actively involved with a working group of intermediaries and customers on a potential repo clearing offering. As that develops over the next quarters, we will share additional information. 
Turning to equities. We are pleased with the start of the year with Q1 volume up 28% and April up more than 30%. We have had solid activity in equity options, which grew 20% during the quarter. 
In Q1, our S&P 500 options market share versus CBOE expanded to 29.4% from 27.8% last year. Open interest in equity options rose 13% compared to the prior year, and our new BTIC order type continues to perform well and traded 20,000 contracts for the first time on March 31. 
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. These business lines overall were up 13%. Energy has been particularly strong with record Q1 average daily volume of 2.5 million contracts and April has continued to be robust with volumes up almost 40%. WTI futures had a record quarter averaging about 1.2 million contracts per day and gasoline futures activity was also at a record level. I mentioned options earlier, and within energy, we had record WTI options volume of over 200,000 contracts per day and more than 145,000 contracts per day on Globex. 
Our natural gas options were up 38% during the quarter and we had a record percentage of volume traded electronically there. Additionally, we set a record number of large open interest holders in our energy futures in Q1. 
Our metals business was also a standout in the first quarter with volumes up 23%.  Our precious metals average daily volume was up 26% led by options, which rose 36% in Q1. 
As many of you know, we have made significant inroads into base and ferrous metals businesses and we continue to expand our presence in these key growth areas. Our copper business is up 11%, and we hit a new open interest record during Q1.  We continue to outperform our primary competitor in this market where we have posted faster growth in copper in each of the last 5 quarters. 
In aluminum, we continue to expand our suite of aluminum offerings, achieving record volumes and increasing our open interest fivefold in the last 12 months.  And in iron ore, leveraging our customer value proposition of global electronic trading of futures and options and customer anonymity, we have had growing open interest and a record trading day of almost 13,000 contracts. We have now achieved iron ore market share of 10% in Q1, up from just 3% in 2015 as we continue to successfully expand and diversify our global suite of metals products. 
Finally, agricultural products have been particularly strong in April and are tracking toward a monthly average daily volume record for the month after a slow start to the year. Trading has taken off based on production uncertainty in South America where wet conditions in Argentina and dry conditions in Brazil are causing concerns. We had 2 consecutive record trading days last week in the overall complex with almost 3 million contracts including record soybean product volume above 1.5 million contracts on one of those days. Electronic ag options are surging up from near 130,000 in April last year to more than 250,000 daily so far this April. Importantly, open interest in soybean and corn futures are up 16% and 8%, respectively, from last year. Finally, last week, we reached an all-time high in large open interest holders in agricultural products. 
In summary. We continue to work with our customers on bringing innovative risk management solutions to the marketplace, and our product diversity is unparalleled. John will touch on our progress to continue to streamline our infrastructure costs, to reallocate our expenses to growth initiatives and to further innovate in our businesses. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,328996757,968866,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on 3 things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way. As Gill ment",1019,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on 3 things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way. As Gill mentioned, we had a tremendous start to the year with strong and balanced revenue growth. 
Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter last year while total adjusted expense rose just 3%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded to 65% and adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up 17%. Our rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.756, down 4% from $0.789 in Q4 as our overall ADV rose 29% sequentially. The biggest impacts were member versus nonmember mix and volume discount tiers this quarter due to do the large increase in activity. Compared to the fourth quarter, our members volume grew 30% and nonmembers jumped 23%. In addition, we had higher volume discounts in Q1 relative to Q4 as a result of significant growth in certain products. 
Market data revenue was up 4.5% compared to Q1 last year and in line with our guidance. We continue to monitor this line carefully as we are seeing some rationalization as we bring all customers in line with the full priced offering. And we are seeing some screen declines due to recent bank staff reductions. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter totaled $327 million, up 3% driven primarily by an $8 million increase in licensing and other fee agreements. Excluding license fees, our total expense year-over-year was approximately flat, and as a reminder, our annual guidance was 1% increase on a net basis. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,600 employees with the majority of the hiring done in India and Belfast, which is part of our plan to reduce technology expense while improving service by staffing in those lower-cost locations and reducing contractors. Our compensation ratio for Q1 came in at 14.1% compared to 16.1% for the full year of 2015. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $26 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 13% from the prior year. We are pleased with the investment we made in the index business while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME. 
Now turning to investment income. We had a meaningful increase in investment income, driven almost entirely by the returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guarantee fund contributions. The rise in short-term rates at the end of the year resulted in an increase in investment income of $17 million. 
During Q1, we had returned approximately $10 million of that to clearing firms, which is displayed on the income statement under other nonoperating expense. This amount is anticipated to increase as our investment returns grow. We recently received approval to establish an account directly at the Fed. At this point, the account will only be for clearing firm house positions held in cash. We are currently in the process of operationalizing the accounts with the Fed. When effective, we expect to pass a higher rate to clearing members for their house positions than we do today. Cash held in segregated customer accounts will continue to be invested through commercial banks and U.S. Treasury securities as they are now. We expect that the house accounts will be operational in the next month or so. As in the past, we plan to continue to pass through the majority of the earnings back to the clearing members. 
Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at 36.3%, slightly below our guidance. 
And now to the balance sheet. During Q1, we paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends to shareholders including our variable dividend and the first regular dividend. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. We added $130 million during the quarter driven by the sale-leaseback transaction of our data center with Cyrus One. 
During the first quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, were $16 million as we continued to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense. 
We continue our intense focus on efficiency with the sale of our office buildings over the last few years, and more recently, our data center. We are taking an asset-light approach, which will allow us to focus on running our core business. In 2015, we delayered the management structure, closed futures pits, reduced marketing costs and focused on data center consolidation. So far this year, we have completed the sale of our data center, sublet excess office space in Chicago, announced the closure of our trading floors in New York at year-end and have begun to offshore some positions reducing compensation and consulting costs. 
With the sale and leaseback of our data center, we will continue to operate our trading and clearing functions as well as our colocation business and we will continue to receive the corresponding colocation revenue. From an earnings perspective, this transaction is approximately neutral. 
In terms of expenses, we will see in a net reduction in total quarterly expense of about $1 million, primarily in depreciation, and we expect a corresponding increase under interest expense. 
Turning to the New York floor. We will save approximately $5 million of expense annually beginning in 2017 and possibly another $3 million per year if we can successfully sublease the space. 
In summary. I'm very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. As you know operating leverage in our business is significant and this was clearly evidenced by the margin on incremental revenue of approximately 90%. We have outlined many positives going forward including building liquidity around the clock and from around the world; innovating new products; getting access to the Fed accounts, which should benefit both our intermediaries and our shareholders; and continuing to focus on our efficiency strategy.

When we look at the expenses, the first quarter tends to be a slower quarter in terms of expenses as we build up and projects get launched in the second and third quarters. But if you look at Slide 14, you could see the results of our focus on expenses. You can see that, over time, we've had expanding operating margins and we've got incremental margins last year of 112% and 90% incremental margins this quarter and operating margins around 65%. So it's been a large focus of ours. In terms of the guidance, you know we are -- we have guided to a very modest 1% increase in expenses ex of license fees. That's -- we're not adjusting guidance at this time. But we are intensely focused on the business and running the business as efficiently as possible.

We've talked last quarter about the benefits of the overall broad market adoption increasingly towards WTI with the result of the lifting of the export ban in the U.S. That's actually significantly increased participation in our markets on the futures as well as the options side. But in terms of where we're going outside of that, options has been a significant area of growth for us inside the energies business and I would actually also direct you to some of the comments that Gill made in his prepared remarks around where and how we are globalizing our footprint right now. If you look at where the growth of our business is coming from, in our EMEA business for agri -- for energy business up over 40%, that's outperforming the business as a whole. What's really exciting is the investments that we have made in boots on the ground, sales campaigns and product sales in Asia for us is bearing significant fruit. Our Asian energy business is up 82% year-on-year and that is significant growth in almost every major trading center. I was in Shanghai and Singapore last week meeting with a lot of clients and we continue to be able to attract them with our functionality, both in the futures as well as the options side and the broad based of participation in our market. So we tell a lot of the WTI story, there's a nat gas story, there's a gasoline story. We set an all-time record in our gasoline futures as well.

Korea comes to mind. China, we have given you some numbers this quarter specific to China. These are accounts that are based in China, but they might be trading -- they probably will be trading from outside of China. As China continues to expand its policies for access, you would see that number grow. The timing behind that remains to be seen. But as we sit here now, China is allowing and has allowed their intermediaries as well as their direct accounts such as the hedge funds, the prop shops and the commercial entities to establish operations outside of China and that's the flow that we're seeing. India is an untapped opportunity at this time. There are very significant changes afoot in India that will also lend themselves and translate into opportunities for us.

Within the segments, the growth is really coming from props, a growing number of private hedge funds and asset managers have also evolved.

We're seeing some good traction in terms of liberalization of central state-owned enterprises, for example, SOEs. We're permission up until about 2 years ago at 31, now it's about 112 or in that area so we're seeing that as additional opportunity. Sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are increasingly growing their business with us, and again, we're focusing in that area and really building on opportunities to work with corporates, particularly insurance companies. We see more Chinese banks that are inquiring about trading our products and also looking to build their efforts, enquiring about OTC clearing with us, which is a very good sign. Within Taiwan, year-to-date volume and revenue was up about 40% and 36%, respectively. The main drivers in those areas were equities, FX, energy and interest rates. The main participants are banks, asset managers, and again, we're seeing some good opportunities with insurance companies. There's been some progress within Taiwan in terms of allowing securities firms to offer global futures, so we're working very closely with our intermediaries to bring that business into our group. Within Japan, we've seen a consistent growth of about 7%. Revenues are up about 32%. You know you've got to keep in mind, Japan is the second-biggest holder of U.S. debt, so there's great opportunities there. Main drivers have been from banks and we're seeing some nice growth coming from asset managers. Gill alluded to Korea, we continue to see very nice growth coming out of Korea. Two years ago, there were no Korea FCMs that had an average monthly volume about 100,000 contracts. Today, we're happy to say that we have 8 firms that are providing at least 100,000 sites per month, which is a great progress. And the drivers in that area are equities, rates, foreign currency and energy. Singapore, it's up about 18% coming out of that region. We're seeing some nice growth coming from the banks, in particular, as well as proprietary firms and corporates and commercials. Another area that we're very excited about is Australia, we really haven't mentioned that. Our volume this year in Australia is up 12% and our revenues are up, I think, approximately 50% if my memory serves me correctly.

So I think, for us, we do have natural increases to our costs, and over time, the inflationary things, salaries and wages and the like. But we are -- we provide a tremendous amount of value to our clients, and so as more liquidity comes into the marketplace, there's more training trading that occurs, which is a tremendous benefit to our business. And the amount of volume that we're able to handle, we've been proven out to be able to handle that. Other things that kind of impact the margin is also the license fees we pay on equity contracts primarily, so there is some share that impacts kind of our margin level.

As the most efficient platform possible, we're continuously focused on TCA or total cost analysis. We've talked about this across each our different business lines. If you recall, the beginning of last year, Greenwich Associates did a big study that looked at our interest rate futures as always being the lowest cost relative to the interest rate swaps industry in terms of representing risk. Similarly, we have come out last year with something called The Big Picture and then we did an update this year, again, with The Big Picture. But we're showing that our, as an example, our equity future's far more efficient for investors for getting exposure to the equity market than the ETFs.

It is an exceptional start to the year with record quarterly average daily volume, which is up 13% compared with an already strong first quarter last year. We had very balanced growth in both financial and commodity products, each up double digits. We track customer segment activity closely, and in Q1, we had more than 10% growth from asset managers, hedge funds, corporates, proprietary trading firms and retail clients during the quarter. Volume from banks was up 1%, which is strong relative to the decrease in the overall trading businesses over each of the last few years. More recently, April activity has been fairly strong compared to last year and is up more than 20% in total. It is encouraging to see relatively good volumes as April has been our slowest month over the last 2 years. Open interest remains elevated and it's up significantly since the beginning of the year.
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with the tremendous results from outside of the U.S. during the first quarter. We had record quarterly non-U.S. volume by far as well as the highest proportion of the business from outside of the U.S. since we started tracking the information with more than 25% in the first quarter compared to 23% in the first quarter of last year.
In Europe, we had a very strong first quarter activity with volume increasing 28% from 2.3 million contracts per day last year to more than 2.9 million per day this year. The increase was led by equities, which jumped 70%, and energy was up almost 60%.
In Asia, energy was up 75% and equities grew by about 70% with metals rising more than 30%. Focusing on Asia for a moment, we have been discussing the opportunity to expand our user base to include Chinese firms and entities for many years. Our focus started primarily with intermediaries and we are now engaging directly with asset managers, hedge funds and other entities there. We generally look at our trading data in terms of what we see through Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In Q1, we reached approximately 200,000 contracts per day combined, which is up from 100,000 contracts per day in Q1 of 2014 and 125,000 contracts last year. Our most notable recent success is in our energy franchise where we have seen Mainland China average daily volume increase from less than 10,000 contracts in the middle of last year to more than 30,000 contracts in Q1.
A highlight from Hong Kong activity is in our equity business with average daily volume there more than doubling to almost 25,000 contracts per day in Q1. The surge in volume is great to see and we are very fortunate to have highly appealing products to offer these clients. Based on the challenges in China over the last year, we believe many of these firms are comfortable trading in our regulated markets and benefiting from the significant liquidity we have around the clock.
Speaking of that, in addition to the country of origin information we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q1, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 30% while activity during European hours rose 60%. Liquidity begets liquidity and we are displaying deeper electronic markets in both futures, and more recently, options around the clock.
Turning to our efforts in options. We remain a strong leader compared to other global exchanges with Q1 options volume hitting a record 3.5 million contracts per day, which is up 22% with electronic options average daily volume rising 26% to a record 1.8 million contracts. The continued electronification of our options franchise has enabled us to further globalize participation in our options markets with our European Options volume up 36% and Asian Options volumes up 25% in Q1. Our continued investment in systems enhancements, new products and client education are driving significantly increased usage of our Options products from end users, with volumes from hedge funds and asset managers up 34% and up 29%, respectively.
A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with interest rates. Volume rose 9% to more than 8 million contracts a day and revenue increased by 14% with Eurodollars leading the way. We hit record levels of open interest in Q1 in our rates business, driven by Eurodollar options and Treasury futures, which hit all-time highs. We also had very strong options activity with the highest quarterly volume ever and reached a record percentage of the options trading on Globex in March with 71% electronic in Treasuries, and 25% electronic in Eurodollars. So far in April, the electronic percentage in Eurodollar options has grown to 27%.
On the product development front. We mentioned our launch of the Ultra 10-year contract in our last earnings call. This product has continued to gain momentum and has attracted attention with several articles written over the last month related to this innovative new product.
In addition, we are pleased that we cleared our first Swaptions trade earlier this month and we think this is yet another example of innovating and being first to market with a customer-led solution. We held a Swaptions customer webinar that attracted over 500 participants with significant follow-up discussions and we had a number of productive client events related to the product. Our dollar-rate swaps market share reached the highest level in March that we have seen over the last 6 months, and we had a 15% pickup in revenue capture in swaps clearing versus Q4 last year. Lastly, we are actively involved with a working group of intermediaries and customers on a potential repo clearing offering. As that develops over the next quarters, we will share additional information.
Turning to equities. We are pleased with the start of the year with Q1 volume up 28% and April up more than 30%. We have had solid activity in equity options, which grew 20% during the quarter.
In Q1, our S&P 500 options market share versus CBOE expanded to 29.4% from 27.8% last year. Open interest in equity options rose 13% compared to the prior year, and our new BTIC order type continues to perform well and traded 20,000 contracts for the first time on March 31.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. These business lines overall were up 13%. Energy has been particularly strong with record Q1 average daily volume of 2.5 million contracts and April has continued to be robust with volumes up almost 40%. WTI futures had a record quarter averaging about 1.2 million contracts per day and gasoline futures activity was also at a record level. I mentioned options earlier, and within energy, we had record WTI options volume of over 200,000 contracts per day and more than 145,000 contracts per day on Globex.
Our natural gas options were up 38% during the quarter and we had a record percentage of volume traded electronically there. Additionally, we set a record number of large open interest holders in our energy futures in Q1.
Our metals business was also a standout in the first quarter with volumes up 23%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 26% led by options, which rose 36% in Q1.
As many of you know, we have made significant inroads into base and ferrous metals businesses and we continue to expand our presence in these key growth areas. Our copper business is up 11%, and we hit a new open interest record during Q1. We continue to outperform our primary competitor in this market where we have posted faster growth in copper in each of the last 5 quarters.
In aluminum, we continue to expand our suite of aluminum offerings, achieving record volumes and increasing our open interest fivefold in the last 12 months. And in iron ore, leveraging our customer value proposition of global electronic trading of futures and options and customer anonymity, we have had growing open interest and a record trading day of almost 13,000 contracts. We have now achieved iron ore market share of 10% in Q1, up from just 3% in 2015 as we continue to successfully expand and diversify our global suite of metals products.
Finally, agricultural products have been particularly strong in April and are tracking toward a monthly average daily volume record for the month after a slow start to the year. Trading has taken off based on production uncertainty in South America where wet conditions in Argentina and dry conditions in Brazil are causing concerns. We had 2 consecutive record trading days last week in the overall complex with almost 3 million contracts including record soybean product volume above 1.5 million contracts on one of those days. Electronic ag options are surging up from near 130,000 in April last year to more than 250,000 daily so far this April. Importantly, open interest in soybean and corn futures are up 16% and 8%, respectively, from last year. Finally, last week, we reached an all-time high in large open interest holders in agricultural products.
In summary. We continue to work with our customers on bringing innovative risk management solutions to the marketplace, and our product diversity is unparalleled. John will touch on our progress to continue to streamline our infrastructure costs, to reallocate our expenses to growth initiatives and to further innovate in our businesses.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,328996757,1007316,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on 3 things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way. As Gill ment",1018,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on 3 things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way. As Gill mentioned, we had a tremendous start to the year with strong and balanced revenue growth.
Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter last year while total adjusted expense rose just 3%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded to 65% and adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up 17%. Our rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.756, down 4% from $0.789 in Q4 as our overall ADV rose 29% sequentially. The biggest impacts were member versus nonmember mix and volume discount tiers this quarter due to the large increase in activity. Compared to the fourth quarter, our members volume grew 30% and nonmembers jumped 23%. In addition, we had higher volume discounts in Q1 relative to Q4 as a result of significant growth in certain products.
Market data revenue was up 4.5% compared to Q1 last year and in line with our guidance. We continue to monitor this line carefully as we are seeing some rationalization as we bring all customers in line with the full priced offering. And we are seeing some screen declines due to recent bank staff reductions.
Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter totaled $327 million, up 3% driven primarily by an $8 million increase in licensing and other fee agreements. Excluding license fees, our total expense year-over-year was approximately flat, and as a reminder, our annual guidance was a 1% increase on a net basis.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,600 employees with the majority of the hiring done in India and Belfast, which is part of our plan to reduce technology expense while improving service by staffing in those lower-cost locations and reducing contractors. Our compensation ratio for Q1 came in at 14.1% compared to 16.1% for the full year of 2015.
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $26 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 13% from the prior year. We are pleased with the investment we made in the index business while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.
Now turning to investment income. We had a meaningful increase in investment income, driven almost entirely by the returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guarantee fund contributions. The rise in short-term rates at the end of the year resulted in an increase in investment income of $17 million.
During Q1, we had returned approximately $10 million of that to clearing firms, which is displayed on the income statement under other nonoperating expense. This amount is anticipated to increase as our investment returns grow. We recently received approval to establish an account directly at the Fed. At this point, the account will only be for clearing firm house positions held in cash. We are currently in the process of operationalizing the accounts with the Fed. When effective, we expect to pass a higher rate to clearing members for their house positions than we do today. Cash held in segregated customer accounts will continue to be invested through commercial banks and U.S. Treasury securities as they are now. We expect that the house accounts will be operational in the next month or so. As in the past, we plan to continue to pass through the majority of the earnings back to the clearing members.
Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at 36.3%, slightly below our guidance.
And now to the balance sheet. During Q1, we paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends to shareholders including our variable dividend and the first regular dividend. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. We added $130 million during the quarter driven by the sale-leaseback transaction of our data center with Cyrus One.
During the first quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, were $16 million as we continued to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense.
We continue our intense focus on efficiency with the sale of our office buildings over the last few years, and more recently, our data center. We are taking an asset-light approach, which will allow us to focus on running our core business. In 2015, we delayered the management structure, closed futures pits, reduced marketing costs and focused on data center consolidation. So far this year, we have completed the sale of our data center, sublet excess office space in Chicago, announced the closure of our trading floors in New York at year-end and have begun to offshore some positions reducing compensation and consulting costs.
With the sale and leaseback of our data center, we will continue to operate our trading and clearing functions as well as our colocation business and we will continue to receive the corresponding colocation revenue. From an earnings perspective, this transaction is approximately neutral.
In terms of expenses, we will see a net reduction in total quarterly expense of about $1 million, primarily in depreciation, and we expect a corresponding increase under interest expense.
Turning to the New York floor. We will save approximately $5 million of expense annually beginning in 2017 and possibly another $3 million per year if we can successfully sublease the space.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. As you know operating leverage in our business is significant and this was clearly evidenced by the margin on incremental revenue of approximately 90%. We have outlined many positives going forward including building liquidity around the clock and from around the world; innovating new products; getting access to the Fed accounts, which should benefit both our intermediaries and our shareholders; and continuing to focus on our efficiency strategy.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

Expense control and running our business as efficiently as possible is a very big focus of the entire management team and it's really become part of our DNA. When we look at the expenses, the first quarter tends to be a slower quarter in terms of expenses as we build up and projects get launched in the second and third quarters. But if you look at Slide 14, you could see the results of our focus on expenses. You can see that, over time, we've had expanding operating margins and we've got incremental margins last year of 112% and 90% incremental margins this quarter and operating margins around 65%. So it's been a large focus of ours. In terms of the guidance, you know we are -- we have guided to a very modest 1% increase in expenses ex of license fees. That's -- we're not adjusting guidance at this time. But we are intensely focused on the business and running the business as efficiently as possible. And what this does is this allows us to free up costs for growth initiatives and some of the growth initiatives Gill outlined in his prepared remarks.

But in terms of where we're going outside of that, options has been a significant area of growth for us inside the energies business and I would actually also direct you to some of the comments that Gill made in his prepared remarks around where and how we are globalizing our footprint right now. If you look at where the growth of our business is coming from, in our EMEA business for agri -- for energy business up about 40%, that's outperforming the business as a whole. What's really exciting is the investments that we have made in boots on the ground, sales campaigns and product sales in Asia for us is bearing significant fruit. Our Asian energy business is up 82% year-on-year and that is significant growth in almost every major trading center. I was in Shanghai and Singapore last week meeting with a lot of our clients and we continue to be able to attract them with our functionality, both in the futures as well as the options side and the broad based of participation in our market.

Within Asia, specifically, we have been focused over the last few years on China, but what we have not talked about is the sales effort that Bryan will go a little bit into, into other parts of Asia, which I would say are more developed in terms of the education side of things. Korea comes to mind. China, we have given you some numbers this quarter specific to China. These are accounts that are based in China, but they might be trading -- they probably will be trading from outside of China. As China continues to expand its policies for access, you would see that number grow. The timing behind that remains to be seen. But as we sit here now, China is allowing and has allowed their intermediaries as well as their direct accounts such as the hedge funds, the prop shops and the commercial entities to establish operations outside of China and that's the flow that we're seeing. India is an untapped opportunity at this time. There are very significant changes afoot in India that will also lend themselves and translate into opportunities for us.

That's being driven from energy, equities as well as some of our interest rate products. Within the segments, the growth is really coming from props, a growing number of private hedge funds and asset managers have also evolved. We're working very closely with our intermediaries to help bring that business into our markets. We're seeing some good traction in terms of liberalization of central state-owned enterprises, for example, SOEs. We're permissioned up until about 2 years ago at 31, now it's about 112 or in that area so we're seeing that as additional opportunity. Sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are increasingly growing their business with us, and again, we're focusing in that area and really building on opportunities to work with corporates, particularly insurance companies. We see more Chinese banks that are inquiring about trading our products and also looking to build their efforts, enquiring about OTC clearing with us, which is a very good sign. Within Taiwan, year-to-date volume and revenue was up about 40% and 36%, respectively. The main drivers in those areas were equities, FX, energy and interest rates. The main participants are banks, asset managers, and again, we're seeing some good opportunities with insurance companies. There's been some progress within Taiwan in terms of allowing securities firms to offer global futures, so we're working very closely with our intermediaries to bring that business into our group. Within Japan, we've seen a consistent growth of about 7%. Revenues are up about 32%. You know you've got to keep in mind, Japan is the second-biggest holder of U.S. debt, so there's great opportunities there. Main drivers have been from banks and we're seeing some nice growth coming from asset managers. Gill alluded to Korea, we continue to see very nice growth coming out of Korea. Two years ago, there were no Korean FCMs that had an average monthly volume about 100,000 contracts. Today, we're happy to say that we have 8 firms that are providing at least 100,000 sites per month, which is a great progress. And the drivers in that area are equities, rates, foreign currency and energy. Singapore, it's up about 18% coming out of that region. We're seeing some nice growth coming from the banks, in particular, as well as proprietary firms and corporates and commercials. Another area that we're very excited about is Australia, we really haven't mentioned that. Our volume this year in Australia is up 12% and our revenues are up, I think, approximately 50% if my memory serves me correctly. The top 3 products are interest rates and equities and ags are up about 27%, foreign currencies are up about 39%. Our main focus in working with Australia again is within the asset management community, hedge funds and the banks."

So we're continuing to look at the substitute products both from a customer client value proposition, but also from a market share perspective."

It is another solid quarter for us. Average daily volume in Q2 rose by 13%, the same growth rate as our record first quarter.
We had double-digit growth again from each of our buy-side client groups, including asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, corporate and retail. Despite the recent slowdown and volatility post-Brexit as measured by the -- we are tracking up 10% compared with last July.
We were pleased to opening record in the second quarter of over 116 [ph] million contracts, and we are near peaks in our last opening -- data in several product areas. This morning, I will start with our -- drivers and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation despite of the challenging macro environment. We saw robust electronic trading activity outside of the U.S. with Asia up 21% versus Q2 last year. Latin America rose 16%, and Europe rose 12%. Following the Brexit announcement, we had significant activity from outside of the U.Swith 5.3 million contracts traded from Europe and 1.9 million contracts traded from Asia the day after.
In Q2, the electronic volume from outside of the U.S. is 24%. In July, that has jumped to 27%; and the day after Brexit, 29% of the activity was outside of the U.S.
In Europe, volumes in fiber product areas grew by more than 20% with the strongest growth in energy and equity with year-to-date ADV up 38% and 35%, respectively.
In Asia, future ADV and energy rose by more than 140%, and metals volumes jumped more than 80%. Latin America growth has also led by energy. In addition to the country of origin information that we shared with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day.
In Q2, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 40% from 260,000 contracts per day last year to 360,000 this quarter. During European hours, from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m central time, volume rose from 750,000 per day to 1.1 million a day, up almost 45%.
Turning to our -- options, we remain the leader relative to other global exchanges with Q2 options rising 15% and electronic options average daily volume rising 23% to 1.7 million contracts.
In Q2, the percentage of options at trading on Globex reached an all-time high of 57%, up from 51% in Q1. We saw the highest electronic percentage to date in interest rates, energy and metals. Agriculture options reached a record quarterly ADV of 345,000, up 26% from the prior year.
Lastly, in June, we had the highest month ever in total weekly options products with 495,000 contracts per day, up 57%.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio, we had a very impressive quarter with energy, ag and metals, each up more than 20% in revenue. We also set new records a large company just in metals and ag, reaffirming that global customers continue to manage their commodities markets risk exposures at CME Group. We track substitute products very closely, and we have outperformed peers in crude futures, good options, natural gas futures, natural gas options, gold and copper so far in 2016.
Energy was particularly strong with Q2 average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, and July has continued to be robust with volumes up 20%. In Q2, crude was up 38%, natural gas rose 17%, and refined products increased 18%.
The European and Asian activity and energy mentioned earlier highlight our extremely focused attention on our customers globally and the growing relevance of our product set.
Growth in energy options has been meaningful. WTI options volume rose more than 20% to more than 180,000 contracts per day, while natural gas options were up almost 20% as well.
Within energy options, we have grown from 49% electronic in Q1 to 53% in Q2 and up to 57% so far this month.
Energy ADV in the second quarter was the second-highest quarter ever behind the record first quarter this year.
Our metals business during the quarter was phenomenal. Volume was up 41%, and the -- revenues rose 35%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 43%, while copper rose 33% versus a year ago. Options activity was strong, up 32% compared to last year. Metals had a second best quarter ever, and we had outperformed substitute products at exchanges by a significant amount. We were also able to achieve multiple all-time opening records in copper, as well as set the all-time records for large opening holders in both gold and silver in July.
Last but not least, our agriculture business had its highest volume quarter in our history. Ag options rose 26% and futures were up 22%. Soybeans led the way, up 49%; while corn, soybean meal and hard grade each grew more than 20%. It is worth noting that there are increasing expectations the likelihood of La Nina. We would expect that to impact both our cultural volumes, as well as benefiting our natural gas markets.
Turning to financial products and starting with interest rates, average daily volume in Q2 was up 3% and year-to-date, we are up 7%.
Within Eurodollar options, volume increased 28% during the second quarter. Recently, we have had progress developing liquidity and trading in the spring with the electronic percentage increasing from 23% to 25% from Q1 to Q2. Also, the electronic volume during the U.S. hours from the -- open continues to increase significantly. Futures continue to be robust. As we have seen, expectations move around before, during and after the Brexit vote.
Fed funds futures averaged more than 142,000 contracts per day in Q2, up almost 140%. In addition, we spoke about the successful launch of the Ultra 10-Year product last quarter, and volume has dropped from 35,000 contracts per day to over 60,000 and July as tracking at the same level.
We launched options clearing in the second quarter with 5 approved clearing members, and we've now cleared dealer to dealer and customer trades. In addition to Swaptions, our recently launch Brazilian real IRS clearing offering began scaling in June and is now at 24 participants would have cleared the product thus far.
We continue to outperform other markets indicating the proportion of activities shifting to our interest rate futures and options. For example, while we are up 7% year-to-date in interest rate volumes, global dealer-to-clients swap trading volume were down 10% in the dollar fix to floating market. We continue to capture market share in treasury switch we talked about before as cash treasuries are down 5%, while our treasury futures are flat. Our opening interest rates continues to hit record elevated levels above $63 million contracts in March and June, while rate related opening interest at most of our exchanges peaked several years ago.
Turning to equities. ADV was up 25% in Q2 to almost 3 million contracts. And as I mentioned, we have had great participation from clients around the world. We had solid activity in equity options, which grew 24% during the quarter. We were particularly pleased with record of more than 440,000 equity options that trading post-Brexit before the U.S. stock market even opened. In addition, last week we announced the launch of S&P 500 total return index futures and the S&P 500 carrier adjusted total return index futures. These innovative products are intended to mimic the economics of a total return swaps in futures form, allowing swap dealers in the end clients to avoid higher cost as a result of new swap margin rules that are expected on September 1.
This is another example of CME Group's ongoing commitment to meet the changing needs of our clients in an evolving global marketplace. The S&P 500 total return index futures will be available to trade by B -- which is basis trade index at close and will further expand the U.S. major index -- offering, which trade at a record $32 billion in -- during Q2. Lastly, our FX business is down 7% in Q2 as trading environment was challenging pre-Brexit. So far this year, we have outperformed the 2 largest FX platforms in terms of trading activity versus last year. Our FX markets performed very well during the post-Brexit day, but the markets were active and we had record British activity with more than 500,000 contracts traded that day.
Speaking of Brexit, we were very busy after the results came in, particularly during the pre-U.S. hours. We had a record 350 million messages to process. And as a slide in presentation shows, we handled it without any issues. This is a tribute to our hard-working colleagues, who already handled strong activity when volatility spikes.
We have had a tremendous opportunity during the last few months to deeply engage with our global clients as markets growth continues to evolve with uncertainty post-Brexit and also the upcoming implementation of margin for uncleared swaps. We have been talking to folks about the greater regulatory certainty under U.S. regulation. And based on the results again this quarter, it was clear customers at every continent are comfortable with the U.S. regime. This was further solidified with recognition and permanent QCCP status in Europe that we received in June.
The next potential catalyst for increased exchange trading and swaps clearing is in about 5 weeks when the first phase begins in the interdealer market requiring daily initial margin in the region margin to be exchanged on a bilateral common non centrally cleared portfolios in the U.S..
There will be 10 million [ph] margin period of risk that will be put in place for uncleared swaps, and there will be less netting available compared to the 5-day period for cleared swaps and generally 1 to 2 days for futures and options.
Based on many client discussions, we are accelerating internal product development to try to create solutions that can provide relief for participants, including intermediaries and end clients. I mentioned the S&P 500 total return index futures launched prior September 1. Within our interest rate and FX areas, we are examining multiple new product ideas and looking at product construction. Within FX, opportunities we are working on include clearing for OTC FX options and nondeliverable forward. In addition, within rates, we believe this could be a catalyst for our Swaptions business, and they're getting inbound calls from customers about other ideas. Lastly, I mentioned repo clearing last quarter, and we continue to make significant progress on the operational side in terms of technology and clearing, and we are working closely with large banks, asset managers and hedge funds. In addition, we are planning to be operationally prepared to launch fairly soon after regulatory approval.
In summary, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. We have looked hard to position the company for success in the world that needs transparent, clear solutions for risk management now more than ever. With that, I will to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.As Gill mentioned, w",918,"Thank you, Gill, good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.
As Gill mentioned, we had another excellent quarter. Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter in Q2 last year with 4 of our 6 product areas delivering more than 20% revenue growth. Our adjusted expenses, excluding license fees, were flat with the second quarter of last year so almost all of the incremental revenue dropped to the operating income line. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 3 percentage points from a year ago and adjusted EPS was up more than 15% for the second quarter in a row.
This quarter, we removed amortization from our adjusted results, and we've provided a summary of the impact on prior quarters both in our earnings presentation deck, as well as in the income statement trend file we posted on our website. This change puts the reporting of our adjusted results in line with our U.S. exchange peers.
Our repo contract for the second quarter was $0.782, up from $0.756 in Q1 due primarily to a positive shift in product mix, which was slightly offset by the number mix.
Market data revenue was $103 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Moving to expenses, excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense was $270 million, exactly where we were in Q2 2015, which I am pleased to report along with a solid top line growth. For the first half of the year, on new spaces we were at $534 million, up about 1/2 of 1%. For the second half, I would expect expenses to be about $548 million. The increase from the first half is based on our heavier spend on customer-related activity in Q4 and the acceleration of product development, which Gill alluded to. We will be lower than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, which included amortization and excluded license fees by $4 million.
Instead of being up 1%, we are guiding to 0.5% increase on that basis. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,640 employees, up 40 from last quarter, driven primarily by entry level hires and hires in lower cost locations.
Our competition ratio from Q2 came in at 14.5% and is down from 17% in Q2 last year. Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $27 million in net earnings among consolidated subsidiaries, up slightly from Q1. turning to investment income, we received $2.6 million in dividends from BB&F. In addition, our investment returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed funds contributions during Q2, decreased sequentially to $5.2 million from $7 million in Q1.
This is a result of lower average daily investment balances from the prior quarter and our net return during Q2 was 9 basis points. While we have been approved establish an account with the Fed for house cash, it is not live yet, and we continue to work through the operational details.
Turning to taxes, for the quarter, we ended at an adjusted 36.5%, which is where we guided. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.34 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $20 million as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in the expense.
We originally guided to $115 million to $120 million for the year. I'm going to reduce that by $15 million to $100 million to $105 million based on efficiency efforts and timing.
One final item I want to outline today is  the new program we have available for equity members. These firms are required to hold shares of CME Group Class A common stock in addition to seats to receive equity membership privileges.
Under the terms of the program, participants may substitute the assignment of the required shares by paying us a monthly subscription. Currently, there are 370 institutions that are required to hold CME Group Class A common shares as part of their equity membership.
A typical equity member is required to hold 20,000 shares for exchange in addition to seats. For most of the equity members, this subscription rate will be $7500 per month per exchange. This will provide choice for the firms and potentially allow them to free up capital to deploy in other ways. Each of the 370 firms will have full discretion on whether or not to principate in the program. The timing under evaluation and decision to participate is expected to lead to an orderly share release over time and should be easily absorbed by the market. As it is unclear on the participation level, we will update you next quarter on the uptake.
At a 50% participation level, we will generate an estimated $20 million of incremental annual revenue and up to $40 million if all equity members switch to monthly subscription. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility, our efficiency and expenses has been excellent, and since the first of the year, we returned $1.4 billion in dividends. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

So you can look at our rates, our PC, which is publicly available, and you can see that we're running currently at seven -- several million dollars a year in terms of revenues, in terms of the run rate. If you look at Mexican pesos, and our interest rate swaps clearing business, we now offer 19 currencies relative to the large competitor offering, 17 currencies so we got 2 now unique value propositions in terms of currencies, both the Mexican peso and the Brazil real. In terms of the Mexican peso, we have MXN 1.5 million a month is our current run rate. So while it is a small currency, it's actually having a significant impact on that business. With the Brazilian real, as Gill mentioned on the call, we're hitting a critical mass in the month of June. To put in perspective, we launched -- it takes time for the new products to gain traction relative to building a critical mass of participants. In the month of June, we had a $5 billion equivalent total volume cleared in the month of July -- sorry, that was in the month of May. Excuse me, $5 billion in the month of May. In the month of June, we had $35 billion. The Brazilian against unique value proposition relative to our largest competitor, it is a larger currency than Mexican peso, so we do expect eventually to make more in the Brazilian than we are currently making in the Mexican peso. We've had big success in our equity product that we launched in November of last year. The dividend futures, which we've spoken about are running about 1000 day. The bigger and more exciting thing relative to future growth is we've got over 50,000 contracts in open interest. In terms of -- we're trading that's on the S&P 500 in particular, we trading over 5,000 contracts a day. If you look at new products, we hope that they drive typically 3-or-so percent of our top line growth. We have other new products that we're launching with Swaptions. As I said, it takes a while to build a critical mass with the Brazilian real. It took us from August of last year until June of this year to start hitting a critical mass. We do expect with U.S. dollar swaptions to hit a critical mass hopefully in the fourth quarter and to begin to see significant growth starting then. So we see strong growth across each of our product areas with top line of 3% plus. Derek, do you want to jump in?"

Those are market entry opportunities for us. For example, our move into aluminum 18 months ago was a result of customers not being able to access their fiscal aluminum get it out of their warehouse. So the growth in market share and revenue generation on our copper business has been largely helped by our entering the aluminum market. In fact, Miller -- announced just last month that they're going to be shifting their price benchmark for the North American aluminum procurement to a CME-based product that we launched 18 months ago. Looking forward, the other area of product opportunity and development, is where we can add products to our overall portfolio. So as Gill mentioned, we've got record revenue generation in our agriculture products business. We announced last month that we'll be launching our European we contracts on September 12 this year, and that's -- out what is already a global utilized contract with the product that addresses some of the shortcomings in the current products. So great opportunities there, and we're into our portfolio of services, making it easier from a capital perspective and operational asset perspective for our customers to manage all the risk at CME Group. That's been our focal point for product development."

The metals business, specifically, is our second biggest revenue source in the same region. That's up 61%. So the opportunity set that we've got when we owned the benchmarks from the metal side, our ability to position ourselves as a global benchmarks in region with the sales effort that Brian and his team has been pulling forth in region to make sure that we're accessing a customer base with global liquidity, by time zone as well, that's how we see the opportunity continue to build into that community. I would also like to add that if you look at the importance of the commercial customers who work on these complex, as a whole, we continue to focus on than being a primary driver of our access because as you address those end-user customer needs, that brings the other market participants the profit to banks the others that want to be where the end-user customers are.

And we're at a point now where we said we've got a balance sustainable participation level across the franchise as a whole. Energy is up 25%. We've always been Brent as important part of the overall story. The market is telling us that once the trade WTI and we look at the differential fortunes between what's happening between what happens on the WTI side of the fence and we're proud our business is up about 45%, 48% in -- this is up about 19% the market is only wants to trade on the WTI side of the ledger. So we've been successful with the commercial participation. And we believe at this point, we're happy to be able to start to scale back some of those incentives that the liquidity itself is sufficient to be able to maintain participation in the market. So at any time the marketmaker and some place, they're always by nature temporary. Interest successful the value proposition that will hold once you remove the incentives.

So when you couple together the huge growth that we're seeing in the core franchise, we're seeing the large open interest holder record levels, we're seeing commercial participation and revenue generation from the commercial participants at record level, we actually find that our business is able is beyond just any particular single product size. But when you talk about individual views of nat gas itself, but our nat gas franchise year-to-date is up 12%, and -- revenue is actually down 4% in nat gas. And but when you go to a pre-FX launch, we're about 65% of the nat gas options market. NASDAQ is about 35%. If you look at the rolling 60-day average, we've actually increased our market share since -- launch where 68%, [indiscernible] 20% and FX is about 12%. So when you actually look at -- you had a 2 [ph] man race [ph] were 65% of the market, and the 3 man [ph] race were 68% of the market, that same bigger market. So when we talk to our customers, what's important to them is the full range of products and services inside the asset class. So we think about the 76% market share we had in the nat gas futures. The growth in percentage market share, which we're getting paid by our customers to deliver on top of the fact that the overall franchise and TI -- I mean, talk about the footprint were generated in China right now, that's where our customers want access to. They want to access the global prices. They want to access to a product where you have global participation from the commercial side and international footprint side, and where we are in the process of electronifying the nat gas options business because that's what makes you sticky. I want to remind everybody that when you look at the NFX value proposition, they said, we're going to do it free and we're going to do it at a block basis. But you've heard us build markets for 15 years by electronifying them. So you're thinking our nat gas options from 5% electronic to 25% of electronic over the last 18 months, that's why you're seeing this grow outside of the market share in revenue-generating products like nat gas options and you'll see us continue to push that with the overall revenue story as well. So our revenue growth is up 21% in energy as a whole, -- revenue growth is up 14% in energy, and NASDAQ is in energy, I guess, either flat, maybe negative based on the incentives that came out."

It is another solid quarter for us. Average daily volume in Q2 rose by 13%, the same growth rate as our record first quarter.
We had double-digit growth again from each of our buy-side client groups, including asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, corporates and retail. Despite the recent slowdown and volatility post-Brexit as measured by the VIX, we are tracking up 10% compared with last July.
We were pleased to set an open interest record in the second quarter of over 116 million contracts, and we are near peaks in our large open interest holders data in several product areas. This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macroenvironment. We saw robust electronic trading activity outside of the U.S. with Asia up 21% versus Q2 last year, Latin America rose 16% and Europe rose 12%. Following the Brexit announcement, we had significant activity from outside of the U.S. with 5.3 million contracts traded from Europe and 1.9 million contracts traded from Asia the day after.
In Q2, the electronic volume from outside of the U.S. is 24%. In July, that has jumped to 27%; and the day after Brexit, 29% of the activity was outside of the U.S.
In Europe, volumes in five of our product areas grew by more than 20% with the strongest growth in energy and equities with year-to-date ADV up 38% and 35%, respectively.
In Asia, future ADV and energy rose by more than 140%, and metals volumes jumped more than 80%. Latin America growth was also led by energy. In addition to the country of origin information that we shared with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day.
In Q2, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 40% from 260,000 contracts per day last year to 360,000 this quarter. During European hours, from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m central time, volume rose from 750,000 per day to 1.1 million a day, up almost 45%.
Turning to our efforts in options. We remain a  leader relative to other global exchanges with Q2 options rising 15% and electronic options average daily volume rising 23% to 1.7 million contracts.
In Q2, the percentage of options that traded on Globex reached an all-time high of 57%, up from 51% in Q1. We saw the highest electronic percentage to date in interest rates, energy and metals. Agriculture options reached a record quarterly ADV of 345,000, up 26% from the prior year.
Lastly, in June, we had the highest month ever in total weekly options products with 495,000 contracts per day, up 57%.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had a very impressive quarter with energy, ag and metals, each up more than 20% in revenue. We also set new records of large open interest holders in metals and ag, reaffirming that global customers continue to manage their commodities markets' risk exposures at CME Group. We track substitute products very closely, and we have outperformed peers in crude futures, crude options, natural gas futures, natural gas options, gold and copper so far in 2016.
Energy was particularly strong with Q2 average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, and July has continued to be robust with volumes up 20%. In Q2, crude was up 38%, natural gas rose 17%, and refined products increased 18%.
The European and Asian activity in energy mentioned earlier highlights our extremely focused attention on our customers globally and the growing relevance of our product set.
Growth in energy options has been meaningful. WTI options volume rose more than 20% to more than 180,000 contracts per day, while natural gas options were up almost 20% as well.
Within energy options, we have grown from 49% electronic in Q1 to 53% in Q2 and up to 57% so far this month.
Energy ADV in the second quarter was the second highest quarter ever behind the record first quarter this year.
Our metals business during the quarter was phenomenal. Volume was up 41% and transaction revenues rose 35%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 43%, while copper rose 33% versus a year ago. Options activity was strong, up 32% compared to last year. Metals had a second best quarter ever, and we had outperformed substitute products at other exchanges by a significant amount. We were also able to achieve multiple all-time open interest records in copper as well as set the all-time records for large open interest holders in both gold and silver in July.
Last but not least, our agriculture business had its highest volume quarter in our history. Ag options rose 26% and futures were up 22%. Soybeans led the way, up 49%, while corn, soybean meal and Hard Red Winter Wheat each grew more than 20%. It is worth noting that they are increasing expectations of the likelihood of La Nina. We would expect that to impact both agricultural volumes as well as benefiting our natural gas markets.
Turning to financial products and starting with interest rates, average daily volume in Q2 was up 3% and year-to-date we are up 7%.
Within Eurodollar options, volume increased 28% during the second quarter. Recently, we have had progress developing liquidity and trading on the screen with the electronic percentage increasing from 23% to 25% from Q1 to Q2. Also, the electronic volume during the U.S. hours from the pits that are open continues to increase significantly. Fed fund futures continued to be robust. As we have seen, Fed expectations move around before, during and after the Brexit vote.
Fed funds futures averaged more than 142,000 contracts per day in Q2, up almost 140%. In addition, we spoke about the successful launch of the Ultra 10-Year product last quarter, and volume has jumped from 35,000 contracts per day to over 60,000 and July is tracking at that same level.
We launched options clearing in the second quarter with 5 approved clearing members, and we'll now cleared dealer-to-dealer and customer trades. In addition to Swaptions, our recently launched Brazilian real IRS clearing offering began scaling in June and we now have 24 participants who have cleared the product thus far.
We continue to outperform other related markets indicating the proportion of activities shifting to our interest rate futures and options. For example, while we are up 7% year-to-date in interest rate volumes, global dealer-to-clients swap trading volumes were down 10% in the dollar fix to floating market. We continued to capture market share in treasuries, which we talked about before as cash treasuries are down 5%, while our treasury futures are flat. Our open interest in rates continues to hit record elevated levels above $63 million contracts in March and June, while rate related open interest at most of our exchanges peaked several years ago.
Turning to equities. ADV was up 25% in Q2 to almost 3 million contracts. And as I mentioned, we have had great participation from clients around the world. We had solid activity in equity options, which grew 24% during the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the record of more than 440,000 equity options that traded post-Brexit before the U.S. stock market even opened. 
In addition, last week, we announced the launch of S&P 500 Total Return Index futures and the S&P 500 Carry Adjusted Total Return Index futures. These innovative products are intended to mimic the economics of a total return swap in futures form, allowing swap dealers and their end clients to avoid higher costs as a result of new swap margin rules that are expected on September 1.
This is another example of CME Group's ongoing commitment to meet the changing needs of our clients in an evolving global marketplace. The S&P 500 Total Return Index futures will be available to trade by BTIC, which is Basis Trade Index at Close and will further expand the U.S. major index BTIC offering, which traded a record $32 billion in notional value during Q2. 
Lastly, our FX business was down 7% in Q2 as trading environment was challenging pre-Brexit. So far this year, we have outperformed the 2 largest FX platforms in terms of trading activity versus last year. Our FX markets performed very well during the post-Brexit day, but the markets were active and we had record British pound activity with more than 500,000 contracts traded that day.
Speaking of Brexit, we were very busy after the results came in, particularly during the pre-U.S. hours. We had a record 350 million messages to process. And as the slide in our presentation shows, we handled it without any issues. This is a tribute to our hard-working colleagues, who are ready to handle strong activity when volatility spiked.
We have had a tremendous opportunity during the last few months to deeply engage with our global clients as markets growth continued to evolve with uncertainty post-Brexit and also the upcoming implementation of margin for uncleared swaps. We have been talking to folks about the greater regulatory certainty under U.S. regulation. And based on the results again this quarter, it is clear customers at every continent are comfortable with the U.S. regime. This was further solidified with recognition and permanent QCCP status in Europe that we received in June.
The next potential catalyst for increased exchange trading and swaps clearing is in about 5 weeks when the first phase begins in the interdealer market requiring daily initial margin in variation region margin to be exchanged on a bilateral common noncentrally cleared portfolios in the U.S..
There will be a 10-day margin period of risk that will be put in place for uncleared swaps, and there will be less netting available compared to the 5-day period for cleared swaps and generally 1 to 2 days for futures and options.
Based on many client discussions, we are accelerating internal product development to try to create solutions that can provide relief for participants, including intermediaries and end clients. I mentioned the S&P 500 Total Return Index futures launched prior to September 1. Within our interest rate and FX areas, we are examining multiple new product ideas and looking at product construction. Within FX, opportunities we are working on include clearing for OTC FX options and nondeliverable forwards. 
In addition, within rates, we believe this could be a catalyst for our Swaptions business, and they're getting inbound calls from customers about other ideas. Lastly, I mentioned repo clearing last quarter, and we continued to make significant progress on the operational side in terms of technology and clearing, and we are working closely with large banks, asset managers and hedge funds. In addition, we are planning to be operationally prepared to launch fairly soon after regulatory approval.
In summary, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. We have worked hard to position the company for success in the world that needs transparent, clear solutions for risk management now more than ever. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.As Gill mentione",924,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.
As Gill mentioned, we had another excellent quarter. Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter in Q2 last year with 4 of our 6 product areas delivering more than 20% revenue growth. Our adjusted expenses, excluding license fees were flat with the second quarter of last year, so almost all of the incremental revenue dropped to the operating income line. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 3 percentage points from a year ago and adjusted EPS was up more than 15% for the second quarter in a row.
This quarter, we removed amortization from our adjusted results, and we provided a summary of the impact on prior quarters both in our earnings presentation deck, as well as in the income statement trend file we posted on our website. This change puts the reporting of our adjusted results in line with our U.S. exchange peers.
Our rate per contract for the second quarter was $0.782, up from $0.756 in Q1 due primarily to a positive shift in product mix, which was slightly offset by the member --  nonmember mix.
Market data revenue was $103 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense was $270 million, exactly where we were in Q2 2015, which I am pleased to report along with the solid top line growth. For the first half of the year, on new spaces, we were at $534 million, up about 1/2 of 1%. For the second half, I would expect expenses to be about $548 million. The increase from the first half is based on our heavier spend on customer-related activity in Q4 and the acceleration of product development, which Gill alluded to. We will be lower than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, which included amortization and excluded license fees by $4 million.
Instead of being up 1%, we are guiding to 0.5% increase on that basis. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,640 employees, up 40 from last quarter, driven primarily by entry-level hires and hires in lower cost locations.
Our competition ratio from Q2 came in at 14.5% and is down from 17% in Q2 last year. Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $27 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, up slightly from Q1. 
Turning to investment income. We received $2.6 million in dividends from BB&F. In addition, our investment returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed funds contributions during Q2, decreased sequentially to $5.2 million from $7 million in Q1.
This is a result of lower average daily investment balances from the prior quarter and our net return during Q2 was 9 basis points. While we have been approved to establish an account with the Fed for house cash, it is not live yet, and we continue to work through the operational details.
Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at an adjusted 36.5%, which is where we guided. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.34 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $20 million, as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense.
We originally guided to $115 million to $120 million for the year. I'm going to reduce that by $15 million to $100 million to $105 million based on efficiency efforts and timing.
One final item I want to outline today is  a new program we have available for equity members. These firms are required to hold shares of CME Group Class A common stock in addition to seats to receive equity membership privileges.
Under the terms of the program, participants may substitute the assignment of the required shares by paying us a monthly subscription. Currently, there are 370 institutions that are required to hold CME Group Class A common shares as part of their equity membership.
A typical equity member is required to hold 20,000 shares per exchange in addition to seats. For most of the equity members, the subscription rate will be $7500 per month per exchange. This will provide choice for the firms and potentially allow them to free up capital to deploy in other ways. Each of the 370 firms will have full discretion on whether or not to participate in the program. The timing under evaluation and decision to participate is expected to lead to an orderly share release over time and should be easily absorbed by the market. As it is unclear on the participation level, we will update you next quarter on the uptake.
At a 50% participation level, we would generate an estimated $20 million of incremental annual revenue and up to $40 million if all equity members switch to monthly subscription. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent, and since the first of the year, we have returned $1.4 billion in dividends. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.

In terms of the bottom line on these products, if you look at the TN as Gill mentioned, we were doing 60,000 contracts a day. So you can look at our rates RPC, which is publicly available, and you can see that we're running currently at several million dollars a year in terms of revenues, in terms of the run rate. If you look at Mexican pesos and our interest rate swaps clearing business, we now offer 19 currencies relative to the large competitor offering 17 currencies. So we got 2 now unique value propositions in terms of currencies, both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. In terms of the Mexican peso, we have MXN 1.5 million a month is our current run rate. So while it is a small currency, it's actually having a significant impact on that business. If you look at the Brazilian reai, as Gill mentioned on the call, we're hitting a critical mass in the month of June. To put in perspective, we launched -- it takes time for the new products to gain traction relative to building a critical mass of participants. In the month of June, we had a $5 billion equivalent. Total volume cleared in the month of July -- sorry, that was in the month of May. Excuse me, $5 billion in the month of May. In the month of June, we had $35 billion. The Brazilian real against unique value proposition relative to our largest competitor, it is a larger currency than Mexican peso, so we do expect eventually to make more in the Brazilian real than we are currently making in the Mexican peso. We had big success in our equity products that were launched in November of last year. The dividend futures, which we've spoken about are running about 1,000 day. The bigger and more exciting thing relative to future growth is we've got over 50,000 contracts in open interest. In terms of BTIC, we're trading that's on the S&P 500 in particular. We're trading 5,000 contracts a day. If you look at new products, we hope that they drive typically 3-or-so percent of our top line growth. We have other new products that we're launching with Swaptions. As I said, it takes a while to build a critical mass. With the Brazilian real, it took us from August of last year until June of this year to start hitting a critical mass. We do expect with U.S. dollar swaptions to hit a critical mass hopefully in the fourth quarter and to begin to see significant growth starting then. So we see strong growth across each of our product areas with top line of 3% plus. Derek, do you want to jump in?"

And that's the way to think about product developments and opportunities is where there are global benchmarks that might be in this repair or broken benchmarks. Clients not able to manage a risk the way they could. Those are market entry opportunities for us. For example, our move into aluminum 18 months ago was a result of customers not being able to access their fiscal aluminum get it out of their warehouse. So the growth in market share and revenue generation on our copper business has been largely helped by our entering the aluminum market. In fact, MillerCoors announced just last month that they're going to be shifting their price benchmark for the North American aluminum procurement to a CME-based product that we launched 18 months ago. Looking forward, the other area of product opportunity and development, is where we can add products to our overall portfolio. So as Gill mentioned, we've hit record revenue generation in our agriculture products business. We announced last month that we'll be launching our European wheat contracts on September 12 of this year and that fills out what is already a globally utilized contract with the products that addresses some of the shortcomings in the current products. So great opportunities there and we're into our portfolio of services, making it easier from a capital perspective and operational asset perspective for our customers to manage all the risk at CME Group. That's been our focal point for product development."

Our business in greater China, mean Hong Kong, China and Taiwan is up 227%. The metals business, specifically, is our second biggest revenue source in the same region and that's up 61%. So the opportunities that we've got when we own the COMEX benchmarks from the metal side, our ability to position ourselves as a global benchmarks in region with the sales efforts that Brian and his team has been putting forth in region to make sure that we're accessing a customer base with global liquidity by time zone as well, that's how we see the opportunity continue to build into that community. I would also like to add that if you look at the importance of the commercial customers who are commodities complex as a whole, we continued to focus on them being is the primary driver of our access, because as you address those end-user customer needs, that brings the other market participants, the profit to banks, the others that want to be where the end-user customers are.

And we're at a point now where we said we think we've got a sustainable participation level across the franchise as a whole. Energy is up 25%. We've always said Brent is an important part of the overall story. The market is telling us it wants to trade WTI, and we look at the differential fortunes between what's happening between -- what happens on the WTI side of the fence. We're proud our business is up about 45%, 48% and ICE's Brent is up about 19%. The market is telling you it wants to trade on the WTI side of the ledger. So we've been successful with the commercial participation. And we believe at this point, we're happy to be able to start to scale back some of those incentives that the liquidity itself is sufficient to be able to maintain participation in the market. So in any time if the market maker incentive is in place, they're always by nature temporary. if you're successful at the value proposition, that will hold once you remove the incentives.

So when you couple together the huge growth that we're seeing in the core franchise, we're seeing the large open interest holder record levels, we're seeing commercial participation and revenue generation from the commercial participants at record level. We actually find that our business as a whole is beyond just any particular single product size. But when you talk about individual views on the nat gas itself, but our nat gas franchise year-to-date is up 12% and ICE's revenue was actually down 4% in nat gas. And but when you go to a pre-FX launch, we're about 65% of the nat gas options market. NASDAQ is about 35%. If you look at the rolling 60-day average, we've actually increased our market share since NFX was launched, we're 68%, ICE is 20%, NFX is about 12%. So when you actually look at in a 2-man race, we're 65% of the market, in a 3-man race, we're 68% of the market, that's a bigger market. So when we talk to our customers, what's important to them is the full range of products and services inside the asset class. So we think about the 76% market share we had in the nat gas futures. The growing percentage market share, which we're getting paid by our customers to deliver on top of the fact that the overall franchise and TI, and we talked about the footprint we've generated in China right now, that's what our customers want access to. They want to access the global prices, they want to access to a product where you have global participation from the commercial side and international footprint side, and where we are in a process of electronifying the nat gas options, business because that's what makes you sticky. I want to remind everybody that when you look at the NFX value prop, they said, we're going to do it free, and we're going to do it at a block basis. But you've heard us build markets for 15 years by electronifying them. So you're taking our nat gas options from 5% electronic to 25% of electronic over the last 18 months, that's why you're seeing this grow outside the market share in revenue-generating products like nat gas options and you'll see us continue to push that with the overall revenue story as well. So our revenue growth is up 21% in energy as a whole, -- revenue growth is up 14% in energy, and NASDAQ is in energy, I guess, either flat, maybe negative based on the incentives they're paying out."

It is another solid quarter for us. Average daily volume in Q2 rose by 13%, the same growth rate as our record first quarter.
We had double-digit growth again from each of our buy-side client groups, including asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, corporates and retail. Despite the recent slowdown and volatility post-Brexit as measured by the VIX, we are tracking up 10% compared with last July.
We were pleased to set an open interest record in the second quarter of over 116 million contracts, and we are near peaks in our large open interest holders data in several product areas. This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macroenvironment. We saw robust electronic trading activity outside of the U.S. with Asia up 21% versus Q2 last year, Latin America rose 16% and Europe rose 12%. Following the Brexit announcement, we had significant activity from outside of the U.S. with 5.3 million contracts traded from Europe and 1.9 million contracts traded from Asia the day after.
In Q2, the electronic volume from outside of the U.S. is 24%. In July, that has jumped to 27%; and the day after Brexit, 29% of the activity was outside of the U.S.
In Europe, volumes in five of our product areas grew by more than 20% with the strongest growth in energy and equities with year-to-date ADV up 38% and 35%, respectively.
In Asia, future ADV and energy rose by more than 140%, and metals volumes jumped more than 80%. Latin America growth was also led by energy. In addition to the country of origin information that we shared with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day.
In Q2, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 40% from 260,000 contracts per day last year to 360,000 this quarter. During European hours, from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m central time, volume rose from 750,000 per day to 1.1 million a day, up almost 45%.
Turning to our efforts in options. We remain a  leader relative to other global exchanges with Q2 options rising 15% and electronic options average daily volume rising 23% to 1.7 million contracts.
In Q2, the percentage of options that traded on Globex reached an all-time high of 57%, up from 51% in Q1. We saw the highest electronic percentage to date in interest rates, energy and metals. Agriculture options reached a record quarterly ADV of 345,000, up 26% from the prior year.
Lastly, in June, we had the highest month ever in total weekly options products with 495,000 contracts per day, up 57%.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had a very impressive quarter with energy, ag and metals, each up more than 20% in revenue. We also set new records of large open interest holders in metals and ag, reaffirming that global customers continue to manage their commodities markets' risk exposures at CME Group. We track substitute products very closely, and we have outperformed peers in crude futures, crude options, natural gas futures, natural gas options, gold and copper so far in 2016.
Energy was particularly strong with Q2 average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, and July has continued to be robust with volumes up 20%. In Q2, crude was up 38%, natural gas rose 17%, and refined products increased 18%.
The European and Asian activity in energy mentioned earlier highlights our extremely focused attention on our customers globally and the growing relevance of our product set.
Growth in energy options has been meaningful. WTI options volume rose more than 20% to more than 180,000 contracts per day, while natural gas options were up almost 20% as well.
Within energy options, we have grown from 49% electronic in Q1 to 53% in Q2 and up to 57% so far this month.
Energy ADV in the second quarter was the second highest quarter ever behind the record first quarter this year.
Our metals business during the quarter was phenomenal. Volume was up 41% and transaction revenues rose 35%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 43%, while copper rose 33% versus a year ago. Options activity was strong, up 32% compared to last year. Metals had a second best quarter ever, and we had outperformed substitute products at other exchanges by a significant amount. We were also able to achieve multiple all-time open interest records in copper as well as set the all-time records for large open interest holders in both gold and silver in July.
Last but not least, our agriculture business had its highest volume quarter in our history. Ag options rose 26% and futures were up 22%. Soybeans led the way, up 49%, while corn, soybean meal and Hard Red Winter Wheat each grew more than 20%. It is worth noting that they are increasing expectations of the likelihood of La Nina. We would expect that to impact both agricultural volumes as well as benefiting our natural gas markets.
Turning to financial products and starting with interest rates, average daily volume in Q2 was up 3% and year-to-date we are up 7%.
Within Eurodollar options, volume increased 28% during the second quarter. Recently, we have had progress developing liquidity and trading on the screen with the electronic percentage increasing from 23% to 25% from Q1 to Q2. Also, the electronic volume during the U.S. hours when the pits are open continues to increase significantly. Fed fund futures continued to be robust, as we have seen Fed expectations move around before, during and after the Brexit vote.
Fed funds futures averaged more than 142,000 contracts per day in Q2, up almost 140%. In addition, we spoke about the successful launch of the Ultra 10-Year product last quarter, and volume has jumped from 35,000 contracts per day to over 60,000 and July is tracking at that same level.
We launched options clearing in the second quarter with 5 approved clearing members, and we've now cleared dealer-to-dealer and customer trades. In addition to Swaptions, our recently launched Brazilian real IRS clearing offering began scaling in June and we now have 24 participants who have cleared the product thus far.
We continue to outperform other related markets indicating the proportion of activities shifting to our interest rate futures and options. For example, while we are up 7% year-to-date in interest rate volumes, global dealer-to-client swap clearing volumes were down 10% in the dollar fix to floating market. We continued to capture market share in treasuries, which we talked about before as cash treasuries are down 5%, while our treasury futures are flat. Our open interest in rates continues to hit record elevated levels above $63 million contracts in March and June, while rate related open interest at most of our exchanges peaked several years ago.
Turning to equities. ADV was up 25% in Q2 to almost 3 million contracts. And as I mentioned, we have had great participation from clients around the world. We had solid activity in equity options, which grew 24% during the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the record of more than 440,000 equity options that traded post-Brexit before the U.S. stock market even opened. 
In addition, last week, we announced the launch of S&P 500 Total Return Index futures and the S&P 500 Carry Adjusted Total Return Index futures. These innovative products are intended to mimic the economics of a total return swap in futures form, allowing swap dealers and their end clients to avoid higher costs as a result of new swap margin rules that are expected on September 1.
This is another example of CME Group's ongoing commitment to meet the changing needs of our clients in an evolving global marketplace. The S&P 500 Total Return Index futures will be available to trade by BTIC, which is Basis Trade Index at Close and will further expand the U.S. major index BTIC offering, which traded a record $32 billion in notional value during Q2. 
Lastly, our FX business was down 7% in Q2 as the trading environment was challenging pre-Brexit. So far this year, we have outperformed the 2 largest FX platforms in terms of trading activity versus last year. Our FX markets performed very well during the post-Brexit day when the markets were active and we had record British pound activity with more than 500,000 contracts traded that day.
Speaking of Brexit, we were very busy after the results came in, particularly during the pre-U.S. hours. We had a record 350 million messages to process. And as the slide in our presentation shows, we handled it without any issues. This is a tribute to our hard-working colleagues, who are ready to handle strong activity when volatility spiked.
We have had a tremendous opportunity during the last few months to deeply engage with our global clients as markets growth continued to evolve with uncertainty post-Brexit and also the upcoming implementation of margin for uncleared swaps. We have been talking to folks about the greater regulatory certainty under U.S. regulation. And based on the results again this quarter, it is clear customers at every continent are comfortable with the U.S. regime. This was further solidified with recognition and permanent QCCP status in Europe that we received in June.
The next potential catalyst for increased exchange trading and swaps clearing is in about 5 weeks when the first phase begins in the interdealer market requiring daily initial margin in variation region margin to be exchanged on a bilateral noncentrally cleared portfolios in the U.S..
There will be a 10-day margin period of risk that will be put in place for uncleared swaps, and there will be less netting available compared to the 5-day period for cleared swaps and generally 1 to 2 days for futures and options.
Based on many client discussions, we are accelerating internal product development to try to create solutions that can provide relief for participants, including intermediaries and end clients. I mentioned the S&P 500 Total Return Index futures launched prior to September 1. Within our interest rate and FX areas, we are examining multiple new product ideas and looking at product construction. Within FX, opportunities we are working on include clearing for OTC FX options and nondeliverable forwards. 
In addition, within rates, we believe this could be a catalyst for our Swaptions business, and they're getting inbound calls from customers about other ideas. Lastly, I mentioned repo clearing last quarter, and we continued to make significant progress on the operational side in terms of technology and clearing, and we are working closely with large banks, asset managers and hedge funds. In addition, we are planning to be operationally prepared to launch fairly soon after regulatory approval.
In summary, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. We have worked hard to position the company for success in the world that needs transparent, clear solutions for risk management now more than ever. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,347782602,1016427,"CME Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.As Gill mentione",922,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.
As Gill mentioned, we had another excellent quarter. Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter in Q2 last year with 4 of our 6 product areas delivering more than 20% revenue growth. Our adjusted expenses, excluding license fees were flat with the second quarter of last year, so almost all of the incremental revenue dropped to the operating income line. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 3 percentage points from a year ago and adjusted EPS was up more than 15% for the second quarter in a row.
This quarter, we removed amortization from our adjusted results, and we provided a summary of the impact on prior quarters both in our earnings presentation deck, as well as in the income statement trend file we posted on our website. This change puts the reporting of our adjusted results in line with our U.S. exchange peers.
Our rate per contract for the second quarter was $0.782, up from $0.756 in Q1 due primarily to a positive shift in product mix, which was slightly offset by the member-nonmember mix.
Market data revenue was $103 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense was $270 million, exactly where we were in Q2 2015, which I am pleased to report along with the solid top line growth. For the first half of the year, on this basis, we were at $534 million, up about 1/2 of 1%. For the second half, I would expect expenses to be about $548 million. The increase from the first half is based on our heavier spend on customer-related activity in Q4 and the acceleration of product development, which Gill alluded to. We will be lower than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, which included amortization and excluded license fees by $4 million.
Instead of being up 1%, we are guiding to 0.5% increase on that basis. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,640 employees, up 40 from last quarter, driven primarily by entry-level hires and hires in lower cost locations.
Our competition ratio from Q2 came in at 14.5% and is down from 17% in Q2 last year. Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $27 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, up slightly from Q1. 
Turning to investment income. We received $2.6 million in dividends from BB&F. In addition, our investment returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed funds contributions during Q2, decreased sequentially to $5.2 million from $7 million in Q1.
This is a result of lower average daily investment balances from the prior quarter and our net return during Q2 was 9 basis points. While we have been approved to establish an account with the Fed for house cash, it is not live yet, and we continue to work through the operational details.
Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at an adjusted 36.5%, which is where we guided. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.34 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $20 million, as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense.
We originally guided to $115 million to $120 million for the year. I'm going to reduce that by $15 million to $100 million to $105 million based on efficiency efforts and timing.
One final item I want to outline today is a new program we have available for equity members. These firms are required to hold shares of CME Group Class A common stock in addition to seats to receive equity membership privileges.
Under the terms of the program, participants may substitute the assignment of their required shares by paying us a monthly subscription. Currently, there are 370 institutions that are required to hold CME Group Class A common shares as part of their equity membership.
A typical equity member is required to hold 20,000 shares per exchange in addition to seats. For most of the equity members, the subscription rate will be $7500 per month per exchange. This will provide choice for the firms and potentially allow them to free up capital to deploy in other ways. Each of the 370 firms will have full discretion on whether or not to participate in the program. The timing under evaluation and decision to participate is expected to lead to an orderly share release over time and should be easily absorbed by the market. As it is unclear on the participation level, we will update you next quarter on the uptake.
At a 50% participation level, we would generate an estimated $20 million of incremental annual revenue and up to $40 million if all equity members switch to monthly subscription. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent, and since the first of the year, we have returned $1.4 billion in dividends. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.

In terms of the bottom line on these products, if you look at the TN as Gill mentioned, we were doing 60,000 contracts a day. So you can look at our rates RPC, which is publicly available, and you can see that we're running currently at several million dollars a year in terms of revenues, in terms of the run rate. If you look at Mexican pesos and our interest rate swaps clearing business, we now offer 19 currencies relative to the large competitor offering 17 currencies. So we got 2 now unique value propositions in terms of currencies, both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. In terms of the Mexican peso, we have MXN 1.5 million a month is our current run rate. So while it is a small currency, it's actually having a significant impact on that business. If you look at the Brazilian real, as Gill mentioned on the call, we're hitting a critical mass in the month of June. To put in perspective, we launched -- it takes time for the new products to gain traction relative to building a critical mass of participants. In the month of June, we had a $5 billion equivalent. Total volume cleared in the month of July -- sorry, that was in the month of May. Excuse me, $5 billion in the month of May. In the month of June, we had $35 billion. The Brazilian real against unique value proposition relative to our largest competitor, it is a larger currency than Mexican peso, so we do expect eventually to make more in the Brazilian real than we are currently making in the Mexican peso. We had a big success in our equity products that were launched in November of last year. The dividend futures, which we've spoken about are running about 1,000 day. The bigger and more exciting thing relative to future growth is we've got over 50,000 contracts in open interest. In terms of BTIC, we're trading that's on the S&P 500 in particular. We're trading over 5,000 contracts a day. If you look at new products, we hope that they drive typically 3-or-so percent of our top line growth. We have other new products that we're launching with Swaptions. As I said, it takes a while to build a critical mass. With the Brazilian real, it took us from August of last year until June of this year to start hitting a critical mass. We do expect with U.S. dollar swaptions to hit a critical mass hopefully in the fourth quarter and to begin to see significant growth starting then. So we see strong growth across each of our product areas with top line of 3% plus. Derek, do you want to jump in?"

And that's the way to think about product developments and opportunities is where there are global benchmarks that might be in this repair or broken benchmarks. Clients not able to manage a risk the way they could. Those are market entry opportunities for us. For example, our move into aluminum 18 months ago was a result of customers not being able to access their physical aluminum and get it out of their warehouses. So the growth in market share and revenue generation on our copper business has been largely helped by our entering the aluminum market. In fact, MillerCoors announced just last month that they're going to be shifting their price benchmark for the North American aluminum procurement to a CME-based product that we launched 18 months ago. Looking forward, the other area of product opportunity and development, is where we can add products to our overall portfolio. So as Gill mentioned, we've hit record revenue generation in our agriculture products business. We announced last month that we'll be launching our European wheat contracts on September 12 of this year and that fills out what is already a globally utilized contract with a product that addresses some of the shortcomings in the current products. So great opportunities there and where it fits into our portfolio of services, making it easier from a capital perspective and operational asset perspective for our customers to manage all the risk at CME Group. That's been our focal point for product development."

If you look at the energy revenues we generated year-to-date, energy revenues is now representing almost 35% of the total revenues we're generating out of China and greater China as a whole. Our business in greater China, meaning Hong Kong, China and Taiwan is up 227%. The metals business, specifically, is our second biggest revenue source in the same region and that's up 61%. So the opportunities that we've got when we own the COMEX benchmarks from the metal side, our ability to position ourselves as a global benchmark in region with the sales efforts that Brian and his team has been putting forth in region to make sure that we're accessing a customer base with global liquidity by time zone as well, that's how we see the opportunity continue to build into that community. I would also like to add that if you look at the importance of the commercial customers to our commodities complex as a whole, we've continued to focus on them being is the primary driver of our access, because as you address those end-user customer needs, that brings the other market participants, the profit to banks, the others that want to be where the end-user customers are. So whether you look at the revenue growth of the franchise as a whole, the record level of large open interest holders, the record level open interest itself layered on top of the China growth, tells a story of globalized participation in our markets and globalizing access to those global participant based on the commercial side."

I think that we've been building our market share in Brent and really building our global participation in Brent. And when you build markets and you enter where the incumbent is already present, you need to answer by providing incentives to make it easy to access and where you don't make it too economically painful. So what we've done is over the last probably 24 months or so, we've looked at the traction we've gotten, 10%, 12%, 13%, and we've now actually rolled out our Brent options market as well last quarter. And we're at a point now where we said we think we've got a sustainable participation level across the franchise as a whole. Energy is up 25%. We've always said Brent is an important part of the overall story. The market is telling us it wants to trade WTI, and we look at the differential fortunes between what's happening between -- what happens on the WTI side of the fence where our business is up about 45%, 48% and ICE's Brent is up about 19%. The market is telling you it wants to trade on the WTI side of the ledger. So we've been successful with the commercial participation. And we believe at this point, we're happy to be able to start to scale back some of those incentives that the liquidity itself is sufficient to be able to maintain participation in the market. So in any type of market maker incentive is in place, they're always by nature temporary. if you're successful at the value proposition, that will hold once you remove the incentives. I think the overall performance of the franchise speaks to the success and the value we're bringing to the commercial participants."

We're seeing the significant growth uptake on the WTI side of the ledger. We're also seeing significant growth in the electronic side of our business. So when you couple together the huge growth that we're seeing in the core franchise, we're seeing the large open interest holder record levels, we're seeing commercial participation and revenue generation from the commercial participants at record level. We actually find that our business as a whole is beyond just any particular single product size. But when you talk about individual views on the nat gas itself, but our nat gas franchise year-to-date is up 12% and ICE's revenue was actually down 4% in nat gas. And but when you go to a pre-FX launch, we're about 65% of the nat gas options market. NASDAQ is about 35%. If you look at the rolling 60-day average, we've actually increased our market share since NFX was launched, we're 68%, ICE is 20%, NFX is about 12%. So when you actually look at in a 2-man race, we're 65% of the market, in a 3-man race, we're 68% of the market, that's a bigger market. So when we talk to our customers, what's important to them is the full range of products and services inside the asset class. So we think about the 76% market share we have in the nat gas futures. The growing percentage market share, which we're getting paid by our customers to deliver on top of the fact that the overall franchise and TI, and we talked about the footprint we've generated in China right now, that's what our customers want access to. They want to access the global prices, they want to access to a product where you have global participation from the commercial side and international footprint side, and where we are in a process of electronifying the nat gas options, business because that's what makes you sticky. I want to remind everybody that when you look at the NFX value prop, they said, we're going to do it free, and we're going to do it at a block basis. But you've heard us build markets for 15 years by electronifying them. So you're taking our nat gas options from 5% electronic to 25% of electronic over the last 18 months, that's why you're seeing this grow outside the market share in revenue-generating products like nat gas options and you'll see us continue to push that with the overall revenue story as well. So our revenue growth is up 21% in energy as a whole, -- ICE's revenue growth is up 14% in energy, and NASDAQ is in energy, I guess, either flat, maybe negative based on the incentives they're paying out."

It is another solid quarter for us. Average daily volume in Q2 rose by 13%, the same growth rate as our record first quarter.
We had double-digit growth again from each of our buy-side client groups, including asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, corporates and retail. Despite the recent slowdown and volatility post-Brexit as measured by the VIX, we are tracking up 10% compared with last July.
We were pleased to set an open interest record in the second quarter of over 116 million contracts, and we are near peaks in our large open interest holders data in several product areas. This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macroenvironment. We saw robust electronic trading activity outside of the U.S. with Asia up 21% versus Q2 last year, Latin America rose 16% and Europe rose 12%. Following the Brexit announcement, we had significant activity from outside of the U.S. with 5.3 million contracts traded from Europe and 1.9 million contracts traded from Asia the day after.
In Q2, the electronic volume from outside of the U.S. is 24%. In July, that has jumped to 27%; and the day after Brexit, 29% of the activity was outside of the U.S.
In Europe, volumes in five of our product areas grew by more than 20% with the strongest growth in energy and equities with year-to-date ADV up 38% and 35%, respectively.
In Asia, future ADV and energy rose by more than 140%, and metals volumes jumped more than 80%. Latin America growth was also led by energy. In addition to the country of origin information that we shared with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day.
In Q2, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 40% from 260,000 contracts per day last year to 360,000 this quarter. During European hours, from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Central Time, volume rose from 750,000 per day to 1.1 million a day, up almost 45%.
Turning to our efforts in options. We remain a leader relative to other global exchanges with Q2 options rising 15% and electronic options average daily volume rising 23% to 1.7 million contracts.
In Q2, the percentage of options that traded on Globex reached an all-time high of 57%, up from 51% in Q1. We saw the highest electronic percentage to date in interest rates, energy and metals. Agriculture options reached a record quarterly ADV of 345,000, up 26% from the prior year.
Lastly, in June, we had the highest month ever in total weekly options products with 495,000 contracts per day, up 57%.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had a very impressive quarter with energy, ag and metals, each up more than 20% in revenue. We also set new records of large open interest holders in metals and ag, reaffirming that global customers continue to manage their commodities markets' risk exposures at CME Group. We track substitute products very closely, and we have outperformed peers in crude futures, crude options, natural gas futures, natural gas options, gold and copper so far in 2016.
Energy was particularly strong with Q2 average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, and July has continued to be robust with volumes up 20%. In Q2, crude was up 38%, natural gas rose 17%, and refined products increased 18%.
The European and Asian activity in energy mentioned earlier highlights our extremely focused attention on our customers globally and the growing relevance of our product set.
Growth in energy options has been meaningful. WTI options volume rose more than 20% to more than 180,000 contracts per day, while natural gas options were up almost 20% as well.
Within energy options, we have grown from 49% electronic in Q1 to 53% in Q2 and up to 57% so far this month.
Energy ADV in the second quarter was the second highest quarter ever behind the record first quarter this year.
Our metals business during the quarter was phenomenal. Volume was up 41% and transaction revenues rose 35%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 43%, while copper rose 33% versus a year ago. Options activity was strong, up 32% compared to last year. Metals had a second best quarter ever, and we had outperformed substitute products at other exchanges by a significant amount. We were also able to achieve multiple all-time open interest records in copper as well as set the all-time records for large open interest holders in both gold and silver in July.
Last but not least, our agriculture business had its highest volume quarter in our history. Ag options rose 26% and futures were up 22%. Soybeans led the way, up 49%, while corn, soybean meal and Hard Red Winter Wheat each grew more than 20%. It is worth noting that they are increasing expectations of the likelihood of La Nina. We would expect that to impact both agricultural volumes as well as benefiting our natural gas markets.
Turning to financial products and starting with interest rates, average daily volume in Q2 was up 3% and year-to-date we are up 7%.
Within Eurodollar options, volume increased 28% during the second quarter. Recently, we have had progress developing liquidity and trading on the screen with the electronic percentage increasing from 23% to 25% from Q1 to Q2. Also, the electronic volume during the U.S. hours when the pits are open continues to increase significantly. Fed fund futures continued to be robust, as we have seen Fed expectations move around before, during and after the Brexit vote.
Fed funds futures averaged more than 142,000 contracts per day in Q2, up almost 140%. In addition, we spoke about the successful launch of the Ultra 10-Year product last quarter, and volume has jumped from 35,000 contracts per day to over 60,000 and July is tracking at that same level.
We launched options clearing in the second quarter with 5 approved clearing members, and we've now cleared dealer-to-dealer and customer trades. In addition to Swaptions, our recently launched Brazilian real IRS clearing offering began scaling in June and we now have 24 participants who have cleared the product thus far.
We continue to outperform other related markets indicating the proportion of activities shifting to our interest rate futures and options. For example, while we are up 7% year-to-date in interest rate volumes, global dealer-to-client swap clearing volumes were down 10% in the dollar fix to floating market. We continued to capture market share in treasuries, which we talked about before as cash treasuries are down 5%, while our treasury futures are flat. Our open interest in rates continues to hit record elevated levels above $63 million contracts in March and June, while rate related open interest at most of our exchanges peaked several years ago.
Turning to equities. ADV was up 25% in Q2 to almost 3 million contracts. And as I mentioned, we have had great participation from clients around the world. We had solid activity in equity options, which grew 24% during the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the record of more than 440,000 equity options that traded post-Brexit before the U.S. stock market even opened. 
In addition, last week, we announced the launch of S&P 500 Total Return Index futures and the S&P 500 Carry Adjusted Total Return Index futures. These innovative products are intended to mimic the economics of a total return swap in futures form, allowing swap dealers and their end clients to avoid higher costs as a result of new swap margin rules that are expected on September 1.
This is another example of CME Group's ongoing commitment to meet the changing needs of our clients in an evolving global marketplace. The S&P 500 Total Return Index futures will be available to trade by BTIC, which is Basis Trade Index at Close and will further expand the U.S. major index BTIC offering, which traded a record $32 billion in notional value during Q2. 
Lastly, our FX business was down 7% in Q2 as the trading environment was challenging pre-Brexit. So far this year, we have outperformed the 2 largest FX platforms in terms of trading activity versus last year. Our FX markets performed very well during the post-Brexit day when the markets were active and we had record British pound activity with more than 500,000 contracts traded that day.
Speaking of Brexit, we were very busy after the results came in, particularly during the pre-U.S. hours. We had a record 350 million messages to process. And as the slide in our presentation shows, we handled it without any issues. This is a tribute to our hard-working colleagues, who are ready to handle strong activity when volatility spiked.
We have had a tremendous opportunity during the last few months to deeply engage with our global clients as markets growth continued to evolve with uncertainty post-Brexit and also the upcoming implementation of margin for uncleared swaps. We have been talking to folks about the greater regulatory certainty under U.S. regulation. And based on the results again this quarter, it is clear customers at every continent are comfortable with the U.S. regime. This was further solidified with recognition and permanent QCCP status in Europe that we received in June.
The next potential catalyst for increased exchange trading and swaps clearing is in about 5 weeks when the first phase begins in the interdealer market requiring daily initial margin in variation region margin to be exchanged on a bilateral noncentrally cleared portfolios in the U.S..
There will be a 10-day margin period of risk that will be put in place for uncleared swaps, and there will be less netting available compared to the 5-day period for cleared swaps and generally 1 to 2 days for futures and options.
Based on many client discussions, we are accelerating internal product development to try to create solutions that can provide relief for participants, including intermediaries and end clients. I mentioned the S&P 500 Total Return Index futures launched prior to September 1. Within our interest rate and FX areas, we are examining multiple new product ideas and looking at product construction. Within FX, opportunities we are working on include clearing for OTC FX options and nondeliverable forwards. 
In addition, within rates, we believe this could be a catalyst for our Swaptions business, and they're getting inbound calls from customers about other ideas. Lastly, I mentioned repo clearing last quarter, and we continued to make significant progress on the operational side in terms of technology and clearing, and we are working closely with large banks, asset managers and hedge funds. In addition, we are planning to be operationally prepared to launch fairly soon after regulatory approval.
In summary, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. We have worked hard to position the company for success in the world that needs transparent, clear solutions for risk management now more than ever. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.As Gill mentione",922,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.
As Gill mentioned, we had another excellent quarter. Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter in Q2 last year with 4 of our 6 product areas delivering more than 20% revenue growth. Our adjusted expenses, excluding license fees were flat with the second quarter of last year, so almost all of the incremental revenue dropped to the operating income line. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 3 percentage points from a year ago and adjusted EPS was up more than 15% for the second quarter in a row.
This quarter, we removed amortization from our adjusted results, and we provided a summary of the impact on prior quarters both in our earnings presentation deck, as well as in the income statement trend file we posted on our website. This change puts the reporting of our adjusted results in line with our U.S. exchange peers.
Our rate per contract for the second quarter was $0.782, up from $0.756 in Q1 due primarily to a positive shift in product mix, which was slightly offset by the member-nonmember mix.
Market data revenue was $103 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. 
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense was $270 million, exactly where we were in Q2 2015, which I am pleased to report along with the solid top line growth. For the first half of the year, on this basis, we were at $534 million, up about 1/2 of 1%. For the second half, I would expect expenses to be about $548 million. The increase from the first half is based on our heavier spend on customer-related activity in Q4 and the acceleration of product development, which Gill alluded to. We will be lower than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, which included amortization and excluded license fees by $4 million.
Instead of being up 1%, we are guiding to 0.5% increase on that basis. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,640 employees, up 40 from last quarter, driven primarily by entry-level hires and hires in lower cost locations.
Our competition ratio from Q2 came in at 14.5% and is down from 17% in Q2 last year. Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $27 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, up slightly from Q1. 
Turning to investment income. We received $2.6 million in dividends from BB&F. In addition, our investment returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed funds contributions during Q2, decreased sequentially to $5.2 million from $7 million in Q1.
This is a result of lower average daily investment balances from the prior quarter and our net return during Q2 was 9 basis points. While we have been approved to establish an account with the Fed for house cash, it is not live yet, and we continue to work through the operational details.
Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at an adjusted 36.5%, which is where we guided. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.34 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the second quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $20 million, as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense.
We originally guided to $115 million to $120 million for the year. I'm going to reduce that by $15 million to $100 million to $105 million based on efficiency efforts and timing.
One final item I want to outline today is a new program we have available for equity members. These firms are required to hold shares of CME Group Class A common stock in addition to seats to receive equity membership privileges.
Under the terms of the program, participants may substitute the assignment of their required shares by paying us a monthly subscription. Currently, there are 370 institutions that are required to hold CME Group Class A common shares as part of their equity membership.
A typical equity member is required to hold 20,000 shares per exchange in addition to seats. For most of the equity members, the subscription rate will be $7500 per month per exchange. This will provide choice for the firms and potentially allow them to free up capital to deploy in other ways. Each of the 370 firms will have full discretion on whether or not to participate in the program. The timing under evaluation and decision to participate is expected to lead to an orderly share release over time and should be easily absorbed by the market. As it is unclear on the participation level, we will update you next quarter on the uptake.
At a 50% participation level, we would generate an estimated $20 million of incremental annual revenue and up to $40 million if all equity members switch to monthly subscription. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent, and since the first of the year, we have returned $1.4 billion in dividends. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.

In terms of the bottom line on these products, if you look at the TN as Gill mentioned, we were doing 60,000 contracts a day. So you can look at our rates RPC, which is publicly available, and you can see that we're running currently at several million dollars a year in terms of revenues, in terms of the run rate. If you look at Mexican pesos and our interest rate swaps clearing business, we now offer 19 currencies relative to the large competitor offering 17 currencies. So we got 2 now unique value propositions in terms of currencies, both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. In terms of the Mexican peso, we have MXN 1.5 million a month is our current run rate. So while it is a small currency, it's actually having a significant impact on that business. If you look at the Brazilian real, as Gill mentioned on the call, we're hitting a critical mass in the month of June. To put in perspective, we launched -- it takes time for the new products to gain traction relative to building a critical mass of participants. In the month of June, we had a $5 billion equivalent. Total volume cleared in the month of July -- sorry, that was in the month of May. Excuse me, $5 billion in the month of May. In the month of June, we had $35 billion. The Brazilian real against unique value proposition relative to our largest competitor, it is a larger currency than Mexican peso, so we do expect eventually to make more in the Brazilian real than we are currently making in the Mexican peso. We had a big success in our equity products that were launched in November of last year. The dividend futures, which we've spoken about are running about 1,000 day. The bigger and more exciting thing relative to future growth is we've got over 50,000 contracts in open interest. In terms of BTIC, we're trading that's on the S&P 500 in particular. We're trading over 5,000 contracts a day. If you look at new products, we hope that they drive typically 3-or-so percent of our top line growth. We have other new products that we're launching with Swaptions. As I said, it takes a while to build a critical mass. With the Brazilian real, it took us from August of last year until June of this year to start hitting a critical mass. We do expect with U.S. dollar swaptions to hit a critical mass hopefully in the fourth quarter and to begin to see significant growth starting then. So we see strong growth across each of our product areas with top line of 3% plus. Derek, do you want to jump in?"

And that's the way to think about product developments and opportunities is where there are global benchmarks that might be in this repair or broken benchmarks. Clients not able to manage a risk the way they could. Those are market entry opportunities for us. For example, our move into aluminum 18 months ago was a result of customers not being able to access their physical aluminum and get it out of their warehouses. So the growth in market share and revenue generation on our copper business has been largely helped by our entering the aluminum market. In fact, MillerCoors announced just last month that they're going to be shifting their price benchmark for the North American aluminum procurement to a CME-based product that we launched 18 months ago. Looking forward, the other area of product opportunity and development, is where we can add products to our overall portfolio. So as Gill mentioned, we've hit record revenue generation in our agriculture products business. We announced last month that we'll be launching our European wheat contracts on September 12 of this year and that fills out what is already a globally utilized contract with a product that addresses some of the shortcomings in the current products. So great opportunities there and where it fits into our portfolio of services, making it easier from a capital perspective and operational asset perspective for our customers to manage all the risk at CME Group. That's been our focal point for product development."

If you look at the energy revenues we generated year-to-date, energy revenues is now representing almost 35% of the total revenues we're generating out of China and greater China as a whole. Our business in greater China, meaning Hong Kong, China and Taiwan is up 227%. The metals business, specifically, is our second biggest revenue source in the same region and that's up 61%. So the opportunities that we've got when we own the COMEX benchmarks from the metal side, our ability to position ourselves as a global benchmark in region with the sales efforts that Brian and his team has been putting forth in region to make sure that we're accessing a customer base with global liquidity by time zone as well, that's how we see the opportunity continue to build into that community. I would also like to add that if you look at the importance of the commercial customers to our commodities complex as a whole, we've continued to focus on them being is the primary driver of our access, because as you address those end-user customer needs, that brings the other market participants, the profit to banks, the others that want to be where the end-user customers are. So whether you look at the revenue growth of the franchise as a whole, the record level of large open interest holders, the record level open interest itself layered on top of the China growth, tells a story of globalized participation in our markets and globalizing access to those global participant based on the commercial side."

I think that we've been building our market share in Brent and really building our global participation in Brent. And when you build markets and you enter where the incumbent is already present, you need to answer by providing incentives to make it easy to access and where you don't make it too economically painful. So what we've done is over the last probably 24 months or so, we've looked at the traction we've gotten, 10%, 12%, 13%, and we've now actually rolled out our Brent options market as well last quarter. And we're at a point now where we said we think we've got a sustainable participation level across the franchise as a whole. Energy is up 25%. We've always said Brent is an important part of the overall story. The market is telling us it wants to trade WTI, and we look at the differential fortunes between what's happening between -- what happens on the WTI side of the fence where our business is up about 45%, 48% and ICE's Brent is up about 19%. The market is telling you it wants to trade on the WTI side of the ledger. So we've been successful with the commercial participation. And we believe at this point, we're happy to be able to start to scale back some of those incentives that the liquidity itself is sufficient to be able to maintain participation in the market. So in any type of market maker incentive is in place, they're always by nature temporary. if you're successful at the value proposition, that will hold once you remove the incentives. I think the overall performance of the franchise speaks to the success and the value we're bringing to the commercial participants."

We're seeing the significant growth uptake on the WTI side of the ledger. We're also seeing significant growth in the electronic side of our business. So when you couple together the huge growth that we're seeing in the core franchise, we're seeing the large open interest holder record levels, we're seeing commercial participation and revenue generation from the commercial participants at record level. We actually find that our business as a whole is beyond just any particular single product size. But when you talk about individual views on the nat gas itself, but our nat gas franchise year-to-date is up 12% and ICE's revenue was actually down 4% in nat gas. And but when you go to a pre-FX launch, we're about 65% of the nat gas options market. NASDAQ is about 35%. If you look at the rolling 60-day average, we've actually increased our market share since NFX was launched, we're 68%, ICE is 20%, NFX is about 12%. So when you actually look at in a 2-man race, we're 65% of the market, in a 3-man race, we're 68% of the market, that's a bigger market. So when we talk to our customers, what's important to them is the full range of products and services inside the asset class. So we think about the 76% market share we have in the nat gas futures. The growing percentage market share, which we're getting paid by our customers to deliver on top of the fact that the overall franchise and TI, and we talked about the footprint we've generated in China right now, that's what our customers want access to. They want to access the global prices, they want to access to a product where you have global participation from the commercial side and international footprint side, and where we are in a process of electronifying the nat gas options, business because that's what makes you sticky. I want to remind everybody that when you look at the NFX value prop, they said, we're going to do it free, and we're going to do it at a block basis. But you've heard us build markets for 15 years by electronifying them. So you're taking our nat gas options from 5% electronic to 25% of electronic over the last 18 months, that's why you're seeing this grow outside the market share in revenue-generating products like nat gas options and you'll see us continue to push that with the overall revenue story as well. So our revenue growth is up 21% in energy as a whole, -- ICE's revenue growth is up 14% in energy, and NASDAQ is in energy, I guess, either flat, maybe negative based on the incentives they're paying out."

We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry leading options, and futures franchise and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our volume is up 8%, as is our transactions revenue, while earnings per share is up more than 10%. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, then I will shift to a few product highlights. 
We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last 5 years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grew in the low single digits, while the U.S. activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We also saw noticeable performance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. In addition to the country of origin information that we've shared with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The U.S. trading hours volume is down 1% because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.
Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. 
We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to date with more than 57% and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increased adoption of Globex's execution for complex options spread. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all option spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012. We've continued to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year treasury contract reached 73,000 contracts per day compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open interest continues to build, and the bid offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on 1 day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to Taylor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 total return index futures, and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some cleared FX products like MDX and options and potential new future contracts, primarily in interest rate, equity and FX.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. 
We had another strong quarter led by metals and energy, up 22% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities asset classes. We reached an all-time high this month in a number of large open interest holders in energy, while ag and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remained near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continued to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.
Our metals business has been our fastest-growing segment this year, with volumes up 29% to date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading day. And in our industrial metals area, we continued to build on our success with our copper business, up 17% year-to-date, compared to copper business, which is down 7%. We also continued to grow our copper open interest, with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our metals business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.
Energy was particularly strong. In Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%, natural gas rose 23% and refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success, with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume.
Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single day volume record, as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago. We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the U.S. now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well-positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically set of Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark energy products in our global customer growth, with energy business in Asia up 104% in September.
Turning to financial products. 
And starting with interest rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date, we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September of about 55 million contracts was up 15%, with Eurodollars up 17% and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our is [indiscernible] watch 2 is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open interest in the first 4 quarterly Eurodollars futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts, which is a 4-year high.
Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date Fed funds futures average daily volume is up 70% to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to date and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year to more than 80%. Over-the-counter swaps revenue approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September, with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and has compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.
Turning to equities. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12%, but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the S&P futures that we trade compared to these spider ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was 7x that of the spider. This year, in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10x higher. When you think about the all-in costs to trade based on a tight bid offer spread and deep liquidity, we are considerably less expensive.
Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.
In summary, through the hard work of our staff, we continued to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,383905703,1062909,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset class",868,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August of 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility, by definition, does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I am pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through 3 quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share.
Our adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%.
Our rate for contract for the third quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a number of nonmembership in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower price natural gas options, which created a negative venue shift.
Moving to expenses. 
Excluding licensee fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to the last year. And the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our non-compensation related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was the highest level we have ever achieved.
Turning to investment income. 
We received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&F Bovespa. In addition, our investment returns generated through the re-investment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. 
Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided. 
And now to the balance sheet. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&F Bovespa stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast maturity of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend. We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come. 
During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continued to leverage more softer and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center. 
Last quarter, I mentioned a subscription program that we made available for our members. We continued to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take up so far has been relatively small. We booked about $170,000 in Q3. And with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per ear of new revenue.
We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long-term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes which reduces the overall costs to trade on our markets as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes in open interest
[Audio Gap]
On our plans next quarter. Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance, excluding license fees for the second half of 2016, down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter from marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth-oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis. 
In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continued to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent. And since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And I know going into '17, it's early, but when we think about that you guys have said kind of longer-term in like the low single digit expense growth, just any color that you can give on how much of that is like volume oriented.

When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into 3 categories.

There are some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior-year, is seasonably higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year and we decided not to adjust our guidance. When you take a look at next year, we'll update everybody in the fourth quarter's conference call. But we did say that we'd be between in the low and mid single digits, with the high year end of the mid-single digits being due to a higher revenue achievements. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017."

I think that this is one of those topics that I've heard forever since I've been here in the last 35, 36 years. People have said, and I've actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency, and they also prevail in the Senate and the House, and control all 3 branches of the government, that it will be easier to pass a transaction tax. Well, I would say, what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario when President Barack Obama became elected, and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do everything. We work really hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they would be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity, for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging like Mr. has referenced. And if those spreads widen, I've testified many times now, you put forward the transaction tax of a couple of hundred million dollars. Let me show you how the cost to consumer several billion dollars by doing so. So I think like we professionally and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax. But at the same time, taxes are going to public to continue to go up in some way, shape or form, I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes, but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, they are losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products where people hold for a period of a lot longer, and they have a much larger universe of participants. When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a small group of people, as I said earlier and I just can't see even how our government would look at that. And that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates -- so we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And in fact, the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going to be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic senator understands that."

On the increased margin rules, September 1 was the date U.S., Japan and Canada implemented them. The CFTC had a no action relief until October 3. The biggest impact, according to the reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there that we think could help relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings, we currently have 7 clearing members who have been approved by the Risk Committee, 2 new clearing members in the last couple of months. And we were excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared marginal requirements in the rates area. Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF marked offering out here. We also clear our cash settle forwards. But in addition to that, we've began working very hard on OTC FX options clearing. And we believe the combination of all of those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We're working very closely with a set of marketing participants on that. In terms of equities, equities, according to BIS reports, kind of third after those of classes in terms of the impacts on the marketplace. We launched on our August, late August, a total return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of our total return swaps, so the OTC equity swaps market. With the no actual relief until October 3, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3rd, but that week immediately with several participants trade in that first week, about 3,500 contracts. So you're talking about $3.5 billion approximately, and they traded in blocks of about $500 million each. So you have very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total return futures. In terms of the next 4 years, it's only the top 20 or 21[ph] institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next 4 years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms, so we do expect to relative to our focus on it, relative to new products and services that we're offering, that will -- there will be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the new cleared products, as well as the new -- as well as for futures products."

And it's a number of factors that we are controlling for in terms of our ability to both roll out product, acquire new customers, position our benchmark product, and what is a market that is shifting structurally in favor of our benchmark products that whether you look at the -- lifting the export ban in crude back in December of 2015, creating a water balloon product that is WTI, we now have a product that the market is increasingly adopting as a global benchmark. As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we're leveraging. Bryan and the teams on the ground in here and in Asia to go access and bring new customers on board. And when you actually think about the energies complex as a whole, we're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So I we talk about the overall franchise on Slide 9 of the deck that we sent to you guys, in the same structural shifts we talked about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On Slide 9, on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry hub products between the prices both in Asia and Germany. When you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market, and that's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we are excited about, as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part we launched will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally. Also, the open interest levels, over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels for open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time hires in our large open interest holders on the futures side. And on the options, as we talked about previously, record levels of electronification and nat gas options and continued growth our nat gas options business level over 30% this year."

We've done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the the order book. The downside of that is you end up getting up our block surcharge when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central order books. So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen, so we're finding that great deal of success, moving from less than 10% electronic to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September, so it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we have undertaken in other markets as we globalize and electronify them and with the business up[ph] 31%, typically, you also start to move through volume tiers as well.

And our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value in revenues from our assets. So for example in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and non-trading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing scheme does not fully capture the value Alex described to these different user segments. And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities and there is a significant pipeline of demand for our data IP as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase. Now this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly and going after those opportunities on a derived basis. I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform which we just recently introduced in conjunction with , so the usable data needs to be instantly accessible, and we've done that with our recent introduction of tech fault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously. So this is making data access easily, easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing, so we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we're really looking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective."

Also, we think it's beneficial for new members coming in, especially those from overseas, that we're holding CME stock, and having that amount of capital is prohibitive. So that takes time to work through the system. So in terms of the overall opportunity being about $40 million, we're at roughly 10% of that and it's only been out for just a couple of months.

We have I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% of the retail trade globally. And that if we could just double that, you can imagine what the revenue could do for this company. So we are taking a strong look at that. I think what's important is, here, we're not targeting the mom and pops on a street. When we call retail, we're talking about participants in the market every trading anywhere from 10 to 20 contracts a day already, and we're trying to harness that into the business. What I think is also fascinating is when you look at these discount retail equity brokers traditionally, they're starting to merge together the ones that offer futures. So that only bodes well for us to concentrate us more, people that are already offering us products."

We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise, and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our volume is up 8%as is our transactions revenue, while earnings per share is up more than 10%. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, then I will shift to a few product highlights. 
We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last 5 years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grew in the low single digits, while the U.S. activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We also saw noticeable outperformance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. 
In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The U.S. trading hours volume was down 1% because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.
Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to-date with more than 57% and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increased adoption of Globex execution for complex options spreads. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all options spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012. 
We continue to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year treasury contract reached 73,000 contracts per day compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open interest continues to build, and the bid/offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on 1 day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to tailor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 Total Return Index Futures, and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some cleared FX products like NDFs and Options and potential new futures contracts, primarily in interest rate, equity and FX.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had another strong quarter led by metals and energy, up 22% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities asset classes. We reach an all-time high this month in the number of large open interest holders in energy, while ags and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remain near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.
Our Metals business has been our fastest-growing segment this year with volumes up 29% to-date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our Metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading days. And in our industrial metals area, we continued to build on our success in our copper business, up 17% year-to-date compared to LME's copper business, which is down 7%. We also continued to grow our Copper Open Interest with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our Metals business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.
Energy was particularly strong. In Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%. Natural gas rose 23%. And refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume.
Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single-day volume record as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago. We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the U.S. now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically settled Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark Energy products in our global customer growth with Energy business in Asia up 104% in September.
Turning to financial products and starting with Interest Rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date, we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September of about 55 million contracts was up 15% with Eurodollars up 17% and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our Fedwatch tool is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open interest in the first 4 quarterly Eurodollars futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts, which is a 4-year high.
Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date fed funds futures average daily volume is up 70% to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to-date and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year to more than 80%. 
Over-the-counter swaps revenue approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and have compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.
Turning to equities. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12% but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the E-mini S&P futures that we trade compared to these SPDR ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was 7x that of the SPDR. This year in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10x higher. When you think about the all-in cost to trade based on a tight bid/offer spread and deep liquidity, we are considerably less expensive.
Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.
In summary, through the hard work of our staff, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset class",919,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August in 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility, by definition, does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I am pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through 3 quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share.
Our adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%.
Our rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a member/nonmember shift in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower priced natural gas options, which created a negative venue shift.
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million, and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to last year. And the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our noncompensation-related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was the highest level we have ever achieved.
Turning to investment income. We received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&FBOVESPA. In addition, our investment returns, generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions, increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. 
Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&FBOVESPA stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast maturity of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend. We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come. 
During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continue to leverage more software- and infrastructure-as-a-service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center. 
Last quarter, I mentioned the subscription program that we made available for our members. We continue to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take-up so far has been relatively small. We booked about $170,000 in Q3. And with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per year of new revenue.
We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long-term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes which reduces the overall costs to trade on our markets as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes and open interest and an expanding number of global participants, the value to our customers from transacting in
Our markets has never been greater. 
We remain focused on being as efficient as possible. We have been reducing the core operating costs to free up expense dollars to deploy on growth
Initiatives. We are currently working on our 2017 budget and will report out on our plans next quarter. 
Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance, excluding license fees, for the second half of 2016 down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter for marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth-oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis. 
In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million, and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent. And since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And I know going into '17, it's early, but when we think about what you guys have said kind of longer term in like the low single-digit expense growth, just any color that you can give on how much of that is like volume oriented.

When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into 3 categories. One is compensation, which, similar to this quarter last year, included our annual adjustments to the estimates associated with stock-based compensation, which will cause an increase quarter-over-quarter -- or I mean, sorry, quarterly sequentially, an increase in the fourth quarter. There's some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior years is seasonably higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer-facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year, and we decided not to adjust our guidance. When you take a look at next year, we'll update everybody in the fourth quarter's conference call. But we did say that we'd be between the low and mid single digits with the higher end of the mid-single digits being due to higher revenue achievement. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017."

I think that this is one of those topics that I've heard forever since I've been here in the last 35, 36 years. People have said, and I've actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency, and they also prevail in the Senate and the House and control all 3 branches of the government that it would be easier to pass a transaction tax. Well, I would say, what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario when President Barack Obama became elected and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do anything. We work very hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they'd be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging, all the asset classes that Mr. Gill just referenced. And if those spreads widen, I've testified many times how you put forward the transaction tax of a couple hundred million dollars, let me show you how it cost the consumer several billion dollars by doing so. So I think as long as we act professional and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax. But at the same time, taxes are going to probably continue to go up in some way, shape or form. I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that, around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, they're losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products, which people hold for a period of a lot longer, and they have a much larger universe of participants. When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a very small group of people, as I said earlier, and I just can't see even how our government would look at that. And that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates -- listen, we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And if in fact, the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going to be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic side of the aisle understands that."

On the uncleared margin rules, September 1 was the date U.S., Japan and Canada implemented them. The CFTC had no-action relief until October 3. The biggest impact, according to the BIS reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there that we think could help relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings, we currently have 7 clearing members who have been approved by the Risk Committee, 2 new clearing members in the last couple of months. And we're excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared margin requirements in the rates area. Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF mark offering out here. We also clear cash settle forwards. But in addition to that, we've began working very hard on OTC FX options clearing. And we believe the combination of all those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We're working very closely with a set of market participants on that. In terms of equities, equities, according to BIS reports, kind of third after those other tranche of [ph] classes in terms of the impacts on the marketplace. We launched on our August, late August, a total return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of a total return swap, so the OTC equity swaps market. With the no-action relief until October 3, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3rd, but that week, immediately, with several participants trade in their first week, about 3,500 contracts -- so you're talking about $3.5 billion, approximately, and they traded in blocks of about $500 million each. So you have very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total return futures. In terms of the next 4 years, it's only the top 20 or 21 [ph] institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next 4 years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms, so we do expect it -- relative to our focus on it, relative to new products and services that we're offering, that will -- there'll be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the new cleared products as well as the new -- as well as our futures products."

As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we're leveraging. Bryan's team's on the ground in Europe and in Asia to go access and bring new customers on board. And we actually think about the energies complex as a whole. We're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So as we talk about the overall franchise on Slide 9 of the deck that we sent you guys, in the same structural shifts we talk about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over Brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On Slide 9, on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry Hub products between the prices both in Asia and Germany. And you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market, and that's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we're excited about, as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part that we launch will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally. Also, the open interest levels, over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels for open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time highs [ph] in our large open interest holders on the futures side.

On the nat gas side, as John mentioned, there's 2 things going on. Number one, you've seen us build into sustainable growth in options markets by making sure that we can build those markets electronically, so we can market that liquidity globally. We faced the market structure in nat gas options a year ago that was 95% brokered, less than 5% traded on screen. So every time we shifted businesses from a brokered market on to the screen, we've done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the central limit order book. The downside of that is you end up giving up our block surcharge when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central limit order book. So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen, so we're finding that great deal of success, moving from less than 10% electronic to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September, so it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we've undertaken in other markets as we globalize and electronify them and with the business up 31%, typically, you also start to move through volume tiers as well. So we consider this a first world problem relative to volumes growth and a disciplined move on to a central limit order book."

It's Bryan. First of all, just to give you a little color, since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver's been in full effect now for almost a year, where in all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscriber fee revenues and our subscribers remain stable. Now as we continued to advance our market data and IP growth opportunities, we've been performing a holistic assessment of our current program. And our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value in revenues from our assets. So for example in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and nontrading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing scheme does not fully capture the value Alex described to these different user segments. And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities, and there is a significant pipeline of demand per our data IP as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase. Now this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly and going after those opportunities on a derived basis. I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform which we just recently introduced in conjunction with TickSmith. The usable data needs to be instantly accessible, and we've done that with our recent introduction of TickVault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously. So this is making data access easily -- easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing, so we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we're relooking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective."

We have, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% of the retail trade globally. And that if we could just double that, you can imagine what the revenue could do for this company. So we are taking a strong look at that. I think what's important is, here, we're not targeting the mom and pops on the street. When we call retail, we're talking about participants that are in the market today trading anywhere from 10 to 20 contracts a day already, and we're trying to harness that into the business. What I think is also fascinating is when you look at some of these discount retail equity brokers traditionally, they're starting to merge together the ones that offer futures. So that only bodes well for us to concentrate this more among people that are already offering these products."

We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise, and solving challenges our customers face through a number of",1342,"Thank you, Mr. Peschier, and thank you all for joining us. 
We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise, and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our volume is up 8% as is our transactions revenue, while earnings per share is up more than 10%. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, then I will shift to a few product highlights. 
We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last 5 years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grow in the low single digits, while the U.S. activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We also saw noticeable outperformance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. 
In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The U.S. trading hours volume was down 1% because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.
Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to-date with more than 57% and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increased adoption of Globex execution for complex options spreads. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all options spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012. 
We continue to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year treasury contract reached 73,000 contracts per day compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open interest continues to build, and the bid/offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on 1 day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to tailor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 Total Return Index Futures, and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some cleared FX products like NDFs and Options and potential new futures contracts, primarily in interest rates, equity and FX.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had another strong quarter led by metals and energy, up 22% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities asset classes. We reached an all-time high this month in the number of large open interest holders in energy, while ags and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remain near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.
Our Metals business has been our fastest-growing segment this year with volumes up 29% to-date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our Metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading days. And in our industrial metals area, we continued to build on our success in our copper business, up 17% year-to-date compared to LME's copper business, which is down 7%. We also continue to grow our Copper Open Interest with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our Metals business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.
Energy was particularly strong. In Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%. Natural gas rose 23%. And refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume.
Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single-day volume record as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago. We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the U.S. now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically settled Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark Energy products in our global customer growth with Energy business in Asia up 104% in September.
Turning to financial products and starting with Interest Rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date, we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September of about 55 million contracts was up 15% with Eurodollars up 17% and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our Fedwatch tool is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open interest in the first 4 quarterly Eurodollars futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts, which is a 4-year high.
Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date fed funds futures average daily volume is up 70% to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to-date and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year to more than 80%. 
Over-the-counter swaps revenue approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and have compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.
Turning to equities. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12% but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the E-mini S&P futures that we trade compared to the SPDR ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was 7x that of the SPDR. This year in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10x higher. When you think about the all-in cost to trade based on a tight bid/offer spread and deep liquidity, we are considerably less expensive.
Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.

2004577,383905703,1063965,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset class",919,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August in 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility, by definition, does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I am pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through 3 quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share.
Our adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%.
Our rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a member/nonmember shift in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower priced natural gas options, which created a negative venue shift.
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million, and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to last year. And the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our noncompensation-related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was the highest level we have ever achieved.
Turning to investment income. We received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&FBOVESPA. In addition, our investment returns, generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions, increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. 
Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&FBOVESPA stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast majority of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend. We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come. 
During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continue to leverage more software- and infrastructure-as-a-service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center. 
Last quarter, I mentioned the subscription program that we made available for our members. We continue to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take-up so far has been relatively small. We booked about $170,000 in Q3. And with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per year of new revenue.
We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long-term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes which reduces the overall costs to trade on our markets as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes and open interest and an expanding number of global participants, the value to our customers from transacting in our markets has never been greater. 
We remain focused on being as efficient as possible. We have been reducing the core operating costs to free up expense dollars to deploy on growth initiatives. We are currently working on our 2017 budget and will report out on our plans next quarter. 
Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance, excluding license fees, for the second half of 2016 down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter for marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth-oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis. 
In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million, and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent. And since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And I know going into '17, it's early, but when we think about what you guys have said kind of longer term in like the low single-digit expense growth, just any color that you can give on how much of that is like volume oriented. And so if revenues are strong, you'll be at the top end of the range versus the bottom. And I know it's still early, but any color there."

When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into 3 categories. One is compensation, which, similar to this quarter last year, included our annual adjustments to the estimates associated with stock-based compensation, which will cause an increase quarter-over-quarter -- or I mean, sorry, quarterly sequentially, an increase in the fourth quarter. There's some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior years is seasonably higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer-facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year, and we decided not to adjust our guidance. When you take a look at next year, we'll update everybody in the fourth quarter's conference call. But we did say that we'd be between the low and mid-single digits with the higher end of the mid-single digits being due to higher revenue achievement. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017."

I think that this is one of those topics that I've heard forever since I've been here in the last 35, 36 years. People have said, and I've actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency, and they also prevail in the Senate and the House and control all 3 branches of the government that it would be easier to pass a transaction tax. Well, I would say, what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario when President Barack Obama became elected and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do anything. We work very hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they'd be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging, all the asset classes that Mr. Gill just referenced. And if those spreads widen, I've testified many times how you put forward the transaction tax of a couple hundred million dollars, let me show you how it costs the consumer several billion dollars by doing so. So I think as long as we act professional and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax. But at the same time, taxes are going to probably continue to go up in some way, shape or form. I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that, around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, they're losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products, which people hold for a period of a lot longer, and they have a much larger universe of participants. When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a very small group of people, as I said earlier, and I just can't see even how our government would look at that. And that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates -- listen, we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And if in fact, the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going to be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic side of the aisle understands that."

On the uncleared margin rules, September 1 was the date U.S., Japan and Canada implemented them. The CFTC had no-action relief until October 3. The biggest impact, according to the BIS reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there that we think could help relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings, we currently have 7 clearing members who have been approved by the Risk Committee, 2 new clearing members in the last couple of months. And we're excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared margin requirements in the rates area. Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF mark offering out here. We also clear cash settle forwards. But in addition to that, we've began working very hard on OTC FX options clearing. And we believe the combination of all those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We're working very closely with a set of market participants on that. In terms of equities, equities, according to BIS reports, kind of third after those other asset classes in terms of the impacts on the marketplace. We launched on our August, late August, a total return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of a total return swap, so the OTC equity swaps market. With the no-action relief until October 3, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3rd, but that week, immediately, with several participants trade in that first week, about 3,500 contracts -- so you're talking about $3.5 billion, approximately, and they traded in blocks of about $500 million each. So you have very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total return futures. In terms of the next 4 years, it's only the top 20 or 21 [ph] institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next 4 years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms, so we do expect it -- relative to our focus on it, relative to new products and services that we're offering, that will -- there'll be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the new cleared products as well as the new -- as well as with futures products."

And the mutualization of risk across clearing mechanisms is part of the reason why clearing-house mechanism works so effectively. And turning too much of that to the contribution of the CCP upfront could change the dynamics of the risk mechanisms that support a good default management. So the moral hazard is very real and shows up in multiple ways in the process."

We're actually very excited about the growth rates that we've been able to unlock in our energy complex. And it's a number of factors both -- that we are controlling for in terms of our ability to both roll out product, acquire new customers, position our benchmark product in what is a market that is shifting structurally in favor of our benchmark products that whether you look at the -- lifting the export ban in crude back in December of 2015, creating a water balloon product that is WTI, we now have a product that the market is increasingly adopting as a global benchmark. As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we're leveraging. Bryan's team's on the ground in Europe and in Asia to go access and bring new customers on board. And we actually think about the energies complex as a whole. We're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So as we talk about the overall franchise on Slide 9 of the deck that we sent you guys, in the same structural shifts we talk about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over Brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On Slide 9, on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry Hub products between the prices both in Asia and Germany. And you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market, and that's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we're excited about, as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part that we launch will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally. Also, the open interest levels, over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels for open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time highs in our large open interest holders on the futures side. And on the options, as we talked about previously, record levels of electronification and nat gas options and continued growth. Our nat gas options business at over 30% this year."

When you look at what the other offerings are out there, this is a market that's typically been brokered, and we're the ones that have gone from less than 10% of electronic in nat gas options to a record of over 40%, as Gill mentioned at the top of the call. And as you've seen us do across products over time, when you focus on functionality in electronic access to your options market, bringing people into the transparent central order book, we tend to see the velocity of transactions increase, and more important, we can access a global customer base. That's really hard to do in a block market. So we're excited about the progress we've made, the large open interest holder record levels that we're touching on is really a reflection of the increased global adoption of our product set, so we're excited about the multiple records we've hit in nat gas options, ADV, single-day record, large open interest holders, as well as the deferred month liquidity that we have built and focused on over the last 12 months as well.

On the nat gas side, as John mentioned, there's 2 things going on. Number one, you've seen us build into sustainable growth in options markets by making sure that we can build those markets electronically, so we can market that liquidity globally. We faced the market structure in nat gas options a year ago that was 95% brokered, less than 5% traded on screen. So every time we shifted businesses from a brokered market on to the screen, we've done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the central limit order book. The downside of that is you end up giving up our block surcharge when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central limit order book. So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen, so we're finding that great deal of success, moving from less than 10% electronic to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September, so it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we've undertaken in other markets as we globalize and electronify them and with the business up 31%, typically, you also start to move through volume tiers as well. So we consider this a first world problem relative to volumes growth and a disciplined move on to a central limit order book."

It's Bryan. First of all, just to give you a little color, since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver's been in full effect now for almost a year, where in all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscriber fee revenues and our subscribers remain stable. Now as we continued to advance our market data and IP growth opportunities, we've been performing a holistic assessment of our current program. And our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value in revenues from our assets. So for example in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and nontrading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing scheme does not fully capture the value, Alex, described to these different user segments. And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities, and there is a significant pipeline of demand per our data IP as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase. Now this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly and going after those opportunities on a derived basis. I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform which we just recently introduced in conjunction with TickSmith. The usable data needs to be instantly accessible, and we've done that with our recent introduction of TickVault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously. So this is making data access easily -- easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing, so we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we're relooking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective."

Also, we think it's beneficial for new members coming in, especially those from overseas, that we're holding CME stock, and having that amount of capital is prohibitive.

We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise, and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our volume is up 8% as is our transactions revenue, while earnings per share is up more than 10%. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, then I will shift to a few product highlights. 
We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last 5 years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grow in the low single digits, while the U.S. activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We also saw noticeable outperformance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. 
In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The U.S. trading hours volume was down 1% because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.
Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to-date with more than 57% and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increased adoption of Globex execution for complex options spreads. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all options spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012. 
We continue to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year treasury contract reached 73,000 contracts per day compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open interest continues to build, and the bid/offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on 1 day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to tailor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 Total Return Index Futures, and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some cleared FX products like NDFs and Options and potential new futures contracts, primarily in interest rates, equity and FX.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had another strong quarter led by metals and energy, up 22% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities asset classes. We reached an all-time high this month in the number of large open interest holders in energy, while ags and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remain near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.
Our Metals business has been our fastest-growing segment this year with volumes up 29% to-date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our Metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading days. And in our industrial metals area, we continued to build on our success in our copper business, up 17% year-to-date compared to LME's copper business, which is down 7%. We also continue to grow our Copper Open Interest with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our Metals business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.
Energy was particularly strong. In Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%. Natural gas rose 23%. And refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume.
Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single-day volume record as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago. We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the U.S. now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically settled Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark Energy products in our global customer growth with Energy business in Asia up 104% in September.
Turning to financial products and starting with Interest Rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date, we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September of about 55 million contracts was up 15% with Eurodollars up 17% and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our Fedwatch tool is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open interest in the first 4 quarterly Eurodollars futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts, which is a 4-year high.
Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date fed funds futures average daily volume is up 70% to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to-date and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year to more than 80%. 
Over-the-counter swaps revenue approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and have compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.
Turning to equities. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12% but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the E-mini S&P futures that we trade compared to the SPDR ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was 7x that of the SPDR. This year in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10x higher. When you think about the all-in cost to trade based on a tight bid/offer spread and deep liquidity, we are considerably less expensive.
Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.
In summary, through the hard work of our staff, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,383905703,1064662,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset class",919,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August in 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility, by definition, does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I am pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through 3 quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share.
Our adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%.
Our rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a member/nonmember shift in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower priced natural gas options, which created a negative venue shift.
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million, and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to last year. And the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our noncompensation-related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was the highest level we have ever achieved.
Turning to investment income. We received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&FBOVESPA. In addition, our investment returns, generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions, increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. 
Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&FBOVESPA stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast majority of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend. We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come. 
During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continue to leverage more software- and infrastructure-as-a-service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center. 
Last quarter, I mentioned the subscription program that we made available for our members. We continue to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take-up so far has been relatively small. We booked about $170,000 in Q3. And with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per year of new revenue.
We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long-term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes which reduces the overall costs to trade on our markets as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes and open interest and an expanding number of global participants, the value to our customers from transacting in our markets has never been greater. 
We remain focused on being as efficient as possible. We have been reducing the core operating costs to free up expense dollars to deploy on growth initiatives. We are currently working on our 2017 budget and will report out on our plans next quarter. 
Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance, excluding license fees, for the second half of 2016 down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter for marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth-oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis. 
In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million, and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent. And since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And I know going into '17, it's early, but when we think about what you guys have said kind of longer term in like the low single-digit expense growth, just any color that you can give on how much of that is like volume oriented. And so if revenues are strong, you'll be at the top end of the range versus the bottom. And I know it's still early, but any color there."

When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into 3 categories. One is compensation, which, similar to this quarter last year, included our annual adjustments to the estimates associated with stock-based compensation, which will cause an increase quarter-over-quarter -- or I mean, sorry, quarterly sequentially, an increase in the fourth quarter. There's some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior years is seasonably higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer-facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year, and we decided not to adjust our guidance. When you take a look at next year, we'll update everybody in the fourth quarter's conference call. But we did say that we'd be between the low and mid-single digits with the higher end of the mid-single digits being due to higher revenue achievement. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017."

I think that this is one of those topics that I've heard forever since I've been here in the last 35, 36 years. People have said, and I've actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency, and they also prevail in the Senate and the House and control all 3 branches of the government that it would be easier to pass a transaction tax. Well, I would say, what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario when President Barack Obama became elected and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do anything. We work very hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they'd be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging, all the asset classes that Mr. Gill just referenced. And if those spreads widen, I've testified many times how you put forward the transaction tax of a couple hundred million dollars, let me show you how it costs the consumer several billion dollars by doing so. So I think as long as we act professional and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax. But at the same time, taxes are going to probably continue to go up in some way, shape or form. I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that, around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, they're losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products, which people hold for a period of a lot longer, and they have a much larger universe of participants. When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a very small group of people, as I said earlier, and I just can't see even how our government would look at that. And that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates -- listen, we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And if in fact, the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going to be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic side of the aisle understands that."

On the uncleared margin rules, September 1 was the date U.S., Japan and Canada implemented them. The CFTC had no-action relief until October 3. The biggest impact, according to the BIS reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there that we think could help relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings, we currently have 7 clearing members who have been approved by the Risk Committee, 2 new clearing members in the last couple of months. And we're excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared margin requirements in the rates area. Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF mark offering out here. We also clear cash settle forwards. But in addition to that, we've began working very hard on OTC FX options clearing. And we believe the combination of all those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We're working very closely with a set of market participants on that. In terms of equities, equities, according to BIS reports, kind of third after those other asset classes in terms of the impacts on the marketplace. We launched on our August, late August, a total return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of a total return swap, so the OTC equity swaps market. With the no-action relief until October 3, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3rd, but that week, immediately, with several participants trade in that first week, about 3,500 contracts -- so you're talking about $3.5 billion, approximately, and they traded in blocks of about $500 million each. So you have very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total return futures. In terms of the next 4 years, it's only the top 20 or 21 [ph] institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next 4 years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms, so we do expect it -- relative to our focus on it, relative to new products and services that we're offering, that will -- there'll be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the new cleared products as well as the new -- as well as with futures products."

We're actually very excited about the growth rates that we've been able to unlock in our energy complex. And it's a number of factors both -- that we are controlling for in terms of our ability to both roll out product, acquire new customers, position our benchmark product in what is a market that is shifting structurally in favor of our benchmark products that whether you look at the -- lifting the export ban in crude back in December of 2015, creating a water balloon product that is WTI, we now have a product that the market is increasingly adopting as a global benchmark. As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we're leveraging. Bryan's team's on the ground in Europe and in Asia to go access and bring new customers on board. And we actually think about the energies complex as a whole. We're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So as we talk about the overall franchise on Slide 9 of the deck that we sent you guys, in the same structural shifts we talk about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over Brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On Slide 9, on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry Hub products between the prices both in Asia and Germany. And you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market, and that's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we're excited about, as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part that we launch will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally. Also, the open interest levels, over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels for open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time highs in our large open interest holders on the futures side. And on the options, as we talked about previously, record levels of electronification and nat gas options and continued growth. Our nat gas options business at over 30% this year."

We faced the market structure in nat gas options a year ago that was 95% brokered, less than 5% traded on screen. So every time we shifted businesses from a brokered market on to the screen, we've done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the central limit order book. The downside of that is you end up giving up our block surcharge when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central limit order book. So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen, so we're finding that great deal of success, moving from less than 10% electronic to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September, so it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we've undertaken in other markets as we globalize and electronify them and with the business up 31%, typically, you also start to move through volume tiers as well. So we consider this a first world problem relative to volumes growth and a disciplined move on to a central limit order book."

First of all, just to give you a little color, since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver's been in full effect now for almost a year, where in all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscriber fee revenues",408,"Yes. It's Bryan. First of all, just to give you a little color, since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver's been in full effect now for almost a year, where in all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscriber fee revenues and our subscribers remain stable. Now as we continued to advance our market data and IP growth opportunities, we've been performing a holistic assessment of our current program. And our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value in revenues from our assets. So for example in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and nontrading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing scheme does not fully capture the value, Alex, described to these different user segments. And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities, and there is a significant pipeline of demand per our data IP as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase. Now this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly and going after those opportunities on a derived basis. I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform which we just recently introduced in conjunction with TickSmith. The usable data needs to be instantly accessible, and we've done that with our recent introduction of TickVault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously. So this is making data access easily -- easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing, so we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we're relooking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective."

We have, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% of the retail trade globally. And if we could just double that, you can imagine what the revenue could do for this company. So we are taking a strong look at that. I think what's important is, here, we're not targeting the mom and pops on the street. When we call retail, we're talking about participants that are in the market today trading anywhere from 10 to 20 contracts a day already, and we're trying to harness that into the business. What I think is also fascinating is when you look at some of these discount retail equity brokers traditionally, they're starting to merge together the ones that offer futures. So that only bodes well for us to concentrate this more among people that are already offering these products."

We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our volume is up 8% as is our transactions revenue, while earnings per share is up more than 10%. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, then I will shift to a few product highlights. 
We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last 5 years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grew in the low single digits, while the U.S. activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We also saw noticeable outperformance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. 
In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The U.S. trading hours volume is down 1% because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.
Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to-date with more than 57% and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increased adoption of Globex execution for complex options spreads. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all options spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012. 
We continue to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year treasury contract reached 73,000 contracts per day compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open interest continues to build, and the bid/offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with Wednesday expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on 1 day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to tailor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 Total Return Index Futures, and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some clear FX products like NDFs and Options and potential new futures contracts, primarily in interest rate, equity and FX.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had another strong quarter led by metals and energy, up 22% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities asset classes. We reach an all-time high this month in the number of large open interest holders in energy, while ags and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remain near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.
Our Metals business has been our fastest-growing segment this year with volumes up 29% to-date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our Metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading days. And in our industrial metals area, we continued to build on our success, with our copper business up 17% year-to-date compared to LME's copper business, which is down 7%. We also continued to grow our Copper Open Interest with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our Metals business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.
Energy was particularly strong. In Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%. Natural gas rose 23%. And refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume.
Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single-day volume record as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago. We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the U.S. now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well-positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically settled Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark Energy products in our global customer growth, with Energy business in Asia up 104% in September.
Turning to financial products and starting with Interest Rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date, we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September of about 55 million contracts was up 15% with Eurodollars up 17%, and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our Fedwatch tool is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open interest in the first 4 quarterly Eurodollars futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts which is a 4-year high.
Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date fed funds futures average daily volume is up 70% to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to-date and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year to more than 80%. 
Over-the-counter swaps revenue approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and we have compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.
Turning to equities. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12% but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the E-mini S&P futures that we trade compared to these SPDR ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was 7x that of the SPDR. This year in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10x higher. When you think about the all-in cost to trade based on a tight bid/offer spread and deep liquidity, we have considerably less expenses.
Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.
In summary, through the hard work of our staff, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset class",918,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August in 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility, by definition, does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I'm pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through 3 quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share.
Our adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%.
Our rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a member/nonmember shift in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower priced natural gas options, which created a negative venue shift.
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million, and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to the last year. And the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our noncompensation-related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries which was the highest level we have ever achieved.
Turning to investment income. We received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&FBOVESPA. In addition, our investment returns, generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions, increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. 
Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&FBOVESPA stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast majority of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend. We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come. 
During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continue to leverage more software- and infrastructure-as-a-service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center. 
Last quarter, I mentioned the subscription program that we made available for our members. We continue to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take-up so far has been relatively small. We booked about $170,000 in Q3. And with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per year of new revenue.
We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long-term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes which reduces the overall costs to trade on our markets as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes and open interest and an expanding number of global participants, the value to our customers from transacting in
Our markets has never been greater. 
We remain focused on being as efficient as possible. We have been reducing the core operating costs to free up expense dollars to deploy on growth
Initiatives. We are currently working on our 2017 budget and will report out on our plans next quarter. 
Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance, excluding license fees, for the second half of 2016 down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter for marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth-oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis. 
In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million, and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent. And since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And I know going into '17, it's early, but when we think about what you guys have said kind of longer term in like the low single-digit expense growth, just any color that you can give on how much of that is like volume oriented.

When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into 3 categories. One is compensation, which, similar to this quarter last year, included our annual adjustments to the estimates associated with stock-based compensation, which will cause an increase quarter-over-quarter -- or I mean, sorry, quarterly sequentially, an increase in the fourth quarter. There's some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior years is seasonably higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer-facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year, and we decided not to adjust our guidance.

But we did say that we'd be between the low and mid-single digits with the higher end of the mid-single digits being due to higher revenue achievement. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017."

I think that this is one of those topics that I've heard forever since I've been here in the last 35, 36 years. People have said, and I've actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency, and they also prevail in the Senate and the House and control all 3 branches of the government, that it would be easier to pass a transaction tax. Well, I would say, what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario when President Barack Obama became elected and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do anything. We work very hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they'd be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging, all the asset classes that Mr. Gill just referenced. And if those spreads widen, I've testified many times how you put forward the transaction tax of a couple hundred million dollars, let me show you how it cost the consumer several billion dollars by doing so. 
So I think as long as we act professional and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax. But at the same time, taxes are going to probably continue to go up in some way, shape or form. I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that, around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, they're losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products, which people hold for a period of a lot longer, and they have a much larger universe of participants. When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a very small group of people, as I said earlier, and I just can't see even how our government would look at that. And that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates. Listen, we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And if in fact, the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going to be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic side of the aisle understands that."

On the uncleared margin rules, September 1 was the date U.S., Japan and Canada implemented them. The CFTC had a no-action relief until October 3. The biggest impact, according to the BIS reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there that we think could help relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings, we currently have 7 clearing members who have been approved by the Risk Committee, 2 new clearing members in the last couple of months. And we're excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared margin requirements in the rates area. 
Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF mark offering out here. We also clear cash settle forwards. But in addition to that, we've began working very hard on OTC FX options clearing. And we believe the combination of all those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We're working very closely with a set of market participants on that. In terms of equities, equities, according to BIS reports, kind of third after those 2 asset classes in terms of the impacts on the marketplace. We launched on August, late August, a total return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of a total return swap, so the OTC equity swaps market. With the no-action relief until October 3, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3, but that week, immediately, with several participants trade in their first week, about 3,500 contracts. So you're talking about $3.5 billion, approximately, and they traded in blocks of about $500 million each. So you have very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total return futures. 
In terms of the next 4 years, it's only the top 20 or 21 institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next 4 years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms, so we do expect it -- relative to our focus on it, relative to new products and services that we're offering, that will -- there'll be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the our -- with the new cleared products as well as the new -- as well as our futures products."

And it's a number of factors both -- that we are controlling for in terms of our ability to both roll out product, acquire new customers, position our benchmark products in what is a market that is shifting structurally in favor of our benchmark products that whether you look at the -- lifting the export ban in crude back in December of 2015, creating a water-borne product that is WTI, we now have a product that the market is increasingly adopting as a global benchmark. As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we're leveraging. Bryan's team's on the ground in Europe and in Asia to get access and bring new customers on board. 
And we actually think about the energies complex as a whole. We're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So as we talk about the overall franchise on Slide 9 of the deck that we sent you guys, in the same structural shifts we talk about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over Brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On Slide 9, on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry Hub products between the prices both in Asia and Germany. And you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market, and that's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we're excited about, as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part that we launch will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally. 
Also, the open interest levels, over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels for open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time highs in our large open interest holders on the futures side. And on the options, as we talked about previously, record levels of electronification and nat gas options and continued growth. Our nat gas options business up over 30% this year."

We've got a market that's up over 30% in September volume-wise, as I mentioned, the market share increasing now 70% on the futures side. Our market share relative of the nat gas options is still around 64% or 65%. But what we've really done is we've focused on electronifying the nat gas options business. So when you look at what the other offerings are out there, this is a market that's typically been brokered, and we're the ones that have gone from less than 10% electronic in nat gas options to a record of over 40%, as Gill mentioned at the top of the call. And as you've seen us do across products over time, when you focus on functionality in electronic access to your options market, bringing people to the transparent central and order book, we tend to see the velocity of transactions increase, and more important, we can access a global customer base. That's really hard to do in a block market. 
So we're excited about the progress we've made. The large open interest holder record levels that we're touching on is really a reflection of the increased global adoption of our product set, so we're excited about the multiple records we've hit in nat gas options, ADV, single-day record, large open interest holders, as well as the deferred month liquidity that we have built and focused on over the last 12 months as well. Our open interest in months 6 through 12 is up 36% as we're focusing on the commercial end-user customers to bring them into our market, and those are the physical users that are using our product."

On the nat gas side, as John mentioned, there's 2 things going on. Number one, you've seen us build into sustainable growth in options markets by making sure that we can build those markets electronically, so we can market that liquidity globally. We faced the market structure in nat gas options a year ago that was 95% brokered, less than 5% traded on screen. So every time we shifted businesses from a brokered market onto the screen, we've done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the central limit order book. The downside of that is you end up giving up our block surcharge when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central limit order book. 
So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen, so we're finding that great deal of success, moving from less than 10% electronic to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September. So it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we've undertaken in other markets as we globalize and electronify them, and with the business up 31%, typically, you also start to move through volume tiers as well. So we consider this a first world problem relative to volumes growth and a disciplined move on to a central limit order book."

First of all, just to give you a little color, since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver's been in full effect now for almost a year, where in all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscriber fee revenues and our subscribers remain stable. Now as we continued to advance our market data and IP growth opportunities, we've been performing a holistic assessment of our current program. And our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value in revenues from our assets. So for example in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and nontrading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing scheme does not fully capture the value Alex described to these different user segments. 
And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities, and there is a significant pipeline of demand per our data IP as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase. Now this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly and going after those opportunities on a derived basis. I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform which we just recently introduced in conjunction with TickSmith. The usable data needs to be instantly accessible, and we've done that with our recent introduction of TickVault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously. 
So this is making data access easily -- easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing, so we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we're relooking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective."

So we are taking a strong look at that. I think what's important is, here, we're not targeting the mom and pops on the street. When we call retail, we're talking about participants that are in the market today trading anywhere from 10 to 20 contracts a day already, and we're trying to harness that into the business. What I think is also fascinating is when you look at some of these discount retail equity brokers traditionally, they're starting to merge together the ones that offer futures.

We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, our volume is up 8% as is our transactions revenue, while earnings per share is up more than 10%. 
This morning, I will start with our secular drivers, then I will shift to a few product highlights. 
We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last 5 years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grew in the low single digits, while the U.S. activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We also saw noticeable outperformance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. 
In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The U.S. trading hours volume is down 1% because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.
Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to-date with more than 57% and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increased adoption of Globex execution for complex options spreads. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all options spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012. 
We continue to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year treasury contract reached 73,000 contracts per day compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open interest continues to build, and the bid/offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with Wednesday expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on 1 day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to tailor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 Total Return Index Futures, and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some clear FX products like NDFs and Options and potential new futures contracts, primarily in interest rate, equity and FX.
Moving on to our commodities portfolio. We had another strong quarter led by metals and energy, up 22% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities asset classes. We reach an all-time high this month in the number of large open interest holders in energy, while ags and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remain near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.
Our Metals business has been our fastest-growing segment this year with volumes up 29% to-date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our Metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading days. And in our industrial metals area, we continued to build on our success, with our copper business up 17% year-to-date compared to LME's copper business, which is down 7%. We also continued to grow our Copper Open Interest with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our Metals business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.
Energy was particularly strong. In Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%. Natural gas rose 23%. And refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume.
Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single-day volume record as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago. We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the U.S. now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well-positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically settled Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark Energy products in our global customer growth, with Energy business in Asia up 104% in September.
Turning to financial products and starting with Interest Rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date, we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September of about 55 million contracts was up 15% with Eurodollars up 17%, and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our Fedwatch tool is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open interest in the first 4 quarterly Eurodollars futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts which is a 4-year high.
Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date fed funds futures average daily volume is up 70% to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to-date and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year to more than 80%. 
Over-the-counter swaps revenue approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and we have compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.
Turning to equities. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12% but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the E-mini S&P futures that we trade compared to these SPDR ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was 7x that of the SPDR. This year in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10x higher. When you think about the all-in cost to trade based on a tight bid/offer spread and deep liquidity, we have considerably less expenses.
Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.
In summary, through the hard work of our staff, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,383905703,1085123,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset class",918,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August in 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility, by definition, does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I'm pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through 3 quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share.
Our adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%.
Our rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a member/nonmember shift in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower priced natural gas options, which created a negative venue shift.
Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million, and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to the last year. And the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our noncompensation-related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line. Our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries which was the highest level we have ever achieved.
Turning to investment income. We received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&FBOVESPA. In addition, our investment returns, generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions, increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. 
Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&FBOVESPA stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast majority of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend. We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come. 
During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continue to leverage more software- and infrastructure-as-a-service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center. 
Last quarter, I mentioned the subscription program that we made available for our members. We continue to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take-up so far has been relatively small. We booked about $170,000 in Q3. And with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per year of new revenue.
We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long-term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes which reduces the overall costs to trade on our markets as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes and open interest and an expanding number of global participants, the value to our customers from transacting in our markets has never been greater. 
We remain focused on being as efficient as possible. We have been reducing the core operating costs to free up expense dollars to deploy on growth initiatives. We are currently working on our 2017 budget and will report out on our plans next quarter. 
Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance, excluding license fees, for the second half of 2016 down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter for marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth-oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis. 
In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million, and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent. And since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into 3 categories. One is compensation, which, similar to this quarter last year, included our annual adjustments to the estimates associated with stock-based compensation, which will cause an increase quarter-over-quarter -- or I mean, sorry, quarterly sequentially, an increase in the fourth quarter. There's some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior years is seasonably higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer-facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year, and we decided not to adjust our guidance. 
When you take a look at next year, we'll update everybody in the fourth quarter's conference call. But we did say that we'd be between the low and mid-single digits with the higher end of the mid-single digits being due to higher revenue achievement. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017."

I think that this is one of those topics that I've heard forever since I've been here in the last 35, 36 years. People have said, and I've actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency, and they also prevail in the Senate and the House and control all 3 branches of the government, that it would be easier to pass a transaction tax. Well, I would say, what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario when President Barack Obama became elected and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do anything. We work very hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they'd be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging, all the asset classes that Mr. Gill just referenced. And if those spreads widen, I've testified many times how you put forward the transaction tax of a couple hundred million dollars, let me show you how it cost the consumer several billion dollars by doing so. 
So I think as long as we act professional and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax. But at the same time, taxes are going to probably continue to go up in some way, shape or form. I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that, around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, they're losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products, which people hold for a period of a lot longer, and they have a much larger universe of participants. When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a very small group of people, as I said earlier, and I just can't see even how our government would look at that. And that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates. Listen, we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And if in fact, the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going to be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic side of the aisle understands that."

On the uncleared margin rules, September 1 was the date U.S., Japan and Canada implemented them. The CFTC had a no-action relief until October 3. The biggest impact, according to the BIS reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there that we think could help relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings, we currently have 7 clearing members who have been approved by the Risk Committee, 2 new clearing members in the last couple of months. And we're excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared margin requirements in the rates area. 
Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF mark offering out here. We also clear cash settle forwards. But in addition to that, we've began working very hard on OTC FX options clearing. And we believe the combination of all those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We're working very closely with a set of market participants on that. In terms of equities, equities, according to BIS reports, kind of third after those 2 asset classes in terms of the impacts on the marketplace. We launched on August, late August, a total return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of a total return swap, so the OTC equity swaps market. With the no-action relief until October 3, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3, but that week, immediately, with several participants trade in their first week, about 3,500 contracts. So you're talking about $3.5 billion, approximately, and they traded in blocks of about $500 million each. So you have very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total return futures. 
In terms of the next 4 years, it's only the top 20 or 21 institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next 4 years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms, so we do expect it -- relative to our focus on it, relative to new products and services that we're offering, that will -- there'll be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the our -- with the new cleared products as well as the new -- as well as our futures products."

But we're also very, very much in tune with respect to the moral hazard issue here. And if you look at our skin in the game and what the amount is, there are tons of views out there, all the ad hoc views with respect to what that amount should actually be. From our perspective, at the $500 million or so level that we have across the board, it's about the average contribution of each of those firms, all right. And we have affirmatively said that we strongly believe that those that bring risk should be the ones that fund the guarantee fund. We manage the risk that they bring, and we are ultra-comfortable with the levels that we have. Anything to add, Kim?"

The clearinghouse needs the alignment of incentives with the clearing member. But the clearing members are very important participants in any kind of default management situation. And the mutualization of risk across clearing mechanisms is part of the reason why clearinghouse mechanism works so effectively. And turning too much of that to the contribution of the CCP upfront could change the dynamics of the risk mechanisms that support a good default management. So the moral hazard is very real and shows up in multiple ways in the process."

We're actually very excited about the growth rates that we've been able to unlock in our energy complex. And it's a number of factors both -- that we are controlling for in terms of our ability to both roll out product, acquire new customers, position our benchmark products in what is a market that is shifting structurally in favor of our benchmark products that whether you look at the -- lifting the export ban in crude back in December of 2015, creating a water-borne product that is WTI, we now have a product that the market is increasingly adopting as a global benchmark. As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we're leveraging. Bryan's team's on the ground in Europe and in Asia to get access and bring new customers on board. 
And we actually think about the energies complex as a whole. We're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So as we talk about the overall franchise on Slide 9 of the deck that we sent you guys, in the same structural shifts we talk about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over Brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On Slide 9, on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry Hub products between the prices both in Asia and Germany. And you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market, and that's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we're excited about, as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part that we launch will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally. 
Also, the open interest levels, over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels for open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time highs in our large open interest holders on the futures side. And on the options, as we talked about previously, record levels of electronification and nat gas options and continued growth. Our nat gas options business up over 30% this year."

And as you've seen us do across products over time, when you focus on functionality in electronic access to your options market, bringing people to the transparent central and order book, we tend to see the velocity of transactions increase, and more important, we can access a global customer base. That's really hard to do in a block market. 
So we're excited about the progress we've made. The large open interest holder record levels that we're touching on is really a reflection of the increased global adoption of our product set, so we're excited about the multiple records we've hit in nat gas options, ADV, single-day record, large open interest holders, as well as the deferred month liquidity that we have built and focused on over the last 12 months as well.

On the nat gas side, as John mentioned, there's 2 things going on. Number one, you've seen us build into sustainable growth in options markets by making sure that we can build those markets electronically, so we can market that liquidity globally. We faced the market structure in nat gas options a year ago that was 95% brokered, less than 5% traded on screen. So every time we shifted businesses from a brokered market onto the screen, we've done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the central limit order book. The downside of that is you end up giving up our block surcharge when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central limit order book. 
So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen, so we're finding that great deal of success, moving from less than 10% electronic to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September. So it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we've undertaken in other markets as we globalize and electronify them, and with the business up 31%, typically, you also start to move through volume tiers as well. So we consider this a first world problem relative to volumes growth and a disciplined move on to a central limit order book."

First of all, just to give you a little color, since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver's been in full effect now for almost a year, where in all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscriber fee revenues and our subscribers remain stable. Now as we continued to advance our market data and IP growth opportunities, we've been performing a holistic assessment of our current program. And our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value in revenues from our assets. So for example in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and nontrading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing scheme does not fully capture the value Alex described to these different user segments. 
And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities, and there is a significant pipeline of demand per our data IP as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase. Now this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly and going after those opportunities on a derived basis. I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform which we just recently introduced in conjunction with TickSmith. The usable data needs to be instantly accessible, and we've done that with our recent introduction of TickVault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously. 
So this is making data access easily -- easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing, so we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we're relooking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective."

No, I agree with that. I think that when you look at our revenue coming out of our traditional retail, the way we measured it, basically next to nothing and then putting in roughly a couple hundred million dollars, I think, last year alone in coming from the retail side of the business, the upside is just extraordinary. We have, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% of the retail trade globally. And that if we could just double that, you can imagine what the revenue could do for this company. So we are taking a strong look at that. I think what's important is, here, we're not targeting the mom and pops on the street. When we call retail, we're talking about participants that are in the market today trading anywhere from 10 to 20 contracts a day already, and we're trying to harness that into the business. What I think is also fascinating is when you look at some of these discount retail equity brokers traditionally, they're starting to merge together the ones that offer futures. So that only bodes well for us to concentrate this more among people that are already offering these products."
