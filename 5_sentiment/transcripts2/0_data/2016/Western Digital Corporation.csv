With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December",1009,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 
With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. He will also provide an update on the expected integration savings resulting from the lift of almost all of the restrictions MOFCOM have placed on our business. 
We continue to execute well as we manage our business within an increasingly challenging global economic environment. We reported revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We also had strong free cash flow performance of $449 million and our storage shipments for the December quarter grew to 69.1 exabytes. The HDD TAM in the December quarter came in somewhat below our expectations. The gaming sector was weaker and enterprise volumes were a bit lighter than expected. We anticipate weak demand in the March quarter, resulting in a hard drive TAM of approximately 100 million units. The main factors behind this forecast are the expected combination of seasonal and secular trends, as well as increased caution among customers and end markets relative to challenging global economic conditions. Being able to integrate our HGST and WD subsidiaries and transform into one company affords us the opportunity to optimize our business model for both the near and long-term. We are taking a number of important steps in this context. We are reducing our cost base through a series of planned actions, including the elimination of redundancy in functions, products and facilities. Olivier will provide additional detail in the magnitude and timing of the integration related savings, but let me cite a few examples. 
Last week, we announced the closure of our head waiver manufacturing facility in Ottawa, Japan, one of our three head wafers facilities. We are streamlining our product road map by focusing our efforts to eliminate redundancy and optimize the products we offer, resulting in the elimination of a minimum of 6 programs. And we recently set our new leadership team with a plan to complete our new companywide organizational structure in the June quarter. We believe this aggressive approach to reduce our cost structure will maintain and extend our cost leadership in the hard drive industry. 
Turning to the longer-term. We remain focused on transforming Western Digital into one of the world's leading companies in the large, rapidly changing and high-growth storage industry. We continue to believe in the unabated growth in the creation of data, in the amount of data being stored and in our ability to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We continue to diversify our revenue base in the higher growth areas, aligned with cloud storage and the third platform of computing. This includes building on our track record of innovation in Capacity Enterprise, most recently, with our leadership in helium sealed drives. Our helium drives shipments totaled a record 1.5 million in the December quarter, including initial shipments of our 10-terabyte drive, our third-generation helium drive. First shipped by Western Digital in 2013, we are pleased with the success and wider adoption of helium technology and enterprise IT as it marks the shift for hard drive makers to deliver value added storage solutions to customers based on a value proposition of better total cost of ownership. 
Our Enterprise SSD revenue grew to $270 million in the December quarter. While we continue to believe Enterprise SSD will be one of our main growth drivers, we expect to see a pause in our growth in the March quarter, given typical seasonal factors in enterprise IT spending and as we proceed through a SAS product transition. And we continue to see good traction in our Active Archive systems business, with several wins in Tier 2 cloud infrastructure, backup and archive applications and other vertical markets. 
Regarding the SanDisk acquisition. We are pleased with the progress we're making in obtaining required regulatory approvals. It has always been our goal to close the acquisition as soon as possible and as noted in our Form 8-K filing earlier this month, we have competed the FTC review in the U.S. I would also note that the FTC completed its review without issuing a second request, which we see as confirmation of our view that this transaction is pro competitive. We also received recent approvals from antitrust agencies in Singapore and Japan. Based on our work with other agencies around the world, we currently anticipate that the acquisition will close in the June quarter. 
I would like to emphasize the importance of the acquisition of SanDisk to our overall strategic plan. Once we close the acquisition, we will have the broadest set of products to offer our customers, a deep technology base across nonvolatile memory and rotating magnetic media and an expanded addressable market. 
On the Unisplendour investment, we and Unisplendour continue to work with [indiscernible] as they review the proposed investment in Western Digital. [indiscernible] has not yet reached a decision on whether the investment is a covered transaction. We continue to believe that we have structured this investment carefully in order to avoid that result. Given [indiscernible] heavy caseload towards the end of last year, we asked to withdraw and refile our notice in order to provide additional time for us to engage with them on our case. Sifius agreed to our request and we refiled in January. We know and expect a decision from Sifius some time in February. Our strategic joint venture with Unisplendour to sell our storage systems in Japan is proceeding as planned. We successfully negotiated its terms, including operational and governance plans in late 2015. And with those complete, we are now in the process of satisfying certain closing conditions while simultaneously recruiting and staffing the JV. 
I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Olivier will now provide his commentary before we take your questions."

Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.3 billion. We shipped a total of 49.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.5% and operating expenses totaled $542 million. Non-GAAP tax expense for the December quarter was $21 million or 5% of non-GAAP pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $374 million or $1.60 per share. In the December quarter, we generated $598 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $449 million. Our CapEx totaled $149 million or 4% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was held in the U.S. 
I will now provide an update regarding the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. All of my references in the following commentary are based on calendar year. To remind everyone, we previously indicated that we would realize $400 million of operating expense savings. We also said we would achieve additional meaningful savings from reductions in cost of goods sold. Finally, we indicated these savings would be obtained -- attained over a 1 to 2 years period. We have 3 main components in realizing these savings, including: asset and footprint reduction; product road map consolidation; and organization rationalization. During our last earnings call, we also mentioned that the quarterly baseline for operating expenses is $570 million from which these cost savings should be calculated. Following our initial integration planning, we continue to expect to realize $400 million of operating expense reduction per year on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. The cost of goods sold, we expect to realize $250 million of synergy per year on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. This will give us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We expect to achieve 50% of the synergy run rate by the end of 2016, and the balance by the end of 2017. We currently estimate cash cost to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. This estimate will continue to be refined as we finalize our cost reduction effort. Finally, we expect about 75% of this cost to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. 
Moving on to our guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect: gross margin percentage to be up from our December quarter; operating expenses of approximately $500 million; we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30. 
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

The first thing is that, the closing of the SanDisk acquisition is not contingent upon the closing of the Unis transaction.

Under either event, we will be seeking shareholder vote on the transaction and the only question is, is will the number of shares exceed 20% of our outstanding shares. And so there is a scenario where we would seek a shareholder vote, but it may not require the issuance of 20% of our shareholders that either way, we will be conducting a proxy solicitation and vote on behalf of our shareholders.

This is Steve. Let me address the first part of that question. One of the things I think that is important to emphasize is that when we evaluated the merits of doing the SanDisk transaction, there's a number of things that we looked at. One is, is that we did -- we looked at various different scenarios from a business performance level. And we expected and anticipated that there could be some increased volatility from a market perspective, both from a macro perspective, as well as volatility as it relates to supply/demand dynamics in demand market. So we have stressed cases, we have base case scenarios, we also had bulk case scenarios. And in all those scenarios, the transaction prove to be value creating for our shareholders longer-term, so we're very confident in that regard. Additionally, as we approach the end of the year, we all know that we were looking at the potential for an increasing rate environment here in the U.S. So we factored in some expectation of rate increases in terms of that portion of our financing that would be affected by rate increases. And again, those rate increases, to date, have been within our expectations and we're confident that, that will remain the case. Additionally, the other thing that we've talked about is -- and there's additional details, to some degree in our S-4 filing, is that we expect to quickly deleverage our debt to the tune of specifically $3 million within a short period -- $3 billion -- sorry, $3 billion within a short period of time after the closing of the transaction. That deleveraging will incur in those areas in the market where we are more exposed to interest rate exposure. And so for those various reasons, I would emphasize that we continue to be very confident with regards to our ability to service the debt post close the SanDisk transaction. So I'll ask Mike to comment on TAM."

And there's a lot of moving parts in terms of what happens with gross margin. They are -- the one thing that -- the biggest drag in terms of near-term on our gross margins, if you want to call it that. I mean, let's be honest. We still continue to have strong gross margin performance, that has been weaker enterprise volumes. And it really has to do with what Mike was talking about in that the first half of calendar year 2015 had a higher mix of enterprise volumes and then, there was an absorption of that, those drives in the back half, we will see that kind of flip and go to normal seasonality in calendar year '16. So all things remaining equal, we should see our margins begin to benefit from that higher gross margin level as we exit calendar year 2016. But of course, there can be other factors, including pricing, which can impact things, there can be total volumes.

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. He will also provide an update on the expected integration savings, resulting from the lift of almost all of the restrictions MOFCOM had placed on our business. 
We continue to execute well as we manage our business within an increasingly challenging global economic environment. We reported revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We also had strong free cash flow performance of $449 million, and our storage shipments for the December quarter grew to 69.1 exabytes. The HDD TAM in the December quarter came in somewhat below our expectations. The gaming sector was weaker, and enterprise volumes were a bit lighter than expected. We anticipate weak demand in the March quarter, resulting in a hard drive TAM of approximately 100 million units. 
The main factors behind this forecast are the expected combination of seasonal and secular trends as well as increased caution among customers and end markets relative to challenging global economic conditions. Being able to integrate our HGST and WD subsidiaries and transform into one company, affords us the opportunity to optimize our business model for both the near and long term. We are taking a number of important steps in this context. We are reducing our cost base through a series of planned actions, including the elimination of redundancy in functions, products and facilities. Olivier will provide additional detail on the magnitude and timing of the integration-related savings, but let me cite a few examples. 
Last week, we announced the closure of our head wafer manufacturing facility in Ottawa, Japan: 1 of our 3 head wafer facilities. We are streamlining our product roadmap by focusing our efforts to eliminate redundancy and optimize the products we offer, resulting in the elimination of a minimum of 6 programs. And we recently set our new leadership team, with a plan to complete our new company-wide organizational structure in the June quarter. We believe this aggressive approach to reduce our cost structure will maintain and extend our cost leadership in the hard drive industry. 
Turning to the longer term. We remain focused on transforming Western Digital into one of the world's leading companies in the large, rapidly changing and high-growth storage industry. We continue to believe in the unabated growth in the creation of data, in the amount of data being stored and in our ability to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We continue to diversify our revenue base in the higher growth areas, aligned with cloud storage and the third platform of computing. This includes building on our track record of innovation in Capacity Enterprise, most recently, with our leadership in helium sealed drives. Our helium drives shipments totaled a record 1.5 million in the December quarter, including initial shipments of our 10-terabyte drive, our third-generation helium drive. First shipped by Western Digital in 2013, we are pleased with the success and wider adoption of helium technology and enterprise IT, as it marks the shift for hard drive makers to deliver value-added storage solutions to customers based on a value proposition of better total cost of ownership.
Our Enterprise SSD revenue grew to $270 million in the December quarter. While we continue to believe Enterprise SSD will be one of our main growth drivers, we expect to see a pause in our growth in the March quarter, given typical seasonal factors in enterprise IT spending and as we proceed through a SAS product transition. And we continue to see good traction in our Active Archive systems business, with several wins in Tier 2 cloud infrastructure, backup and archive applications and other vertical markets. 
Regarding the SanDisk acquisition. We are pleased with the progress we are  making in obtaining required regulatory approvals. It has always been our goal to close the acquisition as soon as possible, and as noted in our Form 8-K filing earlier this month, we have competed the FTC review in the U.S. I would also note that the FTC completed its review without issuing a second request, which we see as confirmation of our view that this transaction is pro competitive. We have also received recent approvals from antitrust agencies in Singapore and Japan. Based on our work with other agencies around the world, we currently anticipate that the acquisition will close in the June quarter.
I would like to emphasize the importance of the acquisition of SanDisk to our overall strategic plan. Once we close the acquisition, we will have the broadest set of products to offer our customers, a deep technology base across nonvolatile memory and rotating magnetic media and an expanded addressable market. 
On the Unisplendour investment, we and Unisplendour continue to work with CFIUS as they review the proposed investment in Western Digital. CFIUS has not yet reached a decision on whether the investment is a covered transaction. We continue to believe that we have structured this investment carefully in order to avoid that result. Given CFIUS' heavy caseload towards the end of last year, we asked to withdraw and refile our notice in order to provide additional time for us to engage with them on our case. CFIUS agreed to our request, and we refiled in January. We now expect A decision from CFIUS sometime in February. Our strategic joint venture with Unisplendour to sell our storage systems in Japan is proceeding as planned. We successfully negotiated its terms, including operational and governance plans in late 2015. And with those complete, we are now in the process of satisfying certain closing conditions while simultaneously recruiting and staffing the JV.
I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Olivier will now provide his commentary before we take your questions."

We shipped a total of 49.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.5%, and operating expenses totaled $542 million. Non-GAAP tax expense for the December quarter was $21 million or 5% of non-GAAP pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $374 million or $1.60 per share. In the December quarter, we generated $598 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $449 million. Our CapEx totaled $149 million or 4% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was held in the U.S. 
I will now provide an update regarding the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. All of my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. To remind everyone, we previously indicated that we would realize $400 million of operating expense savings. We also said we would achieve additional meaningful savings from reductions in cost of goods sold. 
Finally, we indicated these savings would be obtained over a 1 to 2 years period. We have 3 main components in realizing these savings, including: asset and footprint reduction; product roadmap consolidation; and organization rationalization. During our last earnings call, we also mentioned that the quarterly baseline for operating expenses is $570 million from which these cost savings should be calculated. 
Following our initial integration planning, we continue to expect to realize $400 million of operating expense reduction per year on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. The cost of goods sold, we expect to realize $250 million of synergy per year on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. This would give us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We expect to achieve 50% of the synergy run rate by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. We currently estimate cash cost to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. This estimate will continue to be refined as we finalize our cost reduction efforts. Finally, we expect about 75% of this cost to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.
Moving on to our guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our December quarter, operating expenses of approximately $500 million, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30.

Let me address the first part of that question. One of the things I think that is important to emphasize is that when we evaluated the merits of doing the SanDisk transaction, there's a number of things that we looked at. One is, is that we did -- we looked at various different scenarios from a business performance level. And we expected and anticipated that there could be some increased volatility from a market perspective, both from a macro perspective as well as volatility as it relates to supply/demand dynamics in demand market. So we have stressed cases, we have base case scenarios, we also had bull case scenarios. And in all those scenarios, the transaction proved to be value creating for our shareholders longer term, so we're very confident in that regard. Additionally, as we approach the end of the year, we all know that we were looking at the potential for an increasing rate environment here in the U.S. So we factored in some expectation of rate increases in terms of that portion of our financing that would be affected by rate increases. And again, those rate increases, to date, have been within our expectations and we're confident that, that will remain the case. Additionally, the other thing that we've talked about is -- and there is additional details, to some degree in our S-4 filing, is that we expect to quickly deleverage our debt to the tune of specifically $3 million within a short period -- $3 billion -- sorry, $3 billion within a short period of time after the closing of the transaction. That deleveraging will incur in those areas in the market where we are more exposed to interest rate exposure. And so for those various reasons, I would emphasize that we continue to be very confident with regards to our ability to service the debt post close of the SanDisk transaction. So I'll ask Mike to comment on TAM."

The one thing that I would comment on is that subsequent to that period, as individual entities, there have been a number of OpEx reduction efforts that have occurred since that time. And so the actual reduction in our operating expenses from the close of the HGST-WD transaction is actually much greater than an annual run rate of $400 million. For example, if you remember, West -- the WD sub was engaged in the performance enterprise market. We have exited -- on the WD side, that business was exited. The OpEx savings were saved there. And so net, kind of apples-to-apples, we've actually reduced our OpEx more than that original $400 million that we talked about 3.5 years ago."

We see an increasing adoption of helium class drives as the people deploying infrastructure realize the benefits of the TCO that, that technology offers. We articulated that growth rate, we would expect to cross that total segment. Relative to the performance category, I just talked a little bit about that. We do see the continuing penetration of flash-based products into that marketplace. We see that continuing through the balance of the year as evidenced by a number of people in their systems announcements most recently. We would expect that to benefit from that, obviously, with our strategy of being media agnostic as we move forward with completion of the SanDisk acquisition."

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December",1010,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.  With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. He will also provide an update on the expected integration savings, resulting from the lift of almost all of the restrictions MOFCOM had placed on our business. 
We continue to execute well as we manage our business within an increasingly challenging global economic environment. We reported revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We also had strong free cash flow performance of $449 million, and our storage shipments for the December quarter grew to 69.1 exabytes. The HDD TAM in the December quarter came in somewhat below our expectations. The gaming sector was weaker, and enterprise volumes were a bit lighter than expected. We anticipate weak demand in the March quarter, resulting in a hard drive TAM of approximately 100 million units. 
The main factors behind this forecast are the expected combination of seasonal and secular trends as well as increased caution among customers and end markets relative to challenging global economic conditions. Being able to integrate our HGST and WD subsidiaries and transform into one company, affords us the opportunity to optimize our business model for both the near and long term. We are taking a number of important steps in this context. We are reducing our cost base through a series of planned actions, including the elimination of redundancy in functions, products and facilities. Olivier will provide additional detail on the magnitude and timing of the integration-related savings, but let me cite a few examples. 
Last week, we announced the closure of our head wafer manufacturing facility in Odawara, Japan: 1 of our 3 head wafer facilities. We are streamlining our product roadmap by focusing our efforts to eliminate redundancy and optimize the products we offer, resulting in the elimination of a minimum of 6 programs. And we recently set our new leadership team, with a plan to complete our new company-wide organizational structure in the June quarter. We believe this aggressive approach to reduce our cost structure will maintain and extend our cost leadership in the hard drive industry. 
Turning to the longer term. We remain focused on transforming Western Digital into one of the world's leading companies in the large, rapidly changing and high-growth storage industry. We continue to believe in the unabated growth in the creation of data, in the amount of data being stored and in our ability to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We continue to diversify our revenue base in the higher growth areas, aligned with cloud storage and the third platform of computing. This includes building on our track record of innovation in Capacity Enterprise, most recently, with our leadership in helium-sealed drives. Our helium drives shipments totaled a record 1.5 million in the December quarter, including initial shipments of our 10-terabyte drive, our third-generation helium drive. First shipped by Western Digital in 2013, we are pleased with the success and wider adoption of helium technology in enterprise IT, as it marks the shift for hard drive makers to deliver value-added storage solutions to customers based on a value proposition of better total cost of ownership.
Our Enterprise SSD revenue grew to $270 million in the December quarter. While we continue to believe Enterprise SSD will be one of our main growth drivers, we expect to see a pause in our growth in the March quarter, given typical seasonal factors in enterprise IT spending and as we proceed through a SAS product transition. And we continue to see good traction in our Active Archive systems business, with several wins in Tier 2 cloud infrastructure, backup and archive applications and other vertical markets. 
Regarding the SanDisk acquisition. We are pleased with the progress we are  making in obtaining required regulatory approvals. It has always been our goal to close the acquisition as soon as possible, and as noted in our Form 8-K filing earlier this month, we have competed the FTC review in the U.S. I would also note that the FTC completed its review without issuing a second request, which we see as confirmation of our view that this transaction is pro-competitive. We have also received recent approvals from antitrust agencies in Singapore and Japan. Based on our work with other agencies around the world, we currently anticipate that the acquisition will close in the June quarter.
I would like to emphasize the importance of the acquisition of SanDisk to our overall strategic plan. Once we close the acquisition, we will have the broadest set of products to offer our customers, a deep technology base across nonvolatile memory and rotating magnetic media and an expanded addressable market. 
On the Unisplendour investment, we and Unisplendour continue to work with CFIUS as they review the proposed investment in Western Digital. CFIUS has not yet reached a decision on whether the investment is a covered transaction. We continue to believe that we have structured this investment carefully in order to avoid that result. Given CFIUS' heavy caseload towards the end of last year, we asked to withdraw and refile our notice in order to provide additional time for us to engage with them on our case. CFIUS agreed to our request, and we refiled in January. We now expect A decision from CFIUS sometime in February. Our strategic joint venture with Unisplendour to sell our storage systems in Japan (sic) [ China ] is proceeding as planned. We successfully negotiated its terms, including operational and governance plans in late 2015. And with those complete, we are now in the process of satisfying certain closing conditions while simultaneously recruiting and staffing the JV.
I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. 
Olivier will now provide his commentary before we take your questions."

We shipped a total of 49.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.5%, and operating expenses totaled $542 million. Non-GAAP tax expense for the December quarter was $21 million or 5% of non-GAAP pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $374 million or $1.60 per share. In the December quarter, we generated $598 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $449 million. Our CapEx totaled $149 million or 4% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was held in the U.S. 
I will now provide an update regarding the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. All of my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. To remind everyone, we previously indicated that we would realize $400 million of operating expense savings. We also said we would achieve additional meaningful savings from reductions in cost of goods sold. 
Finally, we indicated these savings would be obtained over a 1- to 2-years period. There are 3 main components in realizing these savings, including: asset and footprint reduction; product roadmap consolidation; and organization rationalization. During our last earnings call, we also mentioned that the quarterly baseline for operating expenses is $570 million from which these cost savings should be calculated. 
Following our initial integration planning, we continue to expect to realize $400 million of operating expense reduction per year on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. The cost of goods sold, we expect to realize $250 million of synergy per year on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. This would give us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We expect to achieve 50% of the synergy run rate by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. We currently estimate cash cost to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. This estimate will continue to be refined as we finalize our cost reduction efforts. Finally, we expect about 75% of this cost to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.
Moving on to our guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our December quarter, operating expenses of approximately $500 million, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30.

Let me address the first part of that question. One of the things I think that is important to emphasize is that when we evaluated the merits of doing the SanDisk transaction, there's a number of things that we looked at. One is, is that we did -- we looked at various different scenarios from a business performance level. And we expected and anticipated that there could be some increased volatility from a market perspective, both from a macro perspective as well as volatility as it relates to supply/demand dynamics in demand market. So we have stressed cases, we have base case scenarios, we also had bull case scenarios. And in all those scenarios, the transaction proved to be value creating for our shareholders longer term, so we're very confident in that regard. Additionally, as we approach the end of the year, we all know that we were looking at the potential for an increasing rate environment here in the U.S. So we factored in some expectation of rate increases in terms of that portion of our financing that would be affected by rate increases. And again, those rate increases, to date, have been within our expectations and we're confident that, that will remain the case. Additionally, the other thing that we've talked about is -- and there is additional detail to some degree in our S-4 filing, is that we expect to quickly deleverage our debt to the tune of specifically $3 million within a short period -- $3 billion -- sorry, $3 billion within a short period of time after the closing of the transaction. That deleveraging will incur in those areas in the market where we are more exposed to interest rate exposure.

There -- the one thing that -- the biggest drag in terms of near term on our gross margins, if you want to call it that -- I mean, let's be honest, we still continue to have strong gross margin performance, but has been weaker enterprise volumes. And it really has to do with what Mike was talking about in that the first half of calendar year 2015 had a higher mix of enterprise volumes, and then there was an absorption of that, those drives in the back half, we will see that kind of flip and go to normal seasonality in calendar year '16. So all things remaining equal, we should see our margins begin to benefit from that higher gross margin level as we exit calendar year 2016. But of course, there can be other factors, including pricing, which can impact things, there can be total volumes.

After my opening remarks, Olivier give additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. He will also provide an update on savings associated with the integration of our HGST and WD subsidiaries.
I am pleased to report that our plan to close the SanDisk acquisition in the June quarter is on track having received shareholder approval in March and having obtained the committed debt financing associated with the transaction earlier this month. We continue to work constructively with China's Ministry of Commerce on its review of the acquisition. The last remaining regulatory approval required to close the SanDisk acquisition.
Subject to gaining MOFCOM approval and closing the acquisition shortly thereafter, we plan to provide the investment community with an update to the standalone guidance we are providing today to reflect the partial period of ownership of the SanDisk business in the June quarter.
Aggregate demand for hard drives in the March quarter was generally consistent with our expectations. We anticipate that hard drive demand in the June quarter will be slightly down from the March quarter giving continued, softer PC demand and weaker-than-expected demand and performance enterprise. We believe we have the ability to increase our gross margins sequentially in the June quarter by continuing to take cost out of the business through our ongoing and unique integration activities of the HGST and WD subsidiaries and through our focus on optimizing our market position and product portfolio mix.
We continue to manage our business effectively in a dynamic storage demand environment. Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices, storage technologies and PCs continue to evolve and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures.
It's worth noting that as companies evaluate the shift to cloud computing, they're carefully managing their IT spending, affecting both client and enterprise-related purchases in the near term. In the meantime, the creation of data and the amount of it being stored continues to grow, underpinning a promising, long-term growth opportunity in the storage industry. Our strategy to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions anticipates these and other trends.
After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities with the industry's broadest set of storage solutions, a rich technology portfolio and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and nonvolatile memory.
Olivier will now provide details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter.

Our revenue for the March quarter was $2.8 billion. We shipped a total of 43.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.1% and operating expenses totaled $477 million.
Non-GAAP tax expense for the March quarter was $26 million or 8% of non-GAAP pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $283 million or $1.21 per share.
In the March quarter, we generated $485 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $352 million. Our CapEx totaled $133 million or 5% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which approximately $400 million was held in the U.S.
I will now provide an update on cost-savings initiative as the result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. This information is also provided in our quarterly fact sheet, posted on our website. All my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. As a reminder, we provided our initial estimate of these savings on our last earnings conference call in late January.
Based on our ongoing integration activity, we are revising our associated savings and cost estimates. We now expect to achieve total savings of $800 million on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2017, versus the $650 million estimated previously. Specifically, savings from operating expenses are now expected to be $450 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which 2/3 will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This would result in a new OpEx run rate of $460 million per quarter exiting 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $400 million OpEx savings with 50-50 split between the 2 years and a run rate of $470 million per quarter exiting 2017.
For cost of goods sold, we now expect to achieve $350 million of savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which 50% will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of 2017, with a 50-50 split between the 2 years. As a reminder, these savings will provide us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. 
We continue to estimate cash expense to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. We now expect 60% of these expenses to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. This timing compares with our earlier estimate of 75% being incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.
Moving on to our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our March quarter. Operating expenses of approximately $475 million. Excluding the impact due to the interest expense from debt financing related to the SanDisk acquisition, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1 and $1.10. As Steve mentioned, we look forward to providing you with an update of today's standalone guidance to reflect the anticipated partial ownership of SanDisk indigent quarter.

I'll comment on it and then Mike Cordano might want to add a little bit as well as we go through. From a demand perspective, as I indicated, from an aggregate-demand perspective, things came in pretty much the way that we had expected, right? We had called a 100 unit TAM and came in at whatever 99.8, that's our estimate, right. We haven't seen Toshiba's numbers yet. And within that, I would say that the PC market obviously, remains weak and a bit weaker than what we expected. Now that being said, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself, we had hedged that a little bit because we been pretty bearish in the PC market for a while. Clearly, the PC market remains a bit weaker than what we expected. I would say that from a demand perspective that the area of, if you want to it biggest surprise, was that performance enterprise was weaker than we expected. Mike might comment a little bit on what we're seeing thereafter I kind of get a view on what we saw from a pricing perspective. And then there were some other areas that we're may be kind of slightly better than what we expected, where in aggregate it came out to kind of 100 million unit TAM number. Now from a pricing perspective, kind of a mixed bag there. On the positive side, we were able to increase our pricing in the 2.5-inch market, both oriented towards notebook as well as in gaming. So we were able to increase our prices and those price increases have stuck and are reflected in our go-forward estimates as it relates to our financials. On the negative side is that we saw steeper than anticipated price declines in the enterprise market, both in performance enterprise and even more specifically, in Capacity Enterprise and to be even more specific on that, in the 4 8 terabyte capacity points. And you can see that if you look at our margins, where they were short of our expectations and we were down quarter-on-quarter, that is directly correlated to what we saw from a pricing perspective. And by the way, further to that, we actually lost share in the enterprise market as we chose not to participate in some of those more steeper declines from a pricing perspective. Now what we're doing as a consequence to that is that we're taking the action from our standpoint because we want to make sure that we've got sufficient dollars to reinvest back into our business to continue to innovate and provide compelling products for our customers, we are making selective price increases in certain enterprise markets. At this point, we're not sure if they're going to stick, but we're certainly hoping that they do. And with that, I'll ask Mike to comment a bit on performance enterprise demand dynamics."

And if you think about it as those performance enterprise drives that sell into the storage system marketplaces versus the server marketplace, what we have seen for some time is the decline in 15,000 RPM that continues, that trend down continues. We are now seeing some more trending down happening in the 10K market quarter-over-quarter. But the pronounced reduction we see is really in the storage segment of the marketplace. I think that's reflected in what we see people doing with all flash arrays and whatnot. So going forward, we think we'll see accelerating trend, downward trends, within the storage segment, but a more stable profile within the server segment. And we'll be, as Steve said, looking the way that portfolio shapes up and position ourselves appropriately."

Now the one thing I should point out, we discussed this last time, is calendar '15 was inverted relative to seasonality stronger in the first half, weaker in the second. This year is more traditional seasonality, where we expect strength in the backend of the year and that's further supported by what a number of the hyperscale companies I've talked about relative to expected CapEx. So that growth remains as expected. The softness and capacity shipments really is across the other markets, led by the PC market as well as this news that we discussed today on performance enterprise."

We've got some other puts and takes in terms of normal seasonal trends that we see from a Q1 to Q2. But the primary reason for that decline is really those 2 factors that I called out. The other thing that I would add to that is that if you go back to our prior conference call, we had anticipated that the March quarter would be the low point of the year from a TAM perspective. Obviously, that had not borne itself out assuming that TAM turns out to be in 95 million. And the primary reason for that is again because of weaker PC sales and softer demand for performance, for traditional performance enterprise hard drives."

So if you think about a PC, most often that's a single simple storage device and there's going to be a selection made between HD or an SSD. So the trends there relative to SSD penetration, we've been tracking them for some time in the SSD versus PC outlook or [indiscernible] mid-30s[ph] in terms of penetration, that's continuing to track in a way that we've anticipated. So we don't see anything unusual there happening with that, although we do believe that trend will continue. Within the enterprise segment, it's a very different dynamic. It's really based on workload, it's based on where cost is driven on a cost per IO basis, flash becomes a more attractive option. I talked earlier about where the displacement is happening with performance enterprise, it's primarily in 2 spots. One is when you put it into an array form, so the traditional storage systems area and that's where you can get a more efficient cost per IO across that total infrastructure system infrastructure. So it's not really based upon a storage capacity metric, it's based on looking at the workloads, looking at where we need to optimize I/O versus storage. So it's a different set of calculus, it's not a 1 1 replacement, either, given these dynamics. So we do see that trend happening in a different way in the storage systems area. Moving into service, it follows something closer to the PC model where you have low-end and midrange servers that tend to have a number of storage devices and it tends to be price point related. So you match the CPUs, the memory and the storage performance in a way to deliver a price and value proposition. So that marketplace will more closely follow the way the PC marketplace is going. And frankly, it will go at a slower trajectory. So we don't see that kind of impact in the server marketplace relative to SSD replacement that we see in the storage systems market."

But what's important relative to what we're doing and it really speaks to the importance of having this integration opportunity as it relates to WD and HGST as well as the acquisition of SanDisk is that you have the optionality or ability to maneuver around the rate and pace issue that sometimes present themselves to, for example, take cost out faster than you need to a legacy businesses and also shift over to newer technologies quicker. And so with the changes that we're making and the options that we have, we'll be able to modulate not only those trends but the rate and pace issue, which is more difficult to predict as we move forward. So we think it's very important to recognize that in terms of our ability to be able to do with those changes."

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. He will also provide an update on savings associated with the integration of our HGST and WD subsidiaries.
I am pleased to report that our plan to close the SanDisk acquisition in the June quarter is on track, having received shareholder approval in March and having obtained the committed debt financing associated with the transaction earlier this month. We continue to work constructively with China's Ministry of Commerce on its review of the acquisition, the last remaining regulatory approval required to close the SanDisk acquisition. Subject to gaining MOFCOM approval and closing the acquisition shortly thereafter, we plan to provide the investment community with an update to the stand-alone guidance we are providing today to reflect the partial period of ownership of the SanDisk business in the June quarter.
Aggregate demand for hard drives in the March quarter was generally consistent with our expectations. We anticipate that hard drive demand in the June quarter will be slightly down from the March quarter given continued, softer PC demand and weaker-than-expected demand in performance enterprise. We believe we have the ability to increase our gross margins sequentially in the June quarter by continuing to take cost out of the business through our ongoing and unique integration activities of the HGST and WD subsidiaries and through our focus on optimizing our market position and product portfolio mix.
We continue to manage our business effectively in a dynamic storage demand environment. Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices. Storage technologies and PCs continue to evolve, and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures. It's worth noting that as companies evaluate the shift to cloud computing, they're carefully managing their IT spending, affecting both client and enterprise-related purchases in the near term. 
In the meantime, the creation of data and the amount of it being stored continues to grow, underpinning a promising, long-term growth opportunity in the storage industry. Our strategy, to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions, anticipates these and other trends. After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities with the industry's broadest set of storage solutions, a rich technology portfolio and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and nonvolatile memory.
Olivier will now provide details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter.

We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which approximately $400 million was held in the U.S.
I will now provide an update on cost-savings initiative as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. This information is also provided in our quarterly fact sheet posted on our website. All my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. As a reminder, we provided our initial estimate of these savings on our last earnings conference call in late January.
Based on our ongoing integration activity, we are revising our associated savings and cost estimates. We now expect to achieve total savings of $800 million on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2017 versus the $650 million estimated previously. Specifically, savings from operating expenses are now expected to be $450 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which 2/3 will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This would result in a new OpEx run rate of $460 million per quarter exiting 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $400 million OpEx savings with 50-50 split between the 2 years and a run rate of $470 million per quarter exiting 2017.
For cost of goods sold, we now expect to achieve $350 million of savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which 50% will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of 2017, with a 50-50 split between the 2 years. As a reminder, these savings will provide us with the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. 
We continue to estimate cash expense to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. We now expect 60% of these expenses to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. This timing compares with our earlier estimate of 75% being incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.
Moving on to our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our March quarter, operating expenses of approximately $475 million. Excluding the impact due to the interest expense from debt financing related to the SanDisk acquisition, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1 and $1.10. As Steve mentioned, we look forward to providing you with an update of today's stand-alone guidance to reflect the anticipated partial period of ownership of SanDisk in the June quarter.
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

I'll comment on it, and then Mike Cordano may want to add a little bit as well as we go through. From a demand perspective, as I indicated, from an aggregate-demand perspective, things came in pretty much the way that we had expected, right? We had called a 100 million-unit TAM and came in at, whatever, 99.8 million. That's our estimate, right? We haven't seen Toshiba's numbers yet. And within that, I would say that the PC market obviously, remains weak and a bit weaker than what we expected. Now that being said, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself, we had hedged that a little bit because we've been pretty bearish on the PC market for a while. But clearly, the PC market remains a bit weaker than what we expected. I would say that from a demand perspective that the area of, if you want to it biggest surprise, was that performance enterprise was weaker than we expected. Mike can comment a little bit on what we're seeing thereafter I kind of give a view on what we saw from a pricing perspective. And then there were some other areas that were, maybe, kind of slightly better than what we expected, where in aggregate, it came out to kind of 100 million-unit TAM number. Now from a pricing perspective, kind of a mixed bag there. On the positive side, we were able to increase our pricing in the 2.5-inch market, both oriented towards notebook as well as in gaming. So we were able to increase our prices, and those price increases have stuck and are reflected in our go-forward estimates as it relates to our financials. On the negative side is that we saw steeper-than-anticipated price declines in the enterprise market, both in performance enterprise and even more specifically, in capacity enterprise and to be even more specific on that, in the 4, 8 terabyte capacity points. And you can see that if you look at our margins, where they were short of our expectations and we were down quarter-on-quarter, that is directly correlated to what we saw from a pricing perspective. And by the way, further to that, we actually lost share in the enterprise market as we chose not to participate in some of those more steeper declines from a pricing perspective. Now what we're doing as a consequence to that is that we're taking the action from our standpoint, because we want to make sure that we've got sufficient dollars to reinvest back into our business to continue to innovate and provide compelling products for our customers, we are making selective price increases in certain enterprise markets. And at this point, we're not sure if they're going to stick, but we're certainly hoping that they do. And with that, I'll ask Mike to comment a bit on performance enterprise demand dynamics."

And if you think about it as those performance enterprise drives that sell into the storage system marketplaces versus the server marketplace, what we have seen for some time is the decline in 15,000 RPM. That continues. That trend down continues. We are now seeing some more trending down happening in the 10k market quarter-over-quarter. But the pronounced reduction we see is really in the storage segment of the marketplace. I think that's reflected in what we see people doing with all-flash arrays and whatnot. So going forward, we think we'll see accelerating trend, downward trends within the storage segment, but a more stable profile within the server segment. And we'll be, as Steve said, looking at the way that portfolio shapes up and positioning ourselves appropriately."

This year is more traditional seasonality, where we expect strength in the back end of the year, and that's further supported by, what, a number of the hyperscale companies have talked about relative to expected CapEx. So that growth remains as expected. The softness and capacity shipments really is across the other markets, led by the PC market as well as this new news that we discussed today on performance enterprise."

The other thing that I would add to that is that if you go back to our prior conference call, we had anticipated that the March quarter would be the low point of the year from a TAM perspective.

I mean, the first thing is, no, we have not begun any qualification or integration-related activities for our products. And I think it's important that to note that, obviously, we continue to operate as 2 separate companies. And so that would be inappropriate for us to be engaging in that kind of activity at this point. Now relative to the timing, let me make a few comments on that. From a financial perspective, when we talked about the financial synergies that we expected to realize, there was some timing that was wrapped around that. There's no changing -- there's no change in terms of the expectation as it relates to that timing, so that remains consistent. Obviously, we'll update the investment community as we move forward on how that timing may change, et cetera. But there are multiple considerations that we have to think about. Obviously, the most important thing is that we want to execute the transition in a way that makes the most sense for our partners. And from -- so that's our customers as well as our relationship with Intel. We've enjoyed a very strong relationship with Intel over a period of time, and we want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that makes the most sense for all of the parties involved. So that will take some time, and we do believe that when we talk about the financial synergies that we would realize, that we factored in appropriately those time considerations in our thinking."

So if you think about a PC, it has -- most often, it has a single storage device, and there's going to be a selection made between a HDD or an SSD. So the trends there relative to SSD penetration, we've been tracking them for some time. In the SSD versus PC outlook, we're in the mid-30s in terms of penetration. That's continuing to track in a way that we've anticipated. So we don't see anything unusual there happening with that, although we do believe the trend will continue. Within the enterprise segment, it's a very different dynamic. It's really based on workload and it's based on where cost is driven on a cost per I/O basis. Flash becomes a more attractive option. I talked earlier about where the displacement is happening with performance enterprise. It's primarily in 2 spots: One is when you put it into an array form, so the traditional storage system area, and that's where you can get a more efficient cost per I/O across total infrastructure system infrastructure. So it's not really based upon a storage capacity metric. It's based on looking at the workloads, looking at where we need to optimize I/O versus storage. So it's a different set of calculus. It's not a 1 for 1 replacement either, given these dynamics. So we do see that trend happening in a different way in the storage systems area. Moving into servers, it follows something closer to the PC model, where you have low-end and midrange servers that tend to have a number of storage devices, and it tends to be price point related. So you match the CPU, the memory and the storage performance in a way to deliver a price and value proposition. So that marketplace will more closely follow the way the PC marketplace is going. And frankly, it will go at a slower trajectory. So we don't see the kind of impact in the server marketplace relative to SSD replacement that we see in the storage systems market."

But what's important relative to what we're doing, and it really speaks to the importance of having this integration opportunity as it relates to WD and HGST as well as with the acquisition of SanDisk, is that you have the optionality or the ability to maneuver around the rate and pace issues that sometimes present themselves to, for example, take cost out faster than you need to in legacy businesses and also shift over to newer technologies quicker. And so with the changes that we're making and the options that we have, we'll be able to modulate, not only those trends, but the rate and pace issue, which is more difficult to predict as we move forward. So we think it's very important to recognize that in terms of our ability to be able to deal with those changes."

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. He will also provide an update on savings associated with the integration of our HGST and WD subsidiaries.
I am pleased to report that our plan to close the SanDisk acquisition in the June quarter is on track, having received shareholder approval in March and having obtained the committed debt financing associated with the transaction earlier this month. We continue to work constructively with China's Ministry of Commerce on its review of the acquisition, the last remaining regulatory approval required to close the SanDisk acquisition. Subject to gaining MOFCOM approval and closing the acquisition shortly thereafter, we plan to provide the investment community with an update to the stand-alone guidance we are providing today to reflect the partial period of ownership of the SanDisk business in the June quarter.
Aggregate demand for hard drives in the March quarter was generally consistent with our expectations. We anticipate that hard drive demand in the June quarter will be slightly down from the March quarter given continued, softer PC demand and weaker-than-expected demand in performance enterprise. We believe we have the ability to increase our gross margins sequentially in the June quarter by continuing to take cost out of the business through our ongoing and unique integration activities of the HGST and WD subsidiaries and through our focus on optimizing our market position and product portfolio mix.
We continue to manage our business effectively in a dynamic storage demand environment. Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices. Storage technologies and PCs continue to evolve, and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures. It's worth noting that as companies evaluate the shift to cloud computing, they are carefully managing their IT spending, affecting both client and enterprise-related purchases in the near term. 
In the meantime, the creation of data and the amount of it being stored continues to grow, underpinning a promising, long-term growth opportunity in the storage industry. Our strategy, to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions, anticipates these and other trends. After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities with the industry's broadest set of storage solutions, a rich technology portfolio and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and nonvolatile memory.
Olivier will now provide details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter.

Our revenue for the March quarter was $2.8 billion. We shipped a total of 43.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.1% and operating expenses totaled $477 million. Non-GAAP tax expense",578,"Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the March quarter was $2.8 billion. We shipped a total of 43.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.1% and operating expenses totaled $477 million. Non-GAAP tax expense for the March quarter was $26 million or 8% of non-GAAP pretax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $283 million or $1.21 per share.
In the March quarter, we generated $485 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $352 million. Our CapEx totaled $133 million or 5% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which approximately $400 million was held in the U.S.
I will now provide an update on cost-savings initiatives as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. This information is also provided in our quarterly fact sheet posted on our website. All my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. As a reminder, we provided our initial estimate of these savings on our last earnings conference call in late January.
Based on our ongoing integration activity, we are revising our associated savings and cost estimates. We now expect to achieve total savings of $800 million on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2017 versus the $650 million estimated previously. Specifically, savings from operating expenses are now expected to be $450 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which 2/3 will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This would result in a new OpEx run rate of $460 million per quarter exiting 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $400 million OpEx savings with 50-50 split between the 2 years and a run rate of $470 million per quarter exiting 2017.
For cost of goods sold, we now expect to achieve $350 million of savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which 50% will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of 2017, with a 50-50 split between the 2 years. As a reminder, these savings will provide us with the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. 
We continue to estimate cash expense to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. We now expect 60% of these expenses to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. This timing compares with our earlier estimate of 75% being incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.
Moving on to our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our March quarter, operating expenses of approximately $475 million. Excluding the impact due to the interest expense from debt financing related to the SanDisk acquisition, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1 and $1.10. As Steve mentioned, we look forward to providing you with an update of today's stand-alone guidance to reflect the anticipated partial period of ownership of SanDisk in the June quarter.

I'll comment on it, and then Mike Cordano may want to add a little bit as well as we go through. From a demand perspective, as I indicated, from an aggregate demand perspective, things came in pretty much the way that we had expected, right? We had called a 100 million-unit TAM and came in at, whatever, 99.8 million. That's our estimate, right? We haven't seen Toshiba's numbers yet. And within that, I would say that the PC market, obviously, remains weak and a bit weaker than what we expected. Now that being said, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself, we had hedged that a little bit because we've been pretty bearish on the PC market for a while. But clearly, the PC market remains a bit weaker than what we expected. I would say that from a demand perspective that the area of, if you want to it biggest surprise, was that performance enterprise was weaker than we expected. Mike can comment a little bit on what we're seeing there, after I kind of give a view on what we saw from a pricing perspective. And then there were some other areas that were, maybe, kind of slightly better than what we expected, where in aggregate, it came out to kind of a 100 million-unit TAM number. Now from a pricing perspective, kind of a mixed bag there. On the positive side, we were able to increase our pricing in the 2.5-inch market, both oriented towards notebook as well as in gaming. So we were able to increase our prices, and those price increases have stuck and are reflected in our go-forward estimates as it relates to our financials. On the negative side is that we saw steeper-than-anticipated price declines in the enterprise market, both in performance enterprise and even more specifically, in capacity enterprise and to be even more specific on that, in the 4, 8 terabyte capacity points. And you can see that if you look at our margins, where they were short of our expectations and we were down quarter-on-quarter, that is directly correlated to what we saw from a pricing perspective. And by the way, further to that, we actually lost share in the enterprise market as we chose not to participate in some of those more -- steeper declines from a pricing perspective. Now what we're doing as a consequence of that is that we're taking the action from our standpoint, because we want to make sure that we've got sufficient dollars to reinvest back into our business to continue to innovate and provide compelling products for our customers, we are making selected price increases in certain enterprise markets. And at this point, we're not sure if they're going to stick, but we're certainly hoping that they do. And with that, I'll ask Mike to comment a bit on performance enterprise demand dynamics."

And if you think about it as those performance enterprise drives that sell into the storage system marketplaces versus the server marketplace, what we have seen for some time is the decline in 15,000 RPM. That continues. That trend down continues. We are now seeing some more trending down happening in the 10k market quarter-over-quarter. But the pronounced reduction that we see is really in the storage segment of the marketplace. I think that's reflected in what we see people doing with all-flash arrays and whatnot. So going forward, we think we'll see accelerating trend -- downward trends within the storage segment, but a more stable profile within the server segment.

So I'm just wondering, could you just talk about what's happening within that segment? And how do you see that transpire for the rest of the year?"

From a financial perspective, when we talked about the financial synergies that we expected to realize, there was some timing that was wrapped around that. There's no changing -- there's no change in terms of the expectation as it relates to that timing, so that remains consistent. Obviously, we'll update the investment community as we move forward on how that timing may change, et cetera. But there are multiple considerations that we have to think about. Obviously, the most important thing is, is that we want to execute the transition in a way that makes the most sense for our partners. And from a -- so that's our customers as well as our relationship with Intel. We've enjoyed a very strong relationship with Intel over a period of time, and we want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that makes the most sense for all of the parties involved. So that will take some time, and we do believe that when we talked about the financial synergies that we would realize, that we factored in appropriately those time considerations in our thinking."

So if you think about a PC, it has -- most often, it has a single storage device and there's going to be a selection made between an HDD or an SSD. So the trends there relative to SSD penetration, we've been tracking them for some time. In the SSD versus PC outlook, we're in the mid-30s in terms of penetration. That's continuing to track in a way that we've anticipated. So we don't see anything unusual there happening with that, although we do believe the trend will continue. Within the enterprise segment, it's a very different dynamic. It's really based on workload and it's based on where cost is driven on a cost per I/O basis. Flash becomes a more attractive option. I talked earlier about where the displacement is happening with performance enterprise. It's primarily in 2 spots: One is when you put it into an array form, so the traditional storage systems area, and that's where you can get a more efficient cost per I/O across total infrastructure, system infrastructure. So it's not really based upon a storage capacity metric. It's based on looking at the workloads, looking at where we need to optimize I/O versus storage. So it's a different set of calculus. It's not a 1 for 1 replacement either, given these dynamics. So we do see that trend happening in a different way in the storage systems area. Moving into servers, it follows something closer to the PC model, where you have low-end and midrange servers that tend to have a number of storage devices, and it tends to be price point related. So you match the CPU, the memory and the storage performance in a way to deliver a price and value proposition. So that marketplace will more closely follow the way the PC marketplace is going. And frankly, it will go at a slower trajectory. So we don't see the kind of impact in the server marketplace relative to SSD replacement that we see in the storage systems market."

But what's important relative to what we're doing, and it really speaks to the importance of having this integration opportunity as it relates to WD and HGST as well as with the acquisition of SanDisk, is that you have the optionality or the ability to maneuver around the rate and pace issues that sometimes present themselves to, for example, take cost out faster than you need to in legacy businesses and also shift over to newer technologies quicker. And so with the changes that we're making and the options that we have, we'll be able to modulate, not only those trends, but the rate and pace issue, which is more difficult to predict as we move forward. So we think it's very important to recognize that in terms of our ability to be able to deal with those changes."

With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier  Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Wong, Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer.
After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter.
Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets.
Given unabated growth and data and the increasing world technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the marketplace. We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer-driven organization and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution.
I am pleased to report that our integration activities, associated with our acquisitions, are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity focused on addressing the tremendous growth in data and the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet. We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology roadmaps involving legacy WD, HGST and SanDisk's product and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the new fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership. We announced our next-generation 3D NAND technology, [indiscernible], with an industry-leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability, pilot production of [indiscernible] 3 has commenced and we expect a meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017.
And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition. We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile and addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and the positive spirit of our employees and a favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers.
I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations."

I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device and client solution markets. We have been providing our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision.
Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling in aligning the various product roadmaps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed timeline. We have identified key leaders for our various functions and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees. Coupled with the series of restructuring actions we have taken over the last 2 years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in response with the closure of 2 facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore.
Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we reduce our overall facility's footprints by almost 1/5 and our headcount by almost 1/4 over the last 2 fiscal years.
Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results. In HD, we achieved XY growth of 12% on a year-on-year basis, primarily driven by shipments of our Capacity Enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth within our Capacity Enterprise product line was 47% on a year-on-year basis, faster than the market growth rate, thanks to the ongoing success of our helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10-terabyte product to high volume, our third-generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generation of advantage and already created significant marketplace momentum. Enterprise SSDs, we saw a strength in sales in both enterprise and in cloud customers.
From a client device perspective, we are benefiting from the growth -- growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HD unit shipments declined year-over-year.
In our other flash-related business as we saw broad-based trend across several key markets and our operational execution was strong across-the-board. Our industry-leading 50-nanometer technology remain the workhorse and has accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 50-nanometer technology set another record and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in key markets we serve.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next-generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our 3 bit per cell or X3 architecture delivering the industry's smallest 256-gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost reduction capabilities beyond our 50-nanometer[ph] node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3  instead of BiCS2, and this will allow us to rapidly convert our next-generation 3D NAND technology in 2017.
Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology have a long tail as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets.
From a wafer fab standpoint in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us a slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the plan mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies for the rest of the year, we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimated for a total industry bit supply growth as we have previously indicated. However, as we look to 2017, the plan rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enabled the mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry.
Switching to the near term. We believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following: New product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business, along with the seasonality; additionally SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs even as PC unit volume shrink; we are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology; and we are experiencing stronger demand and non-SSD flash market, such as mobile, and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business. 
Offsetting these factors, we have seen share driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. This include the low end of the 2.5-inch HD market and the 8-terabyte capacity point in Capacity Enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas.
Our fiscal Q4 performance and forward guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account.
To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is in a very unique in our industry, a combination of WD, HGST and SanDisk has allowed us methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business.
With that, I will turn the call over Olivier to review our Q4 financial results."

This is an exciting time for me to lead the company in this new role and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I've been with the company and in the industry for many years. Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward.
With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies. 
Today, we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet consistent with our value creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of 3 primary end markets: 1, data center devices and solutions; 2, client devices; and 3, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these 3 end markets. 
Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value, including revenue and exabyte shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mixed up strategies for our NAND and HDD products, respectively. We have discontinued providing the follow information in the quarterly fact sheet: Revenue from top 10 customers, enterprise SSDs and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business. 
As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today. 
In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary with the operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market, our value creation drivers and historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for a transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year. 
At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deeper understanding and discussion of our business. 
I'd like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance cost over the term of the debt and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million[ph] each quarter thereafter over the next 5 years. This debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make. 
Second, through the purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cost related to these yen second hedges. 
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.

So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instrument. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gain. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would have a benefit of $26 million. And in fiscal Q2, we would have a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for you have the change in reporting due to purchase accounting. With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms."

I have no -- nothing to report in terms of the status of that other than we're currently in discussions with them. The additional point that I will make when we talk about part of acquisition is that when we did our forward modeling of the impact of that, we were, I will call it relatively conservative in terms of our assumptions. And so we did not get overly aggressive as to what we thought. So we feel like we're sufficiently protected in terms of how that might turn out from future financial modded perspective."

One thing that Mike said, we have been very aggressive over a period of time taking capacity out both in the form of brick-and-mortar as well as in terms of headcount to react to the decline that we've seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers we've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our headcount over the course of the last 2 years. We also have -- we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to 1/3 and when you look at from 2 years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can. Obviously, our margins in terms of what you reported on the hard drive size that we've done pretty good our side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. And I have no doubt that will continue to do that going forward. In terms of your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase on is really a couple of different things. One there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx, but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior -- for fiscal Q4."

With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier  Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer.After my opening remark",525,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier  Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer.
After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights. Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials, and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter.
Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets.
Given the unabated growth in data and the increasing role technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the marketplace. We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer-driven organization, and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution.
I am pleased to report that our integration activities associated with our acquisitions are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity focused on addressing the tremendous growth of data and the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet.
We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology road maps involving legacy WD, HGST and SanDisk products, and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the new fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership. We announced our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, with an industry-leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability. Pilot production of BiCS3 has commenced, and we expect  meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017. And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition.
We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile in addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and positive spirit of our employees and the favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers.
I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition.

I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device and client solution markets. We have been combining our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision.
Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling and aligning the various product road maps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed time line. We have identified key leaders for our various functions, and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees. Coupled with a series of restructuring actions we have taken over the last 2 years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in recent months with the closure of 2 facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore.
Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we have reduced our overall facility's footprints by almost 1/5 and our headcount by almost 1/4 over the last 2 fiscal years.
Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results. In HDDs, we achieved overall exabyte growth of 12% on a year-on-year basis primarily driven by shipments of our Capacity Enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth within our Capacity Enterprise product line was 47% on a year-on-year basis, faster than the market growth rate, thanks to the ongoing success of our helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10-terabyte product to high volume, our third-generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generational advantage and has already created significant marketplace momentum. At enterprise SSDs, we saw a strength in sales in both enterprise and in cloud customers.
From a client device's perspective, we are benefiting from the growth -- growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HD unit shipments declined year-over-year.
In our other flash-related businesses, we saw a broad-based strength across several key markets, and our operational execution was strong across the board. Our industry-leading 50-nanometer technology remained the workhorse, and it accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 50-nanometer technology set another record, and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in the key markets we serve.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next-generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our 3-bit per cell or X3 architecture delivering the industry's smallest 256-gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost-reduction capabilities beyond our 50-nanometer node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3 instead of BiCS2, and this will allow us to rapidly convert to our next-generation 3D NAND technology in 2017. Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology to have a long tail as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets.
From a wafer fab standpoint in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the planned mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies for the rest of the year, we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimate for a total industry bit supply growth as we have previously indicated. However, as we look to 2017, the planned rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enable the mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry.
Switching to the near term. We believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following: new product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business, along with the seasonality; additionally, SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs even as PC unit volume shrink; we are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology; and we are experiencing stronger demand in non-SSD flash market such as mobile and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business.
Offsetting these factors, we have seen share-driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. These include the low end of the 2.5-inch HDD market and the 8-terabyte capacity point in Capacity Enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas.
Our fiscal Q4 performance and forward guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account.
To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is in a -- very unique in our industry. The combination of WD, HGST and SanDisk has allowed us to methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business.
With that, I will turn the call over Olivier to review our Q4 financial results."

This is an exciting time for me to be leading the company in this new role, and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I've been with the company and in the industry for many years.
Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward. With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling, long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies.
Today, we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet, consistent with our value creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of 3 primary end markets: one, data center devices and solutions; two, client devices; and three, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these 3 end markets.
Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value, including revenue and exabyte shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mixed up strategies for our NAND and HDD products, respectively. We have discontinued providing the following information in the quarterly fact sheet: revenue from top 10 customers, enterprise SSDs and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business.
As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today.
In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary on key operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market, our value creation drivers and historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for a transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year.
At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics, including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow, for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deep understanding and discussion of our business.
I would like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance cost over the term of the debt, and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million each quarter thereafter over the next 5 years. These debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make.
Second, through the purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cash related to these yen hedges.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90.

So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instrument. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gain. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would've had a benefit of $26 million, and in fiscal Q2, we would've had a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for you the change in reporting due to purchase accounting. With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms."

It's our job from the management perspective to manage that volatility and to reduce its impact on our P&L, on our balance sheet and corresponding impact on shareholders. So a fluctuation in the yen, just like changes in other variables that we deal with, our job is to manage that. By the way, absent the impact, I don't say absent, but even with the impact of purchase accounting, we're able to offset largely the impact in terms of the change in the value of the yen on our first quarter results, and I think it's important to emphasize that fact."

The additional thing is that the current royalty arrangement is up for renewal, and we're in discussions with Samsung regarding the terms of that renewal. I have no -- nothing to report in terms of the status of that other than we're currently in discussions with them. And then the additional point that I will make which we talked about as part of the acquisition is that when we did our forward modeling of the impact of that, we were, I will call it, relatively conservative in terms of our assumptions. And so we did not get overly aggressive as to what we thought. So we feel like we're sufficiently protected in terms of how that might turn out from a future financial modeling perspective."

One of the things that Mike said is we have been very aggressive over a period of time of taking capacity out, both in the form of brick-and-mortar as well as in terms of headcount to react to the decline that we've seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers. We've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our headcount over the course of the last 2 years. We also have -- we're -- we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to 1/3 and when you look at from 2 years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can. Obviously, our margins in terms of what we reported on the hard drive size shows that we've done a pretty good job of managing the cost side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. I have no doubt that we'll continue to do that going forward. In terms of the -- your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase is really a couple of different things. One, there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior -- for fiscal Q4."

With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier  Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer.
After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights; Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials; and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter.
Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive products and technology assets.
Given unabated growth in data and the increasing role technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the marketplace. We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer-driven organization, and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution.
I am pleased to report that our integration activities associated with our acquisitions are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity focused on addressing the tremendous growth of data and the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet.
We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology road maps involving legacy WD, HGST and SanDisk products, and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the new fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership. We announced our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3. With an industry-leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability, pilot production of BiCS3 has commenced and we expect meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017. And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition.
We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile in addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and positive spirit of our employees and the favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers.
I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations."

I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device and client solution markets. We have been combining our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision.
Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling and aligning the various product road maps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed time line. We have identified key leaders for our various functions, and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees. Coupled with a series of restructuring actions we have taken over the last 2 years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in recent months with the closure of 2 facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore.
Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we have reduced our overall facilities footprint by almost 1/5 and our headcount by almost 1/4 over the last 2 fiscal years.
Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results. In HDDs, we achieved overall exabyte growth of 12% on a year-on-year basis primarily driven by shipments of our Capacity Enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth within our Capacity Enterprise product line was 47% on a year-on-year basis, faster than the market growth rate, thanks to the ongoing success of our helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10-terabyte product to high volume, our third-generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generational advantage and has already created significant marketplace momentum. At enterprise SSDs, we saw strength in sales in both enterprise and in cloud customers.
From a client device's perspective, we are benefiting from the growth -- growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HD unit shipments declined year-over-year.
In our other flash-related businesses, we saw a broad-based strength across several key markets, and our operational execution was strong across the board. Our industry-leading 50-nanometer technology remained the workhorse, and it accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 50-nanometer technology set another record, and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in the key markets we serve.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next-generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our 3-bit per cell or X3 architecture delivering the industry's smallest 256-gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost-reduction capabilities beyond our 50-nanometer node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3 instead of BiCS2, and this will allow us to rapidly convert to our next-generation 3D NAND technology in 2017. Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology to have a long tail as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets.
From a wafer fab standpoint, in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the planned mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies for the rest of the year, we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimate for a total industry bit supply growth as we had previously indicated. However, as we look to 2017, the planned rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enable the mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry.
Switching to the near term. We believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following: new product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business, along with the seasonality; additionally, SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs even as PC unit volumes shrink; we are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology; and we are experiencing stronger demand in non-SSD flash markets such as mobile and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business.
Offsetting these factors, we have seen share-driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. These include the low end of the 2.5-inch HDD market and the 8-terabyte capacity point in Capacity Enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas.
Our fiscal Q4 performance and forward guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account.
To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is in a -- very unique in our industry. The combination of WD, HGST and SanDisk has allowed us to methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business.
With that, I will turn the call over Olivier to review our Q4 financial results."

It is an exciting time for me to be leading the company in this new role, and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I've been with the company and in the industry for many years.
Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward. With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value-creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling, long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above-industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies.
Today, we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet, consistent with our value-creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of 3 primary end markets: one, data center devices and solutions; two, client devices; and three, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these 3 end markets.
Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value, including revenue and exabyte shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mix-up strategies for our NAND and HDD products, respectively. 
We have discontinued providing the following information in the quarterly fact sheet: revenue from top 10 customers, enterprise SSDs and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business. As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today.
In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary on key operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost-reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market, our value-creation drivers and historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for our transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year.
At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics, including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow, for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deep understanding and discussion of our business.
I would like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance costs over the term of the debt, and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million each quarter thereafter over the next 5 years. These debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make.
Second, through the purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cash related to these yen hedges.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90.

So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instruments. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gains. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would have had a benefit of $26 million, and in fiscal Q2, we would have had a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for the change in reporting due to purchase accounting. With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms."

It's our job from the management perspective to manage that volatility and to reduce its impact on our P&L, on our balance sheet and corresponding impact on shareholders. So a fluctuation in the yen, just like changes in other variables that we deal with, our job is to manage that. By the way, absent the impact -- I don't say absent, but even with the impact of purchase accounting, we're able to offset largely the impact in terms of the change in the value of the yen on our first quarter results, and I think it's important to emphasize that fact."

I have no -- nothing to report in terms of the status of that, other than we're currently in discussions with them. And then the additional point that I will make, which we talked about as part of the acquisition, is that when we did our forward modeling of the impact of that, we were, I will call it, relatively conservative in terms of our assumptions. And so we did not get overly aggressive as to what we thought. So we feel like we're sufficiently protected in terms of how that might turn out from a future financial modeling perspective."

One of the things that Mike said it, we have been very aggressive over a period of time of taking capacity out, both in the form of brick-and-mortar as well as in terms of headcount, to react to the decline that we've seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers. We've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our headcount over the course of the last 2 years. We also have -- we're -- we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to 1/3 and when you look at from 2 years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can. Obviously, our margins, in terms of what we reported on the hard drive side, shows that we've done a pretty good job of managing the cost side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. I have no doubt that we'll continue to do that going forward. In terms of the -- your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase is really a couple of different things. One, there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior -- for fiscal Q4."

With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier  Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer.
After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights; Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials; and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter.
Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79. Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive products and technology assets.
Given unabated growth in data and the increasing role technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the marketplace. We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer-driven organization, and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution.
I am pleased to report that our integration activities associated with our acquisitions are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity focused on addressing the tremendous growth of data and the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet.
We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology road maps involving legacy WD, HGST and SanDisk products, and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the new fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership. We announced our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3. With an industry-leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability, pilot production of BiCS3 has commenced and we expect meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017. And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition.
We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile in addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and positive spirit of our employees and the favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers.
I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations."

I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device and client solution markets. We have been combining our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision.
Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling and aligning the various product road maps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed time line. We have identified key leaders for our various functions, and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees. Coupled with a series of restructuring actions we have taken over the last 2 years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in recent months with the closure of 2 facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore.
Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we have reduced our overall facilities footprint by almost 1/5 and our headcount by almost 1/4 over the last 2 fiscal years.
Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results. In HDDs, we achieved overall exabyte growth of 12% on a year-on-year basis primarily driven by shipments of our Capacity Enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth within our Capacity Enterprise product line was 47% on a year-on-year basis, faster than the market growth rate, thanks to the ongoing success of our helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10-terabyte product to high volume, our third-generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generational advantage and has already created significant marketplace momentum. At enterprise SSDs, we saw strength in sales in both enterprise and in cloud customers.
From a client device's perspective, we are benefiting from the growth -- growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HD unit shipments declined year-over-year.
In our other flash-related businesses, we saw a broad-based strength across several key markets, and our operational execution was strong across the board. Our industry-leading 50-nanometer technology remained the workhorse, and it accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 50-nanometer technology set another record, and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in the key markets we serve.
Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next-generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our 3-bit per cell or X3 architecture delivering the industry's smallest 256-gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost-reduction capabilities beyond our 50-nanometer node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3 instead of BiCS2, and this will allow us to rapidly convert to our next-generation 3D NAND technology in 2017. Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology to have a long tail as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets.
From a wafer fab standpoint, in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the planned mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies for the rest of the year, we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimate for a total industry bit supply growth as we had previously indicated. However, as we look to 2017, the planned rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enable the mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry.
Switching to the near term. We believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following: new product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business, along with the seasonality; additionally, SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs even as PC unit volumes shrink; we are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology; and we are experiencing stronger demand in non-SSD flash markets such as mobile and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business.
Offsetting these factors, we have seen share-driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. These include the low end of the 2.5-inch HDD market and the 8-terabyte capacity point in Capacity Enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas.
Our fiscal Q4 performance and forward guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account.
To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is in a -- very unique in our industry. The combination of WD, HGST and SanDisk has allowed us to methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business.
With that, I will turn the call over Olivier to review our Q4 financial results."

It is an exciting time for me to be leading the company in this new role, and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I've been with the company and in the industry for many years.
Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward. With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value-creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling, long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above-industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies.
Today, we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet, consistent with our value-creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of 3 primary end markets: one, data center devices and solutions; two, client devices; and three, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these 3 end markets.
Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value, including revenue and exabyte shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mix-up strategies for our NAND and HDD products, respectively. 
We have discontinued providing the following information in the quarterly fact sheet: revenue from top 10 customers, enterprise SSDs and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business. As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today.
In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary on key operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost-reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market, our value-creation drivers and historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for our transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year.
At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics, including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow, for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deep understanding and discussion of our business.
I would like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance costs over the term of the debt, and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million each quarter thereafter over the next 5 years. These debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make.
Second, through the purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cash related to these yen hedges.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90.

So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instruments. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gains. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would have had a benefit of $26 million, and in fiscal Q2, we would have had a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for the change in reporting due to purchase accounting. With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms."

It's our job from the management perspective to manage that volatility and to reduce its impact on our P&L, on our balance sheet and corresponding impact on shareholders. So a fluctuation in the yen, just like changes in other variables that we deal with, our job is to manage that. By the way, absent the impact -- I don't say absent, but even with the impact of purchase accounting, we're able to offset largely the impact in terms of the change in the value of the yen on our first quarter results, and I think it's important to emphasize that fact."

So one of the things -- the first question has to do with HDD capacity, so just to comment on that. One of the things that Mike said it, we have been very aggressive over a period of time of taking capacity out, both in the form of brick-and-mortar as well as in terms of headcount, to react to the decline that we've seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers. We've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our headcount over the course of the last 2 years. We also have -- we're -- we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to 1/3 and when you look at from 2 years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can. Obviously, our margins, in terms of what we reported on the hard drive side, shows that we've done a pretty good job of managing the cost side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. I have no doubt that we'll continue to do that going forward. In terms of the -- your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase is really a couple of different things. One, there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior -- for fiscal Q4."

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter.
I am pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category.
We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud- and mobility-based applications as well as better-than-expected PC demand in our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter.
We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, and increasing level of customer intimacy, and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies. 
We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives.
The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections. The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors, and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook.
I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance while at the same time, successfully executing on 2 top priorities namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD and the transition to next-generation NAND technology. Integration of the 3 companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track.
I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned, and we will began a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017 as previously announced.
Mike Cordano will now report in our business highlights in the September quarter."

Industry [ph] supply-demand environment is -- in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity. As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses, and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technologies.
Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabyte shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our nearline capacity HDDs with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipped. I'm very pleased to report that our industry leading 10-terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering.
Just 2 weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013. This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher-density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate the future magnetic recording technologies.
In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for the new software-defined storage solution.
In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs as that  market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our ""3 bits per cell based"" embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to ""2 bits per cell based"" alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3-bits-per-cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors.
We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings.
Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remained solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1-terabit SD card.
From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers, and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64 layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15-nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements.
In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant, and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect the overall supply-demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained, resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant, and we are focused on offering our industry leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."
314057,403426664,1062251,"Western Digital Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of d",1380,"Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to 2 repricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team.
Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our data center revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs.
Clients devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC application as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handset. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better-than-anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvements resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower-margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter.
Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy targets.
Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semi-annual basis. We believe this semi-annual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first 6 months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level. Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million.
On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of EUR 885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the 2 repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt. Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $440 million in cash from operations with $210 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to the June quarter-end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt.
As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017 and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
Now I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP result. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis. The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million from $952 million to $863 million. Our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million, and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense.  While the September quarter is typically a high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamic and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix, reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key area. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized 1 quarter in arrear. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement, and we'll provide further updates as this situation changes.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the target set for the first 6 months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense in amortization of debt issuance cost from the debt repricing and pay down transactions. We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% of 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95, with an estimated share count 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis, including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60. 
At our Investor Day in December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities, and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.

But as you go into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, that effect will be eliminated as we reset the target and our forecast would include, have a normalized 100% target achievement there. So the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to really the end of fiscal '17, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation and then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first 6 months of the calendar year as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay because we're below that 100% target. And for the remainder of calendar year '16, you would be deducting that coverage. And then for the first half of calendar '17, you would not have that short-term bonus effect."

There are a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity. Because as you know, kind of several years we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products or various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we are able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again we are going to continue to rationalize those as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously, when you're talking about Capacity Enterprise products, which as Mike indicated, the demand for there has been -- and in that space been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the flatter count. And that has -- we have less flexibility both in terms of leadtime and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch closely and more aggressive with our customers, for one reason or another we were to see call it despite from demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So that's one thing that we're a bit cautious on right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we were at from utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front."

So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model, basically, where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics. So what I would expect is our inventory will likely trend up, and this is really a function of us building our strategic reserves as we restructure parts of our supply chain. And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business, the allocation will begin to soften and will begin to build more inventory. So that will trend upwards a little bit. But then you'll, I think, see payables to be extended from where they were in Q1. So I think overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters, primarily as a function of our restructurings and ongoing integration activities.

So the sort of efficiency gains, technologically although we expect some of the future, the largest magnitude of that of sort of that have run its course. The other one is operational efficiency and that underpins what Steve said, they are maturing as operational units, their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their feet, those processes are maturing. So really what we now see and the, what perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%. But as I've said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward."

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter.
I am pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category.
We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud- and mobility-based applications as well as better-than-expected PC demand in our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter.
We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, and increasing level of customer intimacy, and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies. 
We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives.
The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections. The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors, and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook.
I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance while at the same time, successfully executing on 2 top priorities namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD and the transition to next-generation NAND technology. Integration of the 3 companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track.
I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned, and we will began a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017 as previously announced.
Mike Cordano will now report in our business highlights in the September quarter."

Industry supply-demand environment is -- in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity. As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses, and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technologies.
Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabyte shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our nearline capacity HDDs with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipped. I'm very pleased to report that our industry leading 10-terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering.
Just 2 weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013. This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher-density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate the future magnetic recording technologies.
In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for the new software-defined storage solution.
In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs as that  market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our ""3 bits per cell based"" embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to ""2 bits per cell based"" alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3-bits-per-cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors.
We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings.
Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remained solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1-terabit SD card.
From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers, and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64-layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15-nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements.
In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant, and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect the overall supply-demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained, resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant, and we are focused on offering our industry leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter.

I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to 2 repricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team.
Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our data center revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs.
Client devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC application as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handset. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better-than-anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvements resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower-margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter.
Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy targets.
Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semi-annual basis. We believe this semi-annual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first 6 months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level. Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million.
On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of EUR 885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the 2 repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt. Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $440 million in cash from operations with $210 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to the June quarter-end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt.
As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017 and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
Now I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP result. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis. The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million from $952 million to $863 million. Our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million, and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense.  While the September quarter is typically a high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamic and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix, reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key area. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized 1 quarter in arrear. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement, and we'll provide further updates as this situation changes.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the targets set for the first 6 months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense in amortization of debt issuance cost from the debt repricing and pay-down transactions. We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% to 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 with an estimated share count, 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis, including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60.
At our Investor Day in December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?"

So what -- the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to, really, the end of fiscal '17, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation, and then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first 6 months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay, right, because we were below that 100% target.

So this is Steve. I'll take that. So I would say that --  I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because, as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products or various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we are going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously, when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand for there has been -- in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the flatter count. And that has -- we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if, for one reason or another, we were to see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So that's one thing that we're a bit cautious on right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front."

So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics. So what I would expect is inventory will likely trend up, and this is really a function of us building our strategic reserves as we restructure parts of our supply chain. And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business. The allocation will begin to soften and will begin to build more inventory. So that will trend upwards a little bit. But you'll then, I think, see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters primarily as a function of our restructurings and ongoing integration activities.

So what we do see is continued growth of capacity enterprise that we articulated, and that's going to be long into the future. Although flash, flash revenue and flash bps on a proportionate basis is growing faster. So from that standpoint, that's the trend we would point you to. And they have very different purposes in the hierarchy. So we continue to obviously work closely with those that are innovating around data center architectures, and we intend to sort of deploy our technology and our products in an optimal way to those trend."

So the sort of efficiency gains technologically, although we expect some in the future, the largest magnitude of that have sort of run its course. The other one is operational efficiency, and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units. Their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their feet, that -- those processes are maturing. So really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things, and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%, but as I've said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward."

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter.
I am pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category.
We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud- and mobility-based applications as well as better-than-expected PC demand and our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter.
We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, an increasing level of customer intimacy, and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies. 
We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives.
The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections. The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors, and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook.
I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance while at the same time, successfully executing on 2 top priorities namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD and the transition to next-generation NAND technology. Integration of the 3 companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track.
I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned, and we will began a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017 as previously announced.
Mike Cordano will now report on our business highlights in the September quarter."

The industry supply-demand environment is -- in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity. As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses, and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technologies.
Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabyte shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our nearline capacity HDDs, with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipped. I'm very pleased to report that our industry leading 10-terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering.
Just 2 weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform, with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013. This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher-density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate future magnetic recording technologies.
In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for their new software-defined storage solution.
In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs as that market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our ""3 bits per cell based"" embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to ""2 bits per cell based"" alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3-bits-per-cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors.
We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings.
Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remained solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1-terabit SD card.
From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers, and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64-layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15-nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements.
In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant, and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect the overall supply-demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained, resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant, and we are focused on offering our industry leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to 2 repricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team.
Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our data center revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs.
Client devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC applications as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handsets. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better-than-anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvements resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower-margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter.
Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy targets.
Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semi-annual basis. We believe this semi-annual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first 6 months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level. Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million.
On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of EUR 885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the 2 repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt. Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $440 million in cash from operations with $210 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to the June quarter-end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt.
As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017 and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
Now I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis. The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million, from $952 million to $863 million. Our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million, and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense.  While the September quarter is typically a high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamics and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix, reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key areas. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized 1 quarter in arrears. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement, and we'll provide further updates as this situation changes.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the targets set for the first 6 months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense and amortization of debt issuance cost from the debt repricing and pay-down transactions. We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% to 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 with an estimated share count, 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis, including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60.
At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital.

So what -- the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to, really, the end of fiscal '17, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation, and then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first 6 months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay, right, because we were below that 100% target. And for the remainder of the calendar year '16, you would be deducting that overage. And then for the first half of calendar '17, you would not have that short-term bonus effect."

So this is Steve. I'll take that. So I would say that --  I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because, as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products or various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we are going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously, when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand for there has been -- in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the flatter count. And that has -- we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if, for one reason or another, we were to see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So that's one thing that we're a bit cautious about right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front."

So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics.

And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business -- the allocation will begin to soften and we'll begin to build more inventory. So that will trend upwards a little bit. But you'll then, I think, see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters primarily as a function of our restructurings and ongoing integration activities.

The other one is operational efficiency, and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units. Their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their feet, that -- those processes are maturing. So really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things, and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter.
I am pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category.
We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud- and mobility-based applications as well as better-than-expected PC demand and our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter.
We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, an increasing level of customer intimacy, and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies. 
We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives.
The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections. The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors, and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook.
I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance while at the same time, successfully executing on 2 top priorities namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD and the transition to next-generation NAND technology. Integration of the 3 companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track.
I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned, and we will began a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017 as previously announced.
Mike Cordano will now report on our business highlights in the September quarter."

With a full qua",700,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our operational execution and the resulting business performance for the September quarter. The industry supply-demand environment is -- in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity. As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses, and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technologies.
Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabyte shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our nearline capacity HDDs, with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipped. I'm very pleased to report that our industry leading 10-terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering.
Just 2 weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform, with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013. This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher-density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate future magnetic recording technologies.
In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for their new software-defined storage solution.
In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs as that market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our ""3 bits per cell based"" embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to ""2 bits per cell based"" alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3-bits-per-cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors.
We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings.
Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remained solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1-terabit SD card.
From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers, and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64-layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15-nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements.
In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant, and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect the overall supply-demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained, resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant, and we are focused on offering our industry leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."
314057,403426664,1063355,"Western Digital Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of d",1379,"Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to 2 repricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team.
Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our data center revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw a continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs.
Client devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC applications as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handsets. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better-than-anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvements resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower-margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter.
Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy targets.
Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semi-annual basis. We believe this semi-annual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first 6 months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level. Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million.
On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of EUR 885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the 2 repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt. Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $440 million in cash from operations with $210 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion compared to the June quarter-end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt.
As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017 and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
Now I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis. The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million, from $952 million to $863 million. Our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million, and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information.
With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense.  While the September quarter is typically a high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamics and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix, reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key areas. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized 1 quarter in arrears. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement, and we'll provide further updates as this situation changes.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the targets set for the first 6 months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense and amortization of debt issuance cost from the debt repricing and pay-down transactions. We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% to 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 with an estimated share count, 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis, including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60.
At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital.

So what -- the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to, really, the end of fiscal '17, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation, and then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first 6 months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay, right, because we were below that 100% target. And for the remainder of the calendar year '16, you would be deducting that overage. And then for the first half of calendar '17, you would not have that short-term bonus effect."

So this is Steve. I'll take that. So I would say that --  I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because, as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products or various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we are going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously, when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand for there has been -- in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the flatter count. And that has -- we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if, for one reason or another, we were to see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So that's one thing that we're a bit cautious about right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front."

So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics.

And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business -- the allocation will begin to soften and we'll begin to build more inventory. So that will trend upwards a little bit. But you'll then, I think, see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters primarily as a function of our restructurings and ongoing integration activities. But one of the things we will be doing during Investor Day is providing more visibility into the dynamics of that as well as a way to think about our long-term financial model and the key metrics around cash flow generation."

So the sort of efficiency gains technologically, although we expect some in the future, the largest magnitude of that have sort of run its course. The other one is operational efficiency, and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units. Their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their feet, that -- those processes are maturing. So really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things, and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%, but as I've said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward."
