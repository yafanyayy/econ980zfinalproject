I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals.

I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our original guidance range. 
We continued our disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy, yielding free cash flow of over $325 million and a more than 3.5-point improvement in return on total capital relative to our 2013 baseline. 
We also distributed $365 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Given challenging economic conditions in many parts of the world and significant headwinds from currency translation, these results speak not only to the resilience of our businesses but to the creativity and commitment of our associates worldwide. And I'd really like to thank the team for delivering such a great year. 
What continues to guide our actions is the drive to achieve our long-term financial objectives, delight our customers and fully engage our talented workforce. I'm confident that the achievement of these goals will result in continued above-average returns for our shareholders. 
This past year represented an important milestone for us as the final year of measurement for the 4-year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. I'm very pleased to report that we substantially met or exceeded all of these targets. 
If you turn to Slide 6 of the supplemental materials we distributed today, you can see our final scorecard. On a compound annual basis, sales grew 4% organically and adjusted EPS grew 20%. We came in just slightly under our target for average annual free cash flow due to the one-time impact in 2014 of our decision to reduce the volatility of working capital at year-end. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. While net debt to adjusted EBITDA is still below our long-term target, we'll continue to exercise discipline in the execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
In May of 2014, we communicated a new set of targets extending our planning horizon to 2018 and raising the bar for both organic sales growth and operating margin. You can see the total company scorecard on Slide 7. And if you turn to Slide 8, the progress against the long-term targets for our 2 core segments. 
As the chart on the left shows, 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth for Pressure-sensitive Materials, above the high end of its long-term target. Performance was solid across all key product segments and regions with above-average growth in targeted higher value segments. 
While sales growth in emerging markets was slower than usual this year, in the fourth quarter, we gained momentum in Asia. We exceeded our long-term operating margin target by 70 basis points in 2015. The vast majority of PSM's margin expansion last year was driven by productivity and fixed cost leverage on the strong volume growth. So we do expect to sustain margin in this segment at 11% or possibly higher. 
In contrast to the strength in PSM, RBIS has had a slow start against this 5-year goal. Growth has been too volatile and we've been behind on the pace we set for margin expansion. We began executing a new strategy in 2015 to accelerate growth in the core business through a more competitive, faster and simpler business model. 
The team made good progress against its financial targets in the second half of the year, delivering both top line growth and margin improvement, with particular strength in Radio Frequency Identification products for RFID. We also saw improvement in the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments of our core business in the back half of the year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth in this business. RFID, of course, remains a key growth catalyst, with a 5-year compound annual growth target through 2018 of 15% to 20% plus. Sales of RFID products increased by more than 20% this year and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016. 
Likewise, external embellishments grew more than 25% last year. While this category still is a small share of the total business, about $50 million in sales, we expect continued rapid growth of this highly differentiated, high-value category through 2018. We also expect to gain share in the less differentiated segments through faster service and a more competitive product offering enabled by our business transformation. 
In short, I'm confident that our strategic shift will get us back on track to accelerate growth and achieve our operating margin target by 2018. 
We didn't include Vancive Medical Technologies on Slide 8 because of its size. But let me touch quickly on this business. Though small today, Vancive continues to offer potential for sales and profit growth. In 2016, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product line as well as in our new antimicrobial wound dressing while delivering continued margin expansion. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a fragmented market that offers above-average growth with attractive margins. 
Returning to the total company view. We remain highly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals, based on our ability to execute against a few key strategies. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. In particular, global share gain opportunities in Performance Tapes and Graphics and our leadership position in RFID will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company. 
Emerging markets, while slower in 2015, will continue to be an important part of our growth story over the long term. Productivity driven margin improvement has been a hallmark for the company for many years now and will continue to be a major strategic focus. We will drive capital efficiency while continuing to invest to support growth in the high-value segments of our core businesses. To this end, we anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016 compared to last year, partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also to support our strategy to accelerate growth in high-value segments. 
On the PSM side, we're investing in capacity to support growth in the Graphics business while optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We are adding coating capacity in Asia to support still solid growth in that region. And we're investing in Information Systems to drive supply chain productivity by upgrading systems in our North American Materials business. 
In RBIS, major investments include capacity additions to support rapid growth of RFID and heat transfer technology as well as projects to support a more cost-effective footprint. Finally, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Looking to 2016. Given the lack of forward visibility in our market, our guidance reflects a number of significant uncertainties, including: Emerging market growth; the net impact of deflation and pricing; a challenging environment for apparel retailers; and, of course, currency rates. 
Despite these challenges, we expect to deliver another year of solid progress against our long-term strategic and financial goals in 2016. Adjusting for a roughly $0.18 hit from currency translation, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance reflects a 15% growth rate with further expansion of our return on capital. Our solid free cash flow combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, will remain a disciplined investor. 
In short, we're committed to hitting our 2018 targets and I remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to meet our long-term goals for superior value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016.

I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016. 
In Q4, adjusted earnings per share declined 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting an extra week in the 2014 fiscal year as well as the effect of currency translation. EPS was above our expectations in October due to higher than expected sales and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate contributed $0.06 to the quarter and year. 
Organic sales growth, which adjusts for that extra week as well as currency translation and a small product line divestiture, was 7% overall. And was strong for both core businesses. The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 8% while the impact of the extra week represented an additional headwind of approximately 7.5%. Together, these factors had a roughly $0.20 negative impact to EPS compared to last year's fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 60 basis points to 8.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Restructuring savings net of transition expenses were $22 million in the quarter and $71 million for the year, in line with our expectation. 
Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and 33% for the full year, better than expected due to the resolution of foreign tax examinations during the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $329 million, representing 103% conversion of adjusted net income. 
Combined spending on capital projects and restructuring were roughly in line with our expectations for the year, albeit, with a different mix than originally planned. As Dean mentioned, we anticipate a significant increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects initiated in 2015. Importantly, we have not revised our outlook for cumulative investments in capital and restructuring through 2018. 
As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 3.9 million shares in 2015 at a cost of $232 million and paid $133 million in dividend. We ended the year with roughly 91.7 million shares outstanding, including dilution, representing a 700,000 share decline compared to the end of 2014. We did pick up the pace of share buyback in the fourth quarter, in part, to cover above average dilution resulting from the rapid rise in our stock price over the course of the year. We have sufficient debt capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. 
Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 7% on an organic basis, above expectations due to volume improvements in emerging markets, particularly in China. 
Sales in both Label and Packaging Materials and combined Graphics and Performance Tapes increased mid-single digits organically. 
On a regional basis, sales in North America increased at a low single-digit rate while Western Europe was up mid single-digits. As Dean mentioned, organic sales growth in emerging markets picked up in the fourth quarter. China was up mid-single digits, a meaningful improvement from the low single-digit pace we've seen in the country over the previous 5 quarters. 
We saw a surge in demand for e-commerce Labels as well as continued momentum in Specialty Products. Both India and the ASEAN region continued to be strong, posting double-digit organic growth rates for the quarter. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 11% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Given the headwind from the extra week last year, higher volume did not contribute materially to margin expansion, as it had done in the previous 3 quarters. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we experienced a modest benefit from deflation net of price. This benefit tends to net out over the long-term so it is reasonable to assume that we'll see some offset to these gains over a full business cycle. 
Switching over to RBIS. Sales increased by approximately 8% on an organic basis, with significant contributions from both RFID products and external embellishments. 
Consistent with recent quarters, sales growth among U.S.-based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts. Adjusting for the impact of RFID sales, we once again saw stronger growth in the Performance segment globally and the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments improved, a positive sign that they we're beginning to gain traction with our strategy change. 
Adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 8.4% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by 13% on an organic basis, due in part to difficult comparisons against the prior year related to a shift in orders from the third to the fourth quarter in 2014. As we've said before, given the application specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat volatile quarter-to-quarter. The business was profitable for the quarter in line with expectations. 
Turning now to our outlook for consolidated topline growth and earnings in 2016. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 13 of our supplemental presentation material. 
We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. Included in this estimate is in an assumed slowdown of the 2015 pace of growth for PSM due largely to the loss of a large customer program in the personal care sector at the Performance Tapes business. Changes to the customer's technology drove the decision to bring this program to a close. The program loss represents a roughly 1 point headwind to PSM's growth in 2016, largely impacting the second half of the year. 
Note that while the total Performance Tapes business will show a decline in sales on an organic basis for 2016, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the industrial side of the business, reflecting progress against our share gain strategy and its high-value segment. 
At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 3.5%, representing a pretax earnings headwind of approximately $25 million or roughly $0.18 per share. We estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute roughly $75 million in 2016, about 1/3 of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2015. Approximately 2/3 of the total savings relate to actions taken in RBIS to drive a more competitive business model. Combined with the other cost reductions and the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these actions will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margins at 10% to 11%. 
We continue to expect a tax rate in the low to mid 30% range. We estimate average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of roughly 90 million shares, reflecting our continued return of cash to shareholders. We anticipate significantly higher than usual adjustments to GAAP net income this year due to noncash charges associated with the lump sum settlement of certain pension obligations. This relates to an offer we made to former employees to receive their benefits immediately as either a lump sum payment or an annuity rather than waiting till they become retirement eligible. The purpose of this program is to reduce the financial volatility associated with our frozen defined benefit plan. You can pick up more details in today's press release. But the short story is that we reduced our pension liability by about $70 million with no increase in required cash contributions to the plan. 
We anticipate spending approximately $200 million of fixed capital and IT projects in 2016 and expect to incur about $25 million in cash restructuring charges, which together represent a $20 million increase over our level of spending last year. 
In light of the higher CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow conversion of roughly 100% of adjusted net income. We do, however, continue to expect cumulative free cash flow conversion over the coming years to exceed 100%. Importantly, while the continued currency headwind pull our 2016 EPS growth rate lower long-term target, our guidance for the year is consistent with the progress we believe is necessary to achieve our key long-term financial target. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of solid earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our 2 market leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth, which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline, enable us to extend margin and increase returns and achieve our 2018 targets.

I think last year, we experienced reasonably strong growth in Europe. Again, probably a little bit better than our expectations. But I can relate that back to reasonable amount of consumer spending there. The U.S. was not as strong as Europe. But stronger than we expected going into the year. So I would say those 2 economies are relatively stable. I don't think any big -- we're not expecting any big surprises in mature markets and feel good about the economies there and prospects. Latin America has been a challenge but also good for us, I would say because we're a stable player in the region. We've been able to protect our dollar-based profits in that region through a lot of price increases, given the challenges there. And then, Asia has been strong. India, ASEAN, very strong throughout the year and China was the one area where I think we were continuously disappointed in for the last, well, for the last 5 quarters. Our hypothesis is that inventories in that market were kind of full and we've had customers telling us anecdotally that they just didn't have the sales. We did see some shift in that trend. But we also are tapping into a pretty high growth area in China, something called a logistics label. It's a little more sophisticated than a barcode label. But fundamentally, it's growth driver is the rapid acceleration of online ordering and everything that's delivered to your home, just like we do here in the U.S. So in the long run, we're still bullish on China because that Materials business there is really linked to consumer spending and as that economy begins to shift to a more services-based and consumer spending model, that should bode well for us in the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if we see continued volatility in China. But I don't have any specific note on that."

This is -- for us, Pressure-sensitive Materials is a high-return business. It is at a multiple of our cost of capital and driving growth, topline growth is also an important goal for us. So I feel good about the position of the business. And again, it's -- right now, with oil prices low, and I know a lot of people are saying, ""Well, that should be really help you."" And we have -- to be honest, we haven't seen that much change in the commodities we buy over the last 90 to 120 days. As you know, a lot of things we buy are several steps down from crude oil. And then there's still some economies where we see inflation. So I think the team's done a good job. We're going to continue to pursue our strategy of driving productivity, driving topline growth and mix and we have the expectation to continue to drive for more improvement. Those targets that we have, that we had set for 2018 are not a cap. They're simply a long-term sort of guidance range. But we feel confident that we can operate at 11% or over."

One of the advantages that we have is being able to offer the retailer form factors that are very similar to what they use today and it makes the incremental cost of adopting RFID even lower than it was before. So I think the team has been very innovative and creative driving both lower cost for inlay production but also at the same time, giving the retailer almost a seamless and lower cost transition. So we're really kind of changing the game there. We have invested a little more in the front end. But that's actually been in a good place for quite while. And we have a really experienced team that understands -- I would say we don't have so much a turnkey approach.

I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our original guidance range. We continued our disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy, yielding free cash flow of over $325 million and a more than 3.5-point improvement in return on total capital relative to our 2013 baseline. 
We also distributed $365 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks in dividends. Given challenging economic conditions in many parts of the world and significant headwinds from currency translation, these results speak not only to the resilience of our businesses but to the creativity and commitment of our associates worldwide. And I'd really like to thank the team for delivering such a great year. 
What continues to guide our actions is the drive to achieve our long-term financial objectives, delight our customers and fully engage our talented workforce. I'm confident that the achievement of these goals will result in continued above-average returns for our shareholders.  This past year represented an important milestone for us as the final year of measurement for the 4-year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. I'm very pleased to report that we substantially met or exceeded all of these targets. 
If you turn to Slide 6 of the supplemental materials we distributed today, you can see our final scorecard. On a compound annual basis, sales grew 4% organically and adjusted EPS grew 20%. We came in just slightly under our target for average annual free cash flow due to the one-time impact in 2014 of our decision to reduce the volatility of working capital at year-end. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. While net debt to adjusted EBITDA is still below our long-term target, we'll continue to exercise discipline in the execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
In May of 2014, we communicated a new set of targets extending our planning horizon to 2018 and raising the bar for both organic sales growth and operating margin. You can see the total company scorecard on Slide 7. And if you turn to Slide 8, the progress against the long-term targets for our 2 core segments. 
As the chart on the left shows, 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth for Pressure-sensitive Materials, above the high end of its long-term target. Performance was solid across all key product segments and regions with above-average growth in targeted higher value segments. 
While sales growth in emerging markets was slower than usual this year, in the fourth quarter, we gained momentum in Asia. We exceeded our long-term operating margin target by 70 basis points in 2015. The vast majority of PSM's margin expansion last year was driven by productivity and fixed cost leverage on the strong volume growth. So we do expect to sustain margin in this segment at 11% or possibly higher. 
In contrast to the strength in PSM, RBIS has had a slow start against this 5-year goals. Growth has been too volatile and we've been behind on the pace we set for margin expansion. We began executing a new strategy in 2015 to accelerate growth in the core business through a more competitive, faster and simpler business model. 
The team made good progress against its financial targets in the second half of the year, delivering both top line growth and margin improvement, with particular strength in radio frequency identification products, or RFID. We also saw improvement in the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments of our core business in the back half of the year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth in this business. RFID, of course, remains a key growth catalyst, with a 5-year compound annual growth target through 2018 of 15% to 20% plus. Sales of our RFID products increased by more than 20% this year and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016. 
Likewise, external embellishments grew more than 25% last year. While this category still is a small share of the total business, about $50 million in sales, we expect continued rapid growth of this highly differentiated, high-value category through 2018. We also expect to gain share in the less differentiated segments through faster service and a more competitive product offering enabled by our business transformation. 
In short, I'm confident that our strategic shift will get us back on track to accelerate growth and achieve our operating margin target by 2018.  We didn't include Vancive Medical Technologies on Slide 8 because of its size, but let me touch quickly on this business. Though small today, Vancive continues to offer potential for sales and profit growth. In 2016, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product line as well as in our new antimicrobial wound dressing while delivering continued margin expansion. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a fragmented market that offers above-average growth with attractive margins. 
Returning to the total company view. We remain highly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals, based on our ability to execute against a few key strategies. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. In particular, global share gain opportunities in Performance Tapes and Graphics and our leadership position in RFID will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company. 
Emerging markets, while slower in 2015, will continue to be an important part of our growth story over the long term. Productivity driven margin improvement has been a hallmark for the company for many years now and will continue to be a major strategic focus. We will drive capital efficiency while continuing to invest to support growth in a high-value segments of our core businesses. To this end, we anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016 compared to last year, partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also to support our strategy to accelerate growth in high-value segments. 
On the PSM side, we're investing in capacity to support growth in the Graphics business while optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We're adding coating capacity in Asia to support still solid growth in that region. And we're investing in Information Systems to drive supply chain productivity by upgrading systems in our North American Materials business. 
In RBIS, major investments include capacity additions to support rapid growth of RFID and heat transfer technology as well as projects to support a more cost-effective footprint. Finally, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Looking to 2016, given the lack of forward visibility in our markets, our guidance reflects a number of significant uncertainties, including emerging market growth; the net impact of deflation and pricing; a challenging environment for apparel retailers; and, of course, currency rates. 
Despite these challenges, we expect to deliver another year of solid progress against our long-term strategic and financial goals in 2016. Adjusting for a roughly $0.18 hit from currency translation, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance reflects a 15% growth rate with further expansion of our return on capital. Our solid free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, we'll remain a disciplined investor. 
In short, we're committed to hitting our 2018 targets and I remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to meet our long-term goals for superior value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016. 
In Q4, adjusted earnings per share declined 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting an extra week in the 2014 fiscal year as well as the effect of currency translation. EPS was above our expectations in October due to higher than expected sales and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate contributed $0.06 to the quarter and year. 
Organic sales growth, which adjusts for about an extra week as well as currency translation and a small product line divestiture, was 7% overall and was strong for both core businesses. The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 8% while the impact of the extra week represented an additional headwind of approximately 7.5%. Together, these factors had a roughly $0.20 negative impact to EPS compared to last year's fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 60 basis points to 8.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Restructuring savings, net of transition expenses, were $22 million in the quarter and $71 million for the year, in line with our expectation. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and 33% for the full year, better than expected due to the resolution of foreign tax examinations during the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $329 million, representing 103% conversion of adjusted net income. Combined spending on capital projects and restructuring were roughly in line with our expectations for the year, albeit with the different mix than originally planned. As Dean mentioned, we anticipate a significant increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects initiated in 2015. Importantly, we have not revised our outlook for cumulative investments in capital and restructuring through 2018. 
As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 3.9 million shares in 2015 at a cost of $232 million and paid $133 million in dividend. We ended the year with roughly 91.7 million shares outstanding, including dilution, representing a 700,000 share decline compared to the end of 2014. We did pick up the pace of share buyback in the fourth quarter, in part, to cover above average dilution resulting from the rapid rise in our stock price over the course of the year. We have sufficient debt capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 7% on an organic basis, above expectations due to volume improvement in emerging markets, particularly in China.  Sales in both Label and Packaging Materials and combined Graphics and Performance Tapes increased mid-single digits organically. 
On a regional basis, sales in North America increased at a low single-digit rate while Western Europe was up mid single-digits. As Dean mentioned, organic sales growth in emerging markets picked up in the fourth quarter. China was up mid-single digits, a meaningful improvement from the low single-digit pace we've seen in the country over the previous 5 quarters. We saw a surge in demand for e-commerce Labels as well as continued momentum in Specialty Products. Both India and the ASEAN region continued to be strong, posting double-digit organic growth rates for the quarter. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 11% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Given the headwind from the extra week last year, higher volume did not contribute materially to margin expansion as it had done in the previous 3 quarters. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we experienced a modest benefit from deflation net of price. This benefit tends to net out over the long-term so it is reasonable to assume that we'll see some offset to these gains over a full business cycle. 
Switching over to RBIS. Sales increased by approximately 8% on an organic basis, with significant contributions from both RFID products and external embellishments. 
Consistent with recent quarters, sales growth among U.S.-based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts. Adjusting for the impact of RFID sales, we once again saw stronger growth in the Performance segment globally and the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments improved, a positive sign that we're beginning to gain traction with our strategy change. Adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 8.4% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by 13% on an organic basis, due in part to difficult comparisons against the prior year related to a shift in orders from the third to the fourth quarter in 2014. As we've said before, given the application specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat volatile quarter-to-quarter. The business was profitable for the quarter in line with expectations. 
Turning now to our outlook for consolidated top line growth and earnings in 2016. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 13 of our supplemental presentation material. 
We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. Included in this estimate is an assumed slowdown of the 2015 pace of growth for PSM due largely to the loss of a large customer program in the personal care sector at the Performance Tapes business. Changes to the customer's technology drove the decision to bring this program to a close. The program loss represents a roughly 1 point headwind to PSM's growth in 2016, largely impacting the second half of the year.  Note that while the total Performance Tapes business will show a decline in sales on an organic basis in 2016, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the industrial side of the business, reflecting progress against our share gain strategy in its high-value segment. 
At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 3.5%, representing a pretax earnings headwind of approximately $25 million or roughly $0.18 per share. We estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute roughly $75 million in 2016, about 1/3 of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2015. Approximately 2/3 of the total savings relate to actions taken in RBIS to drive a more competitive business model. Combined with the other cost reductions and the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these actions will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margins at 10% to 11%. 
We continue to expect a tax rate in the low to mid 30% range. We estimate average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of roughly 90 million shares, reflecting our continued return of cash to shareholders. We anticipate significantly higher than usual adjustments to GAAP net income this year due to noncash charges associated with the lump sum settlement of certain pension obligations. This relates to an offer we made to former employees to receive their benefits immediately as either a lump sum payment or an annuity rather than waiting till they become retirement eligible. The purpose of this program is to reduce the financial volatility associated with our frozen defined benefit plan. You can pick up more details in today's press release but the short story is that we reduced our pension liability by about $70 million with no increase in required cash contributions to the plan. 
We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on fixed capital and IT projects in 2016 and expect to incur about $25 million in cash restructuring charges, which together represent a $20 million increase over our level of spending last year. In light of the higher CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow conversion of roughly 100% of adjusted net income. We do, however, continue to expect cumulative free cash flow conversion over the coming years to exceed 100%. Importantly, while the continued currency headwind pull our 2016 EPS growth rate lower long-term target, our guidance for the year is consistent with the progress we believe is necessary to achieve our key long-term financial target. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of solid earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our 2 market leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth, which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline, enable us to extend margins and increase returns and achieve our 2018 targets.

I think last year, we experienced reasonably strong growth in Europe. Again, probably a little bit better than our expectations. But I can relate that back to reasonable amount of consumer spending there. The U.S. was not as strong as Europe. But stronger than we expected going into the year. So I would say those 2 economies are relatively stable. I don't think any big -- we're not expecting any big surprises in mature markets and feel good about the economies there and prospects. Latin America has been a challenge but also good for us. I would say, because we're a stable player in the region, we've been able to protect our dollar-based profits in that region through a lot of price increases, given the challenges there. And then, Asia has been strong. India, ASEAN, very strong throughout the year and China was the one area where I think we were continuously disappointed in for the last, well, for the last 5 quarters. Our hypothesis is that inventories in that market were kind of full and we tried customers telling us anecdotally that they just didn't have the sales. We did see some shift in that trend but we also are tapping into a pretty high growth area in China, something called a logistics label. It's a little more sophisticated than a barcode label. But fundamentally, it's growth driver is the rapid acceleration of online ordering and everything's delivered to your home, much as we do here in the U.S. So in the long run, we're still bullish on China because the Materials business there is really linked to consumer spending and as that economy begins to shift to a more services-based in consumer spending model, that should bode well for us in the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if we see continued volatility in China. But I don't have any specific note on that."

Other regions clearly, some regions we have some big deflation and it's a competitive work environment, we're working through that.

I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals.

I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our original guidance range. We continued our disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy, yielding free cash flow of over $325 million and a more than 3.5-point improvement in return on total capital relative to our 2013 baseline. 
We also distributed $365 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks in dividends. Given challenging economic conditions in many parts of the world and significant headwinds from currency translation, these results speak not only to the resilience of our businesses but to the creativity and commitment of our associates worldwide. And I'd really like to thank the team for delivering such a great year. 
What continues to guide our actions is the drive to achieve our long-term financial objectives, delight our customers and fully engage our talented workforce. I'm confident that the achievement of these goals will result in continued above-average returns for our shareholders.  This past year represented an important milestone for us as the final year of measurement for the 4-year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. I'm very pleased to report that we substantially met or exceeded all of these targets. 
If you turn to Slide 6 of the supplemental materials we distributed today, you can see our final scorecard. On a compound annual basis, sales grew 4% organically and adjusted EPS grew 20%. We came in just slightly under our target for average annual free cash flow due to the one-time impact in 2014 of our decision to reduce the volatility of working capital at year-end. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. While net debt to adjusted EBITDA is still below our long-term target, we'll continue to exercise discipline in the execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
In May of 2014, we communicated a new set of targets extending our planning horizon to 2018 and raising the bar for both organic sales growth and operating margin. You can see the total company scorecard on Slide 7. And if you turn to Slide 8, the progress against the long-term targets for our 2 core segments. 
As the chart on the left shows, 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth for Pressure-sensitive Materials, above the high end of its long-term target. Performance was solid across all key product segments and regions with above-average growth in targeted higher value segments. 
While sales growth in emerging markets was slower than usual this year, in the fourth quarter, we gained momentum in Asia. We exceeded our long-term operating margin target by 70 basis points in 2015. The vast majority of PSM's margin expansion last year was driven by productivity and fixed cost leverage on the strong volume growth. So we do expect to sustain margin in this segment at 11% or possibly higher. 
In contrast to the strength in PSM, RBIS has had a slow start against this 5-year goals. Growth has been too volatile and we've been behind on the pace we set for margin expansion. We began executing a new strategy in 2015 to accelerate growth in the core business through a more competitive, faster and simpler business model. 
The team made good progress against its financial targets in the second half of the year, delivering both top line growth and margin improvement, with particular strength in radio frequency identification products, or RFID. We also saw improvement in the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments of our core business in the back half of the year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth in this business. RFID, of course, remains a key growth catalyst, with a 5-year compound annual growth target through 2018 of 15% to 20% plus. Sales of our RFID products increased by more than 20% this year and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016. 
Likewise, external embellishments grew more than 25% last year. While this category still is a small share of the total business, about $50 million in sales, we expect continued rapid growth of this highly differentiated, high-value category through 2018. We also expect to gain share in the less differentiated segments through faster service and a more competitive product offering enabled by our business transformation. 
In short, I'm confident that our strategic shift will get us back on track to accelerate growth and achieve our operating margin target by 2018.  We didn't include Vancive Medical Technologies on Slide 8 because of its size, but let me touch quickly on this business. Though small today, Vancive continues to offer potential for sales and profit growth. In 2016, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product line as well as in our new antimicrobial wound dressing while delivering continued margin expansion. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a fragmented market that offers above-average growth with attractive margins. 
Returning to the total company view. We remain highly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals, based on our ability to execute against a few key strategies. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. In particular, global share gain opportunities in Performance Tapes and Graphics and our leadership position in RFID will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company. 
Emerging markets, while slower in 2015, will continue to be an important part of our growth story over the long term. Productivity driven margin improvement has been a hallmark for the company for many years now and will continue to be a major strategic focus. We will drive capital efficiency while continuing to invest to support growth in a high-value segments of our core businesses. To this end, we anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016 compared to last year, partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also to support our strategy to accelerate growth in high-value segments. 
On the PSM side, we're investing in capacity to support growth in the Graphics business while optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We're adding coating capacity in Asia to support still solid growth in that region. And we're investing in Information Systems to drive supply chain productivity by upgrading systems in our North American Materials business. 
In RBIS, major investments include capacity additions to support rapid growth of RFID and heat transfer technology as well as projects to support a more cost-effective footprint. Finally, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Looking to 2016, given the lack of forward visibility in our markets, our guidance reflects a number of significant uncertainties, including emerging market growth; the net impact of deflation and pricing; a challenging environment for apparel retailers; and, of course, currency rates. 
Despite these challenges, we expect to deliver another year of solid progress against our long-term strategic and financial goals in 2016. Adjusting for a roughly $0.18 hit from currency translation, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance reflects a 15% growth rate with further expansion of our return on capital. Our solid free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, we'll remain a disciplined investor. 
In short, we're committed to hitting our 2018 targets and I remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to meet our long-term goals for superior value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016. 
In Q4, adjusted earnings per share declined 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting an extra week in the 2014 fiscal year as well as the effect of currency translation. EPS was above our expectations in October due to higher than expected sales and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate contributed $0.06 to the quarter and year. 
Organic sales growth, which adjusts for about an extra week as well as currency translation and a small product line divestiture, was 7% overall and was strong for both core businesses. The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 8% while the impact of the extra week represented an additional headwind of approximately 7.5%. Together, these factors had a roughly $0.20 negative impact to EPS compared to last year's fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 60 basis points to 8.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Restructuring savings, net of transition expenses, were $22 million in the quarter and $71 million for the year, in line with our expectation. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and 33% for the full year, better than expected due to the resolution of foreign tax examinations during the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $329 million, representing 103% conversion of adjusted net income. Combined spending on capital projects and restructuring were roughly in line with our expectations for the year, albeit with the different mix than originally planned. As Dean mentioned, we anticipate a significant increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects initiated in 2015. Importantly, we have not revised our outlook for cumulative investments in capital and restructuring through 2018. 
As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 3.9 million shares in 2015 at a cost of $232 million and paid $133 million in dividend. We ended the year with roughly 91.7 million shares outstanding, including dilution, representing a 700,000 share decline compared to the end of 2014. We did pick up the pace of share buyback in the fourth quarter, in part, to cover above average dilution resulting from the rapid rise in our stock price over the course of the year. We have sufficient debt capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 7% on an organic basis, above expectations due to volume improvement in emerging markets, particularly in China.  Sales in both Label and Packaging Materials and combined Graphics and Performance Tapes increased mid-single digits organically. 
On a regional basis, sales in North America increased at a low single-digit rate while Western Europe was up mid single-digits. As Dean mentioned, organic sales growth in emerging markets picked up in the fourth quarter. China was up mid-single digits, a meaningful improvement from the low single-digit pace we've seen in the country over the previous 5 quarters. We saw a surge in demand for e-commerce Labels as well as continued momentum in Specialty Products. Both India and the ASEAN region continued to be strong, posting double-digit organic growth rates for the quarter. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 11% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Given the headwind from the extra week last year, higher volume did not contribute materially to margin expansion as it had done in the previous 3 quarters. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we experienced a modest benefit from deflation net of price. This benefit tends to net out over the long-term so it is reasonable to assume that we'll see some offset to these gains over a full business cycle. 
Switching over to RBIS. Sales increased by approximately 8% on an organic basis, with significant contributions from both RFID products and external embellishments. 
Consistent with recent quarters, sales growth among U.S.-based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts. Adjusting for the impact of RFID sales, we once again saw stronger growth in the Performance segment globally and the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments improved, a positive sign that we're beginning to gain traction with our strategy change. Adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 8.4% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by 13% on an organic basis, due in part to difficult comparisons against the prior year related to a shift in orders from the third to the fourth quarter in 2014. As we've said before, given the application specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat volatile quarter-to-quarter. The business was profitable for the quarter in line with expectations. 
Turning now to our outlook for consolidated top line growth and earnings in 2016. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 13 of our supplemental presentation material. 
We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. Included in this estimate is an assumed slowdown of the 2015 pace of growth for PSM due largely to the loss of a large customer program in the personal care sector at the Performance Tapes business. Changes to the customer's technology drove the decision to bring this program to a close. The program loss represents a roughly 1 point headwind to PSM's growth in 2016, largely impacting the second half of the year.  Note that while the total Performance Tapes business will show a decline in sales on an organic basis in 2016, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the industrial side of the business, reflecting progress against our share gain strategy in its high-value segment. 
At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 3.5%, representing a pretax earnings headwind of approximately $25 million or roughly $0.18 per share. We estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute roughly $75 million in 2016, about 1/3 of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2015. Approximately 2/3 of the total savings relate to actions taken in RBIS to drive a more competitive business model. Combined with the other cost reductions and the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these actions will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margins at 10% to 11%. 
We continue to expect a tax rate in the low to mid 30% range. We estimate average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of roughly 90 million shares, reflecting our continued return of cash to shareholders. We anticipate significantly higher than usual adjustments to GAAP net income this year due to noncash charges associated with the lump sum settlement of certain pension obligations. This relates to an offer we made to former employees to receive their benefits immediately as either a lump sum payment or an annuity rather than waiting till they become retirement eligible. The purpose of this program is to reduce the financial volatility associated with our frozen defined benefit plan. You can pick up more details in today's press release but the short story is that we reduced our pension liability by about $70 million with no increase in required cash contributions to the plan. 
We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on fixed capital and IT projects in 2016 and expect to incur about $25 million in cash restructuring charges, which together represent a $20 million increase over our level of spending last year. In light of the higher CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow conversion of roughly 100% of adjusted net income. We do, however, continue to expect cumulative free cash flow conversion over the coming years to exceed 100%. Importantly, while the continued currency headwind pull our 2016 EPS growth rate lower long-term target, our guidance for the year is consistent with the progress we believe is necessary to achieve our key long-term financial target. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of solid earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our 2 market leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth, which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline, enable us to extend margins and increase returns and achieve our 2018 targets.

I think last year, we experienced reasonably strong growth in Europe. Again, probably a little bit better than our expectations. But I can relate that back to reasonable amount of consumer spending there. The U.S. was not as strong as Europe. But stronger than we expected going into the year. So I would say those 2 economies are relatively stable. I don't think any big -- we're not expecting any big surprises in mature markets and feel good about the economies there and prospects. Latin America has been a challenge but also good for us. I would say, because we're a stable player in the region, we've been able to protect our dollar-based profits in that region through a lot of price increases, given the challenges there. And then, Asia has been strong. India, ASEAN, very strong throughout the year and China was the one area where I think we were continuously disappointed in for the last, well, for the last 5 quarters. Our hypothesis is that inventories in that market were kind of full and we tried customers telling us anecdotally that they just didn't have the sales. We did see some shift in that trend but we also are tapping into a pretty high growth area in China, something called a logistics label. It's a little more sophisticated than a barcode label. But fundamentally, it's growth driver is the rapid acceleration of online ordering and everything's delivered to your home, much as we do here in the U.S. So in the long run, we're still bullish on China because the Materials business there is really linked to consumer spending and as that economy begins to shift to a more services-based in consumer spending model, that should bode well for us in the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if we see continued volatility in China. But I don't have any specific note on that."

Other regions clearly, some regions we have some big deflation and it's a competitive work environment, we're working through that.

I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our original guidance range. We continued our disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy, yielding free cash flow of over $325 million and a more than 3.5-point improvement in return on total capital relative to our 2013 baseline. 
We also distributed $365 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks ad dividends. Given challenging economic conditions in many parts of the world and significant headwinds from currency translation, these results speak not only to the resilience of our businesses but to the creativity and commitment of our associates worldwide. And I'd really like to thank the team for delivering such a great year. 
What continues to guide our actions is the drive to achieve our long-term financial objectives, delight our customers and fully engage our talented workforce. I'm confident that the achievement of these goals will result in continued above-average returns for our shareholders.  This past year represented an important milestone for us as the final year of measurement for the 4-year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. I'm very pleased to report that we substantially met or exceeded all of these targets. 
If you turn to Slide 6 of the supplemental materials we distributed today, you can see our final scorecard. On a compound annual basis, sales grew 4% organically and adjusted EPS grew 20%. We came in just slightly under our target for average annual free cash flow due to the one-time impact in 2014 of our decision to reduce the volatility of working capital at year-end. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. While net debt to adjusted EBITDA is still below our long-term target, we'll continue to exercise discipline in the execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
In May of 2014, we communicated a new set of targets extending our planning horizon to 2018 and raising the bar for both organic sales growth and operating margin. You can see the total company scorecard on Slide 7. And if you turn to Slide 8, the progress against the long-term targets for our 2 core segments. As the chart on the left shows, 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth for Pressure-sensitive Materials, above the high end of its long-term target. Performance was solid across all key product segments and regions with above-average growth in targeted higher value segments. 
While sales growth in emerging markets was slower than usual this year, in the fourth quarter, we gained momentum in Asia. We exceeded our long-term operating margin target by 70 basis points in 2015. The vast majority of PSM's margin expansion last year was driven by productivity and fixed cost leverage on the strong volume growth. So we do expect to sustain margin in this segment at 11% or possibly higher. 
In contrast to the strength in PSM, RBIS has had a slow start against this 5-year goals. Growth has been too volatile and we've been behind on the pace we set for margin expansion. We began executing a new strategy in 2015 to accelerate growth in the core business through a more competitive, faster and simpler business model. 
The team made good progress against its financial targets in the second half of the year, delivering both top line growth and margin improvement, with particular strength in radio frequency identification products, or RFID. We also saw improvement in the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments of our core business in the back half of the year. We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth in this business. RFID, of course, remains a key growth catalyst, with a 5-year compound annual growth target through 2018 of 15% to 20% plus. Sales of our RFID products increased by more than 20% this year and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016. 
Likewise, external embellishments grew more than 25% last year. While this category still is a small share of the total business, about $50 million in sales, we expect continued rapid growth of this highly differentiated, high-value category through 2018. We also expect to gain share in the less differentiated segments through faster service and a more competitive product offering enabled by our business transformation. 
In short, I'm confident that our strategic shift will get us back on track to accelerate growth and achieve our operating margin target by 2018.  We didn't include Vancive Medical Technologies on Slide 8 because of its size, but let me touch quickly on this business. Though small today, Vancive continues to offer potential for sales and profit growth. In 2016, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product line as well as in our new antimicrobial wound dressing while delivering continued margin expansion. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a fragmented market that offers above-average growth with attractive margins. 
Returning to the total company view. We remain highly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals, based on our ability to execute against a few key strategies. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. In particular, global share gain opportunities in Performance Tapes and Graphics and our leadership position in RFID will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company. 
Emerging markets, while slower in 2015, will continue to be an important part of our growth story over the long term. Productivity driven margin improvement has been a hallmark for the company for many years now and will continue to be a major strategic focus. We will drive capital efficiency while continuing to invest to support growth in the high-value segments of our core businesses. To this end, we anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016 compared to last year, partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also to support our strategy to accelerate growth in high-value segments. 
On the PSM side, we're investing in capacity to support growth in the Graphics business while optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We're adding coating capacity in Asia to support still solid growth in that region. And we're investing in Information Systems to drive supply chain productivity by upgrading systems in our North American Materials business.  In RBIS, major investments include capacity additions to support rapid growth of RFID and heat transfer technology as well as projects to support a more cost-effective footprint. Finally, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Looking to 2016, given the lack of forward visibility in our markets, our guidance reflects a number of significant uncertainties, including emerging market growth; the net impact of deflation and pricing; a challenging environment for apparel retailers; and, of course, currency rates.  Despite these challenges, we expect to deliver another year of solid progress against our long-term strategic and financial goals in 2016. Adjusting for a roughly $0.18 hit from currency translation, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance reflects a 15% growth rate with further expansion of our return on capital. Our solid free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, we'll remain a disciplined investor.  In short, we're committed to hitting our 2018 targets and I remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to meet our long-term goals for superior value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016. 
In Q4, adjusted earnings per share declined 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting an extra week in the 2014 fiscal year as well as the effect of currency translation. EPS was above our expectations in October due to higher than expected sales and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate contributed $0.06 to the quarter and year.  Organic sales growth, which adjusts for about an extra week as well as currency translation and a small product line divestiture, was 7% overall and was strong for both core businesses. The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 8% while the impact of the extra week represented an additional headwind of approximately 7.5%. Together, these factors had a roughly $0.20 negative impact to EPS compared to last year's fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 60 basis points to 8.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Restructuring savings, net of transition expenses, were $22 million in the quarter and $71 million for the year, in line with our expectations. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and 33% for the full year, better than expected due to the resolution of foreign tax examinations during the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $329 million, representing 103% conversion of adjusted net income. Combined spending on capital projects and restructuring were roughly in line with our expectations for the year, albeit with the different mix than originally planned. As Dean mentioned, we anticipate a significant increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects initiated in 2015. Importantly, we have not revised our outlook for cumulative investments in capital and restructuring through 2018. 
As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 3.9 million shares in 2015 at a cost of $232 million and paid $133 million in dividend. We ended the year with roughly 91.7 million shares outstanding, including dilution, representing a 700,000 share decline compared to the end of 2014. We did pick up the pace of share buyback in the fourth quarter, in part, to cover above average dilution resulting from the rapid rise in our stock price over the course of the year. We have sufficient debt capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 7% on an organic basis, above expectations due to volume improvement in emerging markets, particularly in China.  Sales in both Label and Packaging Materials and combined Graphics and Performance Tapes increased mid-single digits organically. 
On a regional basis, sales in North America increased at a low single-digit rate while Western Europe was up mid-single-digits. As Dean mentioned, organic sales growth in emerging markets picked up in the fourth quarter. China was up mid-single digits, a meaningful improvement from the low single-digit pace we've seen in the country over the previous 5 quarters. We saw a surge in demand for e-commerce Labels as well as continued momentum in Specialty Products. Both India and the ASEAN region continued to be strong, posting double-digit organic growth rates for the quarter. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 11% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Given the headwind from the extra week last year, higher volume did not contribute materially to margin expansion as it had done in the previous 3 quarters. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we experienced a modest benefit from deflation net of price. This benefit tends to net out over the long-term so it is reasonable to assume that we'll see some offset to these gains over a full business cycle. 
Switching over to RBIS. Sales increased by approximately 8% on an organic basis, with significant contributions from both RFID products and external embellishments. Consistent with recent quarters, sales growth among U.S.-based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts. Adjusting for the impact of RFID sales, we once again saw strong growth in the Performance segment globally and the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments improved, a positive sign that we're beginning to gain traction with our strategy change. Adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 8.4% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by 13% on an organic basis, due in part to difficult comparisons against the prior year related to a shift in orders from the third to the fourth quarter in 2014. As we've said before, given the application specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat volatile quarter-to-quarter. The business was profitable for the quarter in line with expectations. 
Turning now to our outlook for consolidated top line growth and earnings in 2016. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 13 of our supplemental presentation material.  We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. Included in this estimate is an assumed slowdown of the 2015 pace of growth for PSM due largely to the loss of a large customer program in the personal care sector at the Performance Tapes business. Changes to the customer's technology drove the decision to bring this program to a close. The program loss represents a roughly 1 point headwind to PSM's growth in 2016, largely impacting the second half of the year.  Note that while the total Performance Tapes business will show a decline in sales on an organic basis in 2016, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the industrial side of the business, reflecting progress against our share gain strategy in its high-value segment. 
At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 3.5%, representing a pretax earnings headwind of approximately $25 million or roughly $0.18 per share. We estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute roughly $75 million in 2016, about 1/3 of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2015. Approximately 2/3 of the total savings relate to actions taken in RBIS to drive a more competitive business model. Combined with the other cost reductions and the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these actions will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margins at 10% to 11%. 
We continue to expect a tax rate in the low to mid 30% range. We estimate average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of roughly 90 million shares, reflecting our continued return of cash to shareholders. We anticipate significantly higher than usual adjustments to GAAP net income this year due to noncash charges associated with the lump sum settlement of certain pension obligations. This relates to an offer we made to former employees to receive their benefits immediately as either a lump sum payment or an annuity rather than waiting till they become retirement eligible. The purpose of this program is to reduce the financial volatility associated with our frozen defined benefit plan. You can pick up more details in today's press release but the short story is that we reduced our pension liability by about $70 million with no increase in required cash contributions to the plan. 
We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on fixed capital and IT projects in 2016 and expect to incur about $25 million in cash restructuring charges, which together represent a $20 million increase over our level of spending last year. In light of the higher CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow conversion of roughly 100% of adjusted net income. We do, however, continue to expect cumulative free cash flow conversion over the coming years to exceed 100%. Importantly, while the continued currency headwind pull our 2016 EPS growth rate lower long-term target, our guidance for the year is consistent with the progress we believe is necessary to achieve our key long-term financial target. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of solid earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our 2 market leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth, which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline, enable us to extend margins and increase returns and achieve our 2018 targets.

I think last year, we experienced reasonably strong growth in Europe. Again, probably a little bit better than our expectations. But I can relate that back to reasonable amount of consumer spending there. The U.S. was not as strong as Europe. But stronger than we expected going into the year. So I would say those 2 economies are relatively stable. I don't think any big -- we're not expecting any big surprises in mature markets and feel good about the economies there and prospects. Latin America has been a challenge but also good for us. I would say, because we're a stable player in the region, we've been able to protect our dollar-based profits in that region through a lot of price increases, given the challenges there. And then, Asia has been strong. India, ASEAN, very strong throughout the year and China was the one area where I think we were continuously disappointed in for the last, well, for the last 5 quarters. Our hypothesis is that inventories in that market were kind of full and we tried customers telling us anecdotally that they just didn't have the sales. We did see some shift in that trend but we also are tapping into a pretty high growth area in China, something called a logistics label. It's a little more sophisticated than a barcode label. But fundamentally, it's growth driver is the rapid acceleration of online ordering and everything's delivered to your home, much as we do here in the U.S. So in the long run, we're still bullish on China because the Materials business there is really linked to consumer spending and as that economy begins to shift to a more services-based in consumer spending model, that should bode well for us in the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if we see continued volatility in China. But I don't have any specific note on that."

So I feel good about the position of the business. And again, it's -- right now, with oil prices low I know a lot of people are saying, ""Well, that should really help you."" And we have -- to be honest, we haven't seen that much change in the commodities we buy over the last 90 to 120 days. As you know, a lot of things we buy are several steps down from crude oil. And then there's still some economies where we're seeing inflation. So I think the team's done a good job. We're going to continue to pursue our strategy of driving productivity, driving top line growth and mix and we have the expectation to continue to drive for more improvement. Those targets that we have, that we had set for 2018 are not a cap. They're simply a long-term sort of guidance range. But we feel confident today that we can operate at 11% or over."

One of the advantages that we have is being able to offer the retailer form factors that are very similar to what they use today and it makes the incremental cost of adopting RFID even lower than it was before. So I think the team has been very innovative and creative driving both lower costs for inlay production but also at the same time, giving the retailer almost a seamless and lower cost transition. So we're really kind of changing the game there. We have invested a little more in the front end but that's actually been in place for quite a while. And we have a really experienced team that understands -- I would say we don't have so much a turnkey approach.

I'm very pleased to report another year of excellent progress toward our long-term goals. We delivered strong organic sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our original guidance range. We continued our disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy, yielding free cash flow of over $325 million and a more than 3.5-point improvement in return on total capital relative to our 2013 baseline. 
We also distributed $365 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Given challenging economic conditions in many parts of the world and significant headwinds from currency translation, these results speak not only to the resilience of our businesses but to the creativity and commitment of our associates worldwide. And I'd really like to thank the team for delivering such a great year. 
What continues to guide our actions is the drive to achieve our long-term financial objectives, delight our customers and fully engage our talented workforce. I'm confident that the achievement of these goals will result in continued above-average returns for our shareholders.  This past year represented an important milestone for us as the final year of measurement for the 4-year financial targets we first communicated in 2012. I'm very pleased to report that we substantially met or exceeded all of these targets. 
If you turn to Slide 6 of the supplemental materials we distributed today, you can see our final scorecard. On a compound annual basis, sales grew 4% organically and adjusted EPS grew 20%. We came in just slightly under our target for average annual free cash flow due to the one-time impact in 2014 of our decision to reduce the volatility of working capital at year-end. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. While net debt to adjusted EBITDA is still below our long-term target, we'll continue to exercise discipline in the execution of our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
In May of 2014, we communicated a new set of targets extending our planning horizon to 2018 and raising the bar for both organic sales growth and operating margin. You can see the total company scorecard on Slide 7. And if you turn to Slide 8, the progress against the long-term targets for our 2 core segments. As the chart on the left shows, 2015 marked the fourth consecutive year of strong organic growth for Pressure-sensitive Materials, above the high end of its long-term target. Performance was solid across all key product segments and regions with above-average growth in targeted higher value segments. 
While sales growth in emerging markets was slower than usual this year, in the fourth quarter, we gained momentum in Asia. We exceeded our long-term operating margin target by 70 basis points in 2015. The vast majority of PSM's margin expansion last year was driven by productivity and fixed cost leverage on the strong volume growth. So we do expect to sustain margin in this segment at 11% or possibly higher. 
In contrast to the strength in PSM, RBIS has had a slow start against this 5-year goals. Growth has been too volatile and we've been behind on the pace we set for margin expansion. We began executing a new strategy in 2015 to accelerate growth in the core business through a more competitive, faster and simpler business model. 
The team made good progress against its financial targets in the second half of the year, delivering both top line growth and margin improvement, with particular strength in radio frequency identification products, or RFID. We also saw improvement in the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments of our core business in the back half of the year. We continue to see significant opportunities for top line growth in this business. RFID, of course, remains a key growth catalyst, with a 5-year compound annual growth target through 2018 of 15% to 20% plus. Sales of our RFID products increased by more than 20% this year and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016. 
Likewise, external embellishments grew more than 25% last year. While this category still is a small share of the total business, about $50 million in sales, we expect continued rapid growth of this highly differentiated, high-value category through 2018. We also expect to gain share in the less differentiated segments through faster service and a more competitive product offering enabled by our business transformation. 
In short, I'm confident that our strategic shift will get us back on track to accelerate growth and achieve our operating margin target by 2018.  We didn't include Vancive Medical Technologies on Slide 8 because of its size, but let me touch quickly on this business. Though small today, Vancive continues to offer potential for sales and profit growth. In 2016, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product line as well as in our new antimicrobial wound dressing while delivering continued margin expansion. Vancive continues to represent one of several very promising opportunities for us to gain share in a fragmented market that offers above-average growth with attractive margins. 
Returning to the total company view. We remain highly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals, based on our ability to execute against a few key strategies. We will grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service. In particular, global share gain opportunities in Performance Tapes and Graphics and our leadership position in RFID will continue to be key catalysts of long-term growth for the company. 
Emerging markets, while slower in 2015, will continue to be an important part of our growth story over the long term. Productivity driven margin improvement has been a hallmark for the company for many years now and will continue to be a major strategic focus. We will drive capital efficiency while continuing to invest to support growth in the high-value segments of our core businesses. To this end, we anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016 compared to last year, partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also to support our strategy to accelerate growth in high-value segments. 
On the PSM side, we're investing in capacity to support growth in the Graphics business while optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We're adding coating capacity in Asia to support still solid growth in that region. And we're investing in Information Systems to drive supply chain productivity by upgrading systems in our North American Materials business.  In RBIS, major investments include capacity additions to support rapid growth of RFID and heat transfer technology as well as projects to support a more cost-effective footprint. Finally, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Looking to 2016, given the lack of forward visibility in our markets, our guidance reflects a number of significant uncertainties, including emerging market growth; the net impact of deflation and pricing; a challenging environment for apparel retailers; and, of course, currency rates.  Despite these challenges, we expect to deliver another year of solid progress against our long-term strategic and financial goals in 2016. Adjusting for a roughly $0.18 hit from currency translation, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance reflects a 15% growth rate with further expansion of our return on capital. Our solid free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow the dividend, repurchase shares and pursue value enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. From a balance sheet perspective, while below our targeted leverage range today, we'll remain a disciplined investor.  In short, we're committed to hitting our 2018 targets and I remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to meet our long-term goals for superior value creation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and then I'll walk you through our outlook for 2016. 
In Q4, adjusted earnings per share declined 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting an extra week in the 2014 fiscal year as well as the effect of currency translation. EPS was above our expectations in October due to higher than expected sales and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate contributed $0.06 to the quarter and year.  Organic sales growth, which adjusts for about an extra week as well as currency translation and a small product line divestiture, was 7% overall and was strong for both core businesses. The impact of currency translation and the extra week were significant. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 8% while the impact of the extra week represented an additional headwind of approximately 7.5%. Together, these factors had a roughly $0.20 negative impact to EPS compared to last year's fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 60 basis points to 8.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Restructuring savings, net of transition expenses, were $22 million in the quarter and $71 million for the year, in line with our expectations. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and 33% for the full year, better than expected due to the resolution of foreign tax examinations during the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was $329 million, representing 103% conversion of adjusted net income. Combined spending on capital projects and restructuring were roughly in line with our expectations for the year, albeit with the different mix than originally planned. As Dean mentioned, we anticipate a significant increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects initiated in 2015. Importantly, we have not revised our outlook for cumulative investments in capital and restructuring through 2018. 
As Dean indicated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 3.9 million shares in 2015 at a cost of $232 million and paid $133 million in dividend. We ended the year with roughly 91.7 million shares outstanding, including dilution, representing a 700,000 share decline compared to the end of 2014. We did pick up the pace of share buyback in the fourth quarter, in part, to cover above average dilution resulting from the rapid rise in our stock price over the course of the year. We have sufficient debt capacity to continue our share buyback program in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales in the fourth quarter were up approximately 7% on an organic basis, above expectations due to volume improvement in emerging markets, particularly in China.  Sales in both Label and Packaging Materials and combined Graphics and Performance Tapes increased mid-single digits organically. 
On a regional basis, sales in North America increased at a low single-digit rate while Western Europe was up mid-single-digits. As Dean mentioned, organic sales growth in emerging markets picked up in the fourth quarter. China was up mid-single digits, a meaningful improvement from the low single-digit pace we've seen in the country over the previous 5 quarters. We saw a surge in demand for e-commerce Labels as well as continued momentum in Specialty Products. Both India and the ASEAN region continued to be strong, posting double-digit organic growth rates for the quarter. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 11% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. Given the headwind from the extra week last year, higher volume did not contribute materially to margin expansion as it had done in the previous 3 quarters. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we experienced a modest benefit from deflation net of price. This benefit tends to net out over the long-term so it is reasonable to assume that we'll see some offset to these gains over a full business cycle. 
Switching over to RBIS. Sales increased by approximately 8% on an organic basis, with significant contributions from both RFID products and external embellishments. Consistent with recent quarters, sales growth among U.S.-based retailers and brand owners outpaced their European counterparts. Adjusting for the impact of RFID sales, we once again saw strong growth in the Performance segment globally and the underlying trend for the less differentiated segments improved, a positive sign that we're beginning to gain traction with our strategy change. Adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 8.4% as the impact of productivity initiatives more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by 13% on an organic basis, due in part to difficult comparisons against the prior year related to a shift in orders from the third to the fourth quarter in 2014. As we've said before, given the application specific nature of orders in this business, we do expect sales growth to be somewhat volatile quarter-to-quarter. The business was profitable for the quarter in line with expectations. 
Turning now to our outlook for consolidated top line growth and earnings in 2016. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. We have outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 13 of our supplemental presentation material.  We estimate between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. Included in this estimate is an assumed slowdown of the 2015 pace of growth for PSM due largely to the loss of a large customer program in the personal care sector at the Performance Tapes business. Changes to the customer's technology drove the decision to bring this program to a close. The program loss represents a roughly 1 point headwind to PSM's growth in 2016, largely impacting the second half of the year.  Note that while the total Performance Tapes business will show a decline in sales on an organic basis in 2016, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the industrial side of the business, reflecting progress against our share gain strategy in its high-value segment. 
At recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 3.5%, representing a pretax earnings headwind of approximately $25 million or roughly $0.18 per share. We estimate the incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute roughly $75 million in 2016, about 1/3 of which represents the carryover benefit from actions taken in 2015. Approximately 2/3 of the total savings relate to actions taken in RBIS to drive a more competitive business model. Combined with the other cost reductions and the anticipated benefit of volume growth, we expect these actions will more than offset pricing adjustments and inflationary pressures in the business, getting us back on the trajectory needed to meet our 2018 adjusted operating margins at 10% to 11%. 
We continue to expect a tax rate in the low to mid 30% range. We estimate average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of roughly 90 million shares, reflecting our continued return of cash to shareholders. We anticipate significantly higher than usual adjustments to GAAP net income this year due to noncash charges associated with the lump sum settlement of certain pension obligations. This relates to an offer we made to former employees to receive their benefits immediately as either a lump sum payment or an annuity rather than waiting till they become retirement eligible. The purpose of this program is to reduce the financial volatility associated with our frozen defined benefit plan. You can pick up more details in today's press release but the short story is that we reduced our pension liability by about $70 million with no increase in required cash contributions to the plan. 
We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on fixed capital and IT projects in 2016 and expect to incur about $25 million in cash restructuring charges, which together represent a $20 million increase over our level of spending last year. In light of the higher CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow conversion of roughly 100% of adjusted net income. We do, however, continue to expect cumulative free cash flow conversion over the coming years to exceed 100%. Importantly, while the continued currency headwind pull our 2016 EPS growth rate lower long-term target, our guidance for the year is consistent with the progress we believe is necessary to achieve our key long-term financial target. 
In summary, we delivered another quarter and year of solid earnings per share growth despite a number of challenges. Our 2 market leading core businesses are well-positioned for profitable growth, which combined with our continued focus on productivity and capital discipline, enable us to extend margins and increase returns and achieve our 2018 targets.

India, ASEAN, very strong throughout the year and China was the one area where I think we were continuously disappointed in for the last, well, for the last 5 quarters. Our hypothesis is that inventories in that market were kind of full and we tried customers telling us anecdotally that they just didn't have the sales. We did see some shift in that trend but we also are tapping into a pretty high growth area in China, something called a logistics label. It's a little more sophisticated than a barcode label. But fundamentally, it's growth driver is the rapid acceleration of online ordering and everything's delivered to your home, much as we do here in the U.S. So in the long run, we're still bullish on China because the Materials business there is really linked to consumer spending and as that economy begins to shift to a more services-based in consumer spending model, that should bode well for us in the long term. However, I wouldn't be surprised if we see continued volatility in China. But I don't have any specific note on that."

I think largely, what you're seeing is that we've done a good job of doing that, of rebalancing those dynamics and we talked about getting more disciplined in the less differentiated segments within PSM and we've done that as well and the focus is how do we continue to drive growth profitably across all the segments."

We're off a very good start to the year on several fronts, including better than expected earnings growth.

We also signed a definitive agreement to acquire Mactac Europe from Platinum Equity. This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy to enhance our competitiveness in high-value pressure sensitive materials for graphics applications. Mactac complements our existing business with a strong brand and loyal customer base, expanding our product offering, capabilities and distributor network. 
Our consistently strong operating performance along with the disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation plan is testament to the strategic foundations we've laid as well as to the strength and depth of our leadership team. I'm happy to say that the leadership transition we have had underway been seamless. As we announced in February, I am formally handing over the CEO reins to Mitch this week. I will stay on the board as Executive Chairman, with Mitch joining the Board following his election at tomorrow's shareholder meeting.
Since joining Avery Dennison in 2000, Mitch has worked in various businesses and regions across the company and in roles of increasing responsibility. He has been a close partner of mine and has been at the center of our most successful business strategies. Most recently, he was the driver behind our focus on the high-value market segments of our portfolio while making the investments necessary to be competitive across all product segments.

You've taken Avery Dennison up to new highs and I'm extremely honored to be able to build on your legacy as I become the next CEO, and I'm grateful to be able to continue to tap your vast experience and your role as Chairman.
This is a great company with great people and I could not be more confident in the company's position nor more excited by our prospects. As CEO, my focus remains the same, ensuring the long-term success of the company by delivering exceptional value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
Our 2 industry-leading core businesses are well positioned for profitable growth. That growth combined with our constant focus on productivity and capital discipline will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
As Dean said, we're pleased to report a very good start to the year. We beat our expeditions for Q1 EPS by a few cents, reflecting continued outperformance in Pressure-sensitive Materials. Our consistently strong performance speaks to the strategic foundations we've laid. We are focused on driving profitable growth through differentiated quality, service and innovation with the specific goal to accelerate growth in high-value market segments that have above-average growth and margin potential, such as tapes, graphics, RFID and emerging markets. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership positions in these key segments. 
In addition, driving growth in high-value categories, we're also focused on driving more profitable growth in those that are less differentiated, such as base materials for barcode labels in pressure-sensitive Materials and the value and contemporary segments of RBIS. We are increasing our competitiveness here by lowering our costs and tailoring our go-to-market strategies.
And finally, productivity improvement remains a top priority. This has been a core strength of ours over the years and it is something we will continue to focus on through a continued deployment of lean and 6 Sigma, ongoing innovations and product reengineering and investments in automation and restructuring. I want to stress that our productivity focus is not just about lowering costs and expanding margins, both of which are crucial, but also about becoming more competitive so we can grow profitably and better serve the less differentiated segments of our markets.
Now let me describe how these strategic priorities are playing out within each of our businesses. As you know, our goal in PSM is to create value by growing the top line of this high return business at 4% to 5% organically while expanding operating margin. And I'm pleased to say that the team adduced delivered on both fronts. This business has consistently generated solid organic growth for the past 4 years and Q1 is no exception with 4% organic growth, driven by emerging markets and strength in Graphics and labeled materials. We see opportunities to continue expanding in such high-value categories and we are investing to support this growth including through acquisitions. The Mactac deal is an excellent case in point. I'll comment more on that in just a moment.
As for the less differentiated product categories, I am pleased to say we have made good progress on this over the past year and saw a continuation of that trend in Q1. We have more to do on this front but overall, good progress.
As I said, our acquisition of Mactac Europe demonstrates the execution of our strategic priority to further penetrate high-value segments as this acquisition enhances our position in both graphics and tapes. This is a classic bolt-on acquisition that meets all of our physical financial criteria for acquisitions.
Mactac is known in Europe for its high-quality pressure-sensitive graphic materials with products and capabilities that are complementary to our existing business. It has a loyal customer base and gives us access to new distributors. Incidentally, given the high customer loyalty and opportunity to broaden our distribution network, we intend to maintain the Mactac brand in Europe and Mactac's manufacturing facility in Belgium adds new capacity to support growth for both graphics and tapes.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. The RBIS team continues to win in high-value categories. Sales for radio frequency identification products grew by more than 70% in Q1 and sales growth for the performance athletic brand was solid once again. Furthermore, the team continues to execute well on its business model transformation, which will enable this business to win in the less differentiated value and contemporary segments while driving significant margin expansion. To this end, we are executing an aggressive set of restructuring and other productivity designed to put RBIS back on the margin expansion trajectory necessary to achieve our long-term financial goals.
Let me remind you that this multiyear transformation what it entails. We are reducing our fixed cost, localizing our material sourcing and responding more quickly to changes in our customer needs by decentralizing decision-making. In short, we are rapidly moving to a business model that is making us more competitive. We are seeing early signs of success from this change as we realized core volume gains in the value segment. Now, volumes for core products among the department stores, what we call contemporary segment, are still down due in large part of the challenges that these customers face in their own markets.
Overall, the RBIS team is making solid progress against the transformation and we are pleased with the results on the top and bottom line in the quarter. That said, the second quarter will be a key test for us as it is the seasonally most important quarter for this business.
Turning out to Vancive Medical Technologies. First quarter results were simply disappointing with significant drop in sales. While our long-term new product platform continues to gain traction, we have been losing ground with respect to our core product pipeline. We began taking actions mid last year that are beginning to refill that pipeline but it will take them to recover due to the long sales cycle in this business. We are committed to achieving consistent growth in our long-term margin objectives for Vancive. 
Coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.08, reflecting some relief from currency headwinds as well as the strong results we delivered in the first quarter.
Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. We plan to continue to drive outside growth in high-value segments, relentlessly focused on productivity to improve our competitiveness in less differentiated segments and drive margin expansion, maintain our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth, and continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.

Currency translation reduced reported sales by 5.6% in the first qu",1014,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. I'll provide a little more color on the quarter. 
In Q1, we delivered a 16% [ph] increase and adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth.  Currency translation reduced reported sales by 5.6% in the first quarter with an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS. 
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 130 basis points to 9.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee related costs. We realized about $27 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs.
The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Free cash flow was a negative $37 million, about $18 million lower than Q1 of last year primarily due to higher bonus payments associated with our strong performance last year. We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares in the quarter and paid $33 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 0.8 million for a net cost of $80 million. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample capacity to fund both the Mactac acquisition as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
As Mitch mentioned earlier, the Mactac deal aligns with those strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions. Not only do we expect to be EPS accretive within 12 months, but we also expect to generate a rate of return in excess of our cost of capital within 18 months. We expect to close this deal within a few months and we anticipate that the transaction will have an immaterial impact to EPS this year and expect an approximate $0.10 benefit to EPS next year. That $0.10 benefit is net of interest costs, amortization of intangibles and certain transition costs and it corresponds to EBITDA of roughly EUR 25 million next year.
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis. Traditionally, emerging markets have been a big driver of our growth in PSM. We saw a reverse of that trend last year when faster growth in mature markets picked up the slack for slower than usual growth in China and other parts of the world. In Q1, we returned to the normal trend. Specifically, we saw a return to modest growth in North America and Western Europe, low single digits for both, while emerging markets grew at a high single-digit rate. As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth within PSM's higher value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, we grew faster than average in specialty films and papers, and Graphics grew by more than 10%. PSM's adjusted operating margin of 12.9% was up 140 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from productivity and higher volume more than offset employee related costs. 
Once again, the team delivered the vast majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity effort, including engineered reductions in raw material costs as well as restructuring initiatives. While we saw a benefit from deflation net of price in the quarter, it was very modest. 
Shifting out to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Coincidentally, the organic growth and margin expansion for RBIS was identical to PSM. Sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. Sales growth for the segment was driven largely by radio frequency identification products. RFID sales exceeded our expectations for the quarter with organic growth of more than 70%.  
The comps for RFID significantly more challenging in the second half, but we continue to expect better than 20% growth for the full year. Adjusting for the impact of RFID, we saw solid growth in the performance segment. This was not withstanding a tough comp up against last year's first quarter. 
Sales of external embellishments were soft in the quarter mostly due to timing of orders. We're confident we'll see this part of the business pick up over the course of the year.
As Mitch indicated, the growth trend for core, less differentiated products remains mixed. Key parameter for us here. In contrast, the recent quarters, sales growth among European retailers and brand owners outpaced the U.S. counterparts partly due to is your comparison. RBIS operating margin improvement reflected the net benefit of initiatives and higher volumes, which more than offset higher employee related costs. As the team continues to execute its aggressive transformation program, we anticipate continued margin expansion over the balance of the year.
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by approximately 18% on an organic basis due in part to difficult prior comparison related to the specific customer. Even with the lost profits associated with the sales decline, the segment's operating loss came to modestly, reflecting the actions we took last year to take down our investment in sensors. We expect improvement over the balance of the year in terms of both the top and bottom line.
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the midpoint of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.08, with an updated range of $3.75 to $3.90. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials.  The only assumption that has changed here is the impact of currency. Specifically at recent exchange rates, we now estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2% and pretax earnings by roughly $15 million or an estimated $0.11 per share. This compares to our previous estimates of reduction at 3.5% to sales and $0.18 to EPS. The rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.
So just wrapping up. We're very pleased with our strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies including the disciplined allocation of capital. 
Now, we'll open the call up for your questions."

And so, we think we're seeing good signs. It's been consistent in the last few quarters from volume growth perspective. Good trajectory there. In the contemporary or the department stores, we are still seeing volumes down and a lot of that has to do with the some challenges that the number of the department stores are seeing in their own marketplace today. As far as what customers are telling us, it's hard to give you an average. If you look at it, there's a number of customers that are doing quite well, a number of retailers and brands, and there's a number of that are having their own challenges that work through things. So overall, we're coming off of a winter season that was a lackluster from a retail sales perspective. And so, a number of the retailers have more inventory than they want to be having right now. And that is factoring into their thinking. On a broad base, if had to characterize, I'd say cautious optimism is what the retailers and brands are looking at.

As far as SG&A, as we've talked about, we've had a significant restructuring program, especially in RBIS, where a majority of their savings are coming through the SG&A line. So when you look at SG&A savings, the productivity restructuring is driving the improvement overall.

As far as -- if you look at where the margins are in Q1, hence comments we're comping from Q1 where we're expecting it to go forward, you normally have a seasonal reduction in those margins in the second half late in the year. So we just want to highlight that there's some seasonal adjustments. We've got the impact of lower -- the tapes decline of 1 customer, which will have an impact. And the -- from a -- just purely from the purchase prices we have for raw materials and the selling prices, it was a modest benefit. And there was definitely some deflation in North America. And as we've talked about last time, we've actually been adjusting our own prices to our customers in those segments that are impacted the most. So it's -- we're at peak levels. You don't want to lock on this time you can get to a new level and say, this is something you should baseline your models on, how you're thinking about it. I will tell you our focus here is about growing this business and growing it profitably and continuing to see opportunities on how we can further expand margins, which also fits, and this is a great business and this is a great platform.

We also signed a definitive agreement to acquire Mactac Europe from Platinum Equity. This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy to enhance our competitiveness in high-value pressure-sensitive materials for graphics applications. Mactac complements our existing business with a strong brand and loyal customer base, expanding our product offering, capabilities and distributor network.
Our consistently strong operating performance, along with the disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation plan, is testament to the strategic foundations we've laid as well as to the strength and depth of our leadership team.

You've taken Avery Dennison to new heights, and I'm extremely honored to be able to build on your legacy as I become the next CEO, and I'm grateful to be able to continue to tap your vast experience and your role as Chairman.
This is a great company with great people, and I could not be more confident in the company's position nor more excited by our prospects. As CEO, my focus remains the same, ensuring the long-term success of the company by delivering exceptional value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
Our 2 industry-leading core businesses are well positioned for profitable growth. That growth, combined with our constant focus on productivity and capital discipline, will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
As Dean said, we're pleased to report a very good start to the year. We beat our expectations for Q1 EPS by a few cents, reflecting continued outperformance in Pressure-sensitive Materials. Our consistently strong performance speaks to the strategic foundations we've laid. We are focused on driving profitable growth through differentiated quality, service and innovation with the specific goal to accelerate growth in high-value market segments that have above-average growth and margin potential such as tapes, graphics, RFID and emerging markets. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership positions in these key segments.
In addition to driving growth in high-value categories, we are also focused on driving more profitable growth in those that are less differentiated such as base materials for barcode labels in Pressure-sensitive and the value and contemporary segments of RBIS. We are increasing our competitiveness here by lowering our costs and tailoring our go-to-market strategies.
And finally, productivity improvement remains a top priority. This has been a core strength of ours over the years, and it is something we will continue to focus on through continued deployment of Lean and Six Sigma, ongoing innovation in product reengineering and investments in automation and restructuring. I want to stress that our productivity focus is not just about lowering costs and expanding margins, both of which are crucial, but also about becoming more competitive so we can grow profitably and better serve the less differentiated segments of our markets.
Now let me describe how these strategic priorities are playing out within each of our businesses. As you know, our goal in PSM is to create value by growing the top line of this high-return business at 4% to 5% organically while expanding operating margin. And I am pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. This business has consistently generated solid organic growth for the past 4 years, and Q1 was no exception, with 4% organic growth, driven by emerging markets and strength in graphics and specialty label materials. We see opportunities to continue expanding in such high-value categories and are investing to support this growth, including through acquisitions. The Mactac deal is an excellent case in point. I'll comment more on that in just a moment.
As for the less differentiated product categories, I am pleased to say we have made good progress on this over the past year and saw a continuation of that trend in Q1. We have more to do on this front but, overall, good progress.
As I said, our acquisition of Mactac Europe demonstrates the execution of our strategic priority to further penetrate high-value segments as this acquisition enhances our position in both graphics and tapes. This is a classic bolt-on acquisition that meets all of our strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions.
Mactac is known in Europe for its high-quality pressure-sensitive graphic materials with products and capabilities that are complementary to our existing business. It has a loyal customer base and gives us access to new distributors. Incidentally, given the high customer loyalty and opportunity to broaden our distributor network, we intend to maintain the Mactac brand in Europe. And Mactac's manufacturing facility in Belgium adds new capacity to support growth for both graphics and tapes.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. The RBIS team continues to win in high-value categories. Sales for radio frequency identification products grew by more than 70% in Q1, and sales growth for the performance athletic brand was solid once again. Furthermore, the team continues to execute well on its business model transformation, which will enable this business to win in the less differentiated value and contemporary segments while driving significant margin expansion. To this end, we are executing an aggressive set of restructuring and other productivity actions designed to put RBIS back on the margin expansion trajectory necessary to achieve our long-term financial goals.
Let me remind you that this multiyear transformation -- what it entails. We are reducing our fixed costs, localizing our material sourcing and responding more quickly to changes in our customer needs by decentralizing decision-making. In short, we are rapidly moving to a business model that is making us more competitive. We are seeing early signs of success from this change as we've realized core volume gains in the value segment. Now volumes for core products among the department stores, what we call contemporary segment, are still down due in large part to the challenges that these customers face in their own markets.
Overall, the RBIS team is making solid progress against the transformation, and we are pleased with the results on the top and bottom line in the quarter. That said, the second quarter will be a key test for us as it is the seasonally most important quarter for this business.
Turning now to Vancive Medical Technologies. First quarter results were simply disappointing with a significant drop in sales. While our long-term new product platform continues to gain traction, we have been losing ground with respect to our core product pipeline. We began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill that pipeline, but it will take time to recover due to the long sales cycle in this business. We are committed to achieving consistent growth in our long-term margin objectives for Vancive.
Coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.08, reflecting some relief from currency headwinds as well as the strong results we delivered in the first quarter.
Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. We plan to continue to drive outsized growth in high-value segments, relentlessly focus on productivity to improve our competitiveness in less differentiated segments and drive margin expansion, maintain our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

Currency translation reduced reported sales by 5.6% in the first quarter,",1015,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everyone. I'll provide a little more color on the quarter.
In Q1, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth.  Currency translation reduced reported sales by 5.6% in the first quarter, with an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS.
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 130 basis points to 9.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs. We realized about $27 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges, net of transition costs.
The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Free cash flow was a negative $37 million, about $18 million lower than Q1 of last year, primarily due to higher bonus payments associated with our strong performance last year.
We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares in the quarter and paid $33 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 0.8 million for a net cost of $80 million.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund both the Mactac acquisition as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
As Mitch mentioned earlier, the Mactac deal aligns with both our strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions. Not only do we expect to be EPS accretive within 12 months, but we also expect it to generate a rate of return in excess of our cost of capital within 18 months. We expect to close this deal within a few months, and we anticipate that the transaction will have an immaterial impact to EPS this year and expect an approximately $0.10 benefit to EPS next year. That $0.10 benefit is net of interest costs, amortization of intangibles and certain transition costs, and it corresponds to EBITDA of roughly EUR 25 million next year.
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis. Traditionally, emerging markets have been a big driver of our growth in PSM. We saw a reverse of that trend last year when faster growth in mature markets picked up the slack for slower-than-usual growth in China and other parts of the world. In Q1, we returned to the normal trend. Specifically, we saw a return to more modest growth in North America and Western Europe, low single digits for both, while emerging markets grew at a high single-digit rate.
As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth within PSM's higher-value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, we grew faster than average in specialty films and papers, and graphics grew by more than 10%. PSM's adjusted operating margin of 12.9% was up 140 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from productivity and higher volume more than offset employee-related costs.
Once again, the team delivered the vast majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity effort, including engineered reductions in raw material costs as well as restructuring initiatives. While we saw a benefit from deflation, net of price, in the quarter, it was very modest.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Coincidentally, the organic growth and margin expansion for RBIS was identical to PSM. Sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. Sales growth for the segment was driven largely by radio frequency identification products. RFID sales exceeded our expectations for the quarter with organic growth of more than 70%.
The comps for RFID was significantly more challenging in the second half, but we continue to expect better than 20% growth for the full year. Adjusting for the impact of RFID, we saw solid growth in the performance segment. This was not withstanding a tough comp against last year's first quarter.
Sales of external embellishments were soft in the quarter, mostly due to timing of orders. We're confident we'll see this part of the business pick up over the course of the year.
As Mitch indicated, the growth trend for core, less differentiated products remains mixed. Q2 remains the key parameter for us here. In contrast to recent quarters, sales growth among European retailers and brand owners outpaced the U.S. counterparts, partly due to easier comparison.
RBIS operating margin improvement reflected the net benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. As the team continues to execute its aggressive transformation program, we anticipate continued margin expansion over the balance of the year.
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by approximately 18% on an organic basis due in part to a difficult prior comparison related to a specific customer. Even with the lost profits associated with this sales decline, the segment's operating loss came down modestly, reflecting the actions we took last year to sit down our investment in wearable sensors. We expect improvement over the balance of the year in terms of both the top and bottom line.
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the midpoint of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.08, with an updated range of $3.75 to $3.90. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials.  The only assumption that has changed here is the impact of currency. Specifically, at recent exchange rates, we now estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2% and pretax earnings by roughly $15 million or an estimated $0.11 per share. This compares to our previous estimates of reduction of 3.5% to sales and $0.18 to EPS. The rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.
So just wrapping up. We're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital.
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

However, that's being offset by pretty phenomenal growth in ASEAN as well as in India. So that's what's going on with the growth trajectory and the margins.

And so we think we're seeing good signs. It's been consistent the last few quarters from volume growth perspective. Good trajectory there. In the contemporary or the department stores, we are still seeing volumes down, and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges that a number of the department stores are seeing in their own marketplace today. As far as what customers are telling us, it's hard to give you an average. If you look at it, there's a number of customers that are doing quite well, a number of retailers and brands, and there's a number that are having their own challenges that they work through things. So overall, we're coming off of a winter season that was a little lackluster from a retail sales perspective. And so a number of the retailers from that have more inventory than they want to be having right now, and that is factoring into their thinking. On a broad base, if I had to characterize, I'd say cautious optimism is what the retailers and brands are looking at. And those that are even struggling, everybody's looking to get more productivity out of their existing retail footprint, and it's something what we can help them achieve that, particularly with RFID, and that's the focus of the conversations."

And our productivity initiatives that is a core strength of ours, we continue to execute on, and have consistently done that and will continue to do that. As far as -- if you look at where the margins are in Q1, hence the comments we're comping from Q1 where we're expecting it to go forward, you normally have a seasonal reduction in those margins in the second half, late in the year. So we just want to highlight that there's some seasonal adjustments. We've got the impact of lower -- the tapes decline of one customer, which will have an impact. And the -- from a -- just purely from the purchase prices we have for raw materials and the selling prices, it was a modest benefit. And there was definitely some deflation in North America. And as we've talked about last time, we've actually been adjusting our own prices to our customers in those segments that are impacted the most. So it's -- we're at peak levels. You don't want to lock on. This time you can get to a new level and say, this is something you should baseline your models on and how you're thinking about it. I will tell you, our focus here is about growing this business and growing it profitably and continuing to see opportunities for how we can further expand margins, which also fit -- and this is a great business and a great platform. That links right into why we're trying to penetrate this space even more aggressively with acquisitions like Mactac."

We also signed a definitive agreement to acquire Mactac Europe from Platinum Equity. This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy to enhance our competitiveness in high-value pressure-sensitive materials for graphics applications. Mactac complements our existing business with a strong brand and loyal customer base, expanding our product offering, capabilities and distributor network.
Our consistently strong operating performance, along with the disciplined execution of our long-term capital allocation plan, is testament to the strategic foundations we've laid as well as to the strength and depth of our leadership team.

I will stay on the board as Executive Chairman, with Mitch joining the board following his election at tomorrow's Shareholder Meeting.
Since joining Avery Dennison in 2000, Mitch has worked in various businesses and regions across the company and in roles of increasing responsibility. He has been a close partner of mine and has been at the center of our most successful business strategies. Most recently, he was the driver behind our focus on the high-value market segments of our portfolio while making the investments necessary to be competitive across all product segments.

You've taken Avery Dennison to new heights, and I'm extremely honored to be able to build on your legacy as I become the next CEO, and I'm grateful to be able to continue to tap your vast experience and your role as Chairman.
This is a great company with great people, and I could not be more confident in the company's position nor more excited by our prospects. As CEO, my focus remains the same, ensuring the long-term success of the company by delivering exceptional value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
Our 2 industry-leading core businesses are well positioned for profitable growth. That growth, combined with our constant focus on productivity and capital discipline, will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.
As Dean said, we're pleased to report a very good start to the year. We beat our expectations for Q1 EPS by a few cents, reflecting continued outperformance in Pressure-sensitive Materials. Our consistently strong performance speaks to the strategic foundations we've laid. We are focused on driving profitable growth through differentiated quality, service and innovation with the specific goal to accelerate growth in high-value market segments that have above-average growth and margin potential such as tapes, graphics, RFID and emerging markets. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership positions in these key segments.
In addition to driving growth in high-value categories, we are also focused on driving more profitable growth in those that are less differentiated such as base materials for barcode labels in Pressure-sensitive and the value and contemporary segments of RBIS. We are increasing our competitiveness here by lowering our costs and tailoring our go-to-market strategies.
And finally, productivity improvement remains a top priority. This has been a core strength of ours over the years, and it is something we will continue to focus on through continued deployment of Lean and Six Sigma, ongoing innovation in product re-engineering and investments in automation and restructuring. I want to stress that our core activity focus is not just about lowering costs and expanding margins, both of which are crucial, but also about becoming more competitive so we can grow profitably and better serve the less differentiated segments of our markets.
Now let me describe how these strategic priorities are playing out within each of our businesses. As you know, our goal in PSM is to create value by growing the top line of this high-return business at 4% to 5% organically while expanding operating margin. And I am pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. This business has consistently generated solid organic growth for the past 4 years, and Q1 was no exception, with 4% organic growth, driven by emerging markets and strength in graphics and specialty label materials. We see opportunities to continue expanding in such high-value categories and are investing to support this growth, including through acquisitions. The Mactac deal is an excellent case in point. I'll comment more on that in just a moment.
As for the less differentiated product categories, I am pleased to say we have made good progress on this over the past year and saw a continuation of that trend in Q1. We have more to do on this front but, overall, good progress.
As I said, our acquisition of Mactac Europe demonstrates the execution of our strategic priority to further penetrate high-value segments as this acquisition enhances our position in both graphics and tapes. This is a classic bolt-on acquisition that meets all of our strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions.
Mactac is known in Europe for its high-quality pressure-sensitive graphic materials with products and capabilities that are complementary to our existing business. It has a loyal customer base and gives us access to new distributors. Incidentally, given the high customer loyalty and opportunity to broaden our distributor network, we intend to maintain the Mactac brand in Europe. And Mactac's manufacturing facility in Belgium adds needed capacity to support growth for both graphics and tapes.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. The RBIS team continues to win in high-value categories. Sales for radio frequency identification products grew by more than 70% in Q1, and sales growth for the performance athletic brand was solid once again. Furthermore, the team continues to execute well on its business model transformation, which will enable this business to win in the less differentiated value and contemporary segments while driving significant margin expansion. To this end, we are executing an aggressive set of restructuring and other productivity actions designed to put RBIS back on the margin expansion trajectory necessary to achieve our long-term financial goals.
Let me remind you that this multiyear transformation -- what it entails. We are reducing our fixed costs, localizing our material sourcing and responding more quickly to changes in our customer needs by decentralizing decision-making. In short, we are rapidly moving to a business model that is making us more competitive. We are seeing early signs of success from this change as we've realized core volume gains in the value segment. Now volumes for core products among the department stores, what we call contemporary segment, are still down due in large part to the challenges that these customers face in their own markets.
Overall, the RBIS team is making solid progress against the transformation, and we are pleased with the results on the top and bottom line in the quarter. That said, the second quarter will be a key test for us as it is the seasonally most important quarter for this business.
Turning now to Vancive Medical Technologies. First quarter results were simply disappointing with a significant drop in sales. While our long-term new product platform continues to gain traction, we have been losing ground with respect to our core product pipeline. We began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill that pipeline, but it will take time to recover due to the long sales cycle in this business. We are committed to achieving consistent growth in our long-term margin objectives for Vancive.
Coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.08, reflecting some relief from currency headwinds as well as the strong results we delivered in the first quarter.
Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. We plan to continue to drive outsized growth in high-value segments, relentlessly focus on productivity to improve our competitiveness in less differentiated segments and drive margin expansion, maintain our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

In Q1, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth.  Currency translation reduced reported sales by 5.6% in the first quarter, with an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS.
Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 130 basis points to 9.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs. We realized about $27 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges, net of transition costs.
The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Free cash flow was a negative $37 million, about $18 million lower than Q1 of last year, primarily due to higher bonus payments associated with our strong performance last year.
We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares in the quarter and paid $33 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 0.8 million for a net cost of $80 million.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund both the Mactac acquisition as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
As Mitch mentioned earlier, the Mactac deal aligns with both our strategic and financial criteria for acquisitions. Not only do we expect to be EPS accretive within 12 months, but we also expect it to generate a rate of return in excess of our cost of capital within 18 months. We expect to close this deal within a few months, and we anticipate that the transaction will have an immaterial impact to EPS this year and expect an approximately $0.10 benefit to EPS next year. That $0.10 benefit is net of interest costs, amortization of intangibles and certain transition costs, and it corresponds to EBITDA of roughly EUR 25 million next year.
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis. Traditionally, emerging markets have been a big driver of our growth in PSM. We saw a reverse of that trend last year when faster growth in mature markets picked up the slack for slower-than-usual growth in China and other parts of the world. In Q1, we returned to the normal trend. Specifically, we saw a return to more modest growth in North America and Western Europe, low single digits for both, while emerging markets grew at a high single-digit rate.
As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth within PSM's higher-value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, we grew faster than average in specialty films and papers, and graphics grew by more than 10%. PSM's adjusted operating margin of 12.9% was up 140 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from productivity and higher volume more than offset employee-related costs.
Once again, the team delivered the vast majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity effort, including engineered reductions in raw material costs as well as restructuring initiatives. While we saw a benefit from deflation, net of price, in the quarter, it was very modest.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Coincidentally, the organic growth and margin expansion for RBIS was identical to PSM. Sales were up approximately 4% on an organic basis, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points. Sales growth for the segment was driven largely by radio frequency identification products. RFID sales exceeded our expectations for the quarter with organic growth of more than 70%.
The comps for RFID was significantly more challenging in the second half, but we continue to expect better than 20% growth for the full year. Adjusting for the impact of RFID, we saw solid growth in the performance segment. This was not withstanding a tough comp against last year's first quarter.
Sales of external embellishments were soft in the quarter, mostly due to timing of orders. We're confident we'll see this part of the business pick up over the course of the year.
As Mitch indicated, the growth trend for core, less differentiated products remains mixed. Q2 remains the key parameter for us here. In contrast to recent quarters, sales growth among European retailers and brand owners outpaced the U.S. counterparts, partly due to easier comparison.
RBIS operating margin improvement reflected the net benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume, which more than offset higher employee-related costs. As the team continues to execute its aggressive transformation program, we anticipate continued margin expansion over the balance of the year.
Sales in Vancive Medical Technologies declined by approximately 18% on an organic basis due in part to a difficult prior comparison related to a specific customer. Even with the lost profits associated with this sales decline, the segment's operating loss came down modestly, reflecting the actions we took last year to sit down our investment in wearable sensors. We expect improvement over the balance of the year in terms of both the top and bottom line.
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the midpoint of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.08, with an updated range of $3.75 to $3.90. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials.  The only assumption that has changed here is the impact of currency. Specifically, at recent exchange rates, we now estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2% and pretax earnings by roughly $15 million or an estimated $0.11 per share. This compares to our previous estimates of reduction of 3.5% to sales and $0.18 to EPS. The rest of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter.
So just wrapping up. We're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital.
Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

And so we think we're seeing good signs. It's been consistent the last few quarters from volume growth perspective. Good trajectory there. In the contemporary or the department stores, we are still seeing volumes down, and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges that a number of the department stores are seeing in their own marketplace today. As far as what customers are telling us, it's hard to give you an average. If you look at it, there's a number of customers that are doing quite well, a number of retailers and brands, and there's a number that are having their own challenges that they work through things. So overall, we're coming off of a winter season that was a little lackluster from a retail sales perspective. And so a number of the retailers from that have more inventory than they want to be having right now, and that is factoring into their thinking. On a broad base, if I had to characterize, I'd say cautious optimism is what the retailers and brands are looking at. And those that are even struggling, everybody's looking to get more productivity out of their existing retail footprint, and it's something what we can help them achieve that, particularly with RFID, and that's the focus of the conversations."

And our productivity initiatives that is a core strength of ours, we continue to execute on, and have consistently done that and will continue to do that. As far as -- if you look at where the margins are in Q1, hence the comments we're comping from Q1 where we're expecting it to go forward, you normally have a seasonal reduction in those margins in the second half, late in the year. So we just want to highlight that there's some seasonal adjustments. We've got the impact of lower -- the tapes decline of one customer, which will have an impact. And the -- from a -- just purely from the purchase prices we have for raw materials and the selling prices, it was a modest benefit. And there was definitely some deflation in North America. And as we've talked about last time, we've actually been adjusting our own prices to our customers in those segments that are impacted the most. So it's -- we're at peak levels. You don't want to lock on. This time you can get to a new level and say, this is something you should baseline your models on and how you're thinking about it. I will tell you, our focus here is about growing this business and growing it profitably and continuing to see opportunities for how we can further expand margins, which also fit -- and this is a great business and a great platform. That links right into why we're trying to penetrate this space even more aggressively with acquisitions like Mactac."

I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. We continue to drive",776,"Thanks, Demmy, and good day, everyone. I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. 
We continue to drive above-average growth in high-value products segments and improved our competitiveness and profitability across the entire portfolio, and we're making good progress with our business model transformation in RBIS. 
So starting with Pressure-sensitive Materials. As you know, our goal in PSM has been to create value by organically growing the top line of this high return business at 4% to 5%, while expanding operating margins. And I'm pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. 
In the second quarter, we grew PSM sales by nearly 5% on an organic basis and expanded adjusted operating margins to a new high of 13.5%. Once again, the emerging markets were a key growth driver, up 10% in the quarter. 
From a product perspective, high-value graphics in specialty labels and materials continue to grow at rates well above the segment average, while sales declined for Performance Tapes due largely to the loss of a specific customer application as we discussed before. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our progress in shipping PSM's portfolio mix towards the higher-valued categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas, including acquisitions exemplified by the Mactac deal that we announced in April. 
As for the base business within PSM, what we have often referred to as less differentiated products, we continue to deliver in the second quarter with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across the board. 
Speaking of which, overall profitability for PSM exceeded our expectations, reflecting leverage on strong volume growth, continued disciplined with respect to pricing in the base business and of course, exceptional execution on the productivity front. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically, driven by Radio Frequency Identification. I'm happy to report that RFID sales were up nearly 50% in Q2. 
The case for RFID is clear, and we remain the go-to supplier in the market so expect it to continue to be a key growth driver market for us going forward. 
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter, amidst the challenging apparel market. In particular, continued challenges experienced by the department stores and inventory reduction associated with athletic goods store closures. 
That said, we are seeing signs of success from our multi-year transformation strategy, becoming faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion. 
Specifically, we saw solid volume gains in both the value and fast fashion segment of the market during Q2 and unit volume for the department stores were relatively stable, an improvement over recent trends. 
We are also on track to deliver planned restructuring savings from the transformation. With these actions we're taking to improve our competitiveness in the base business, along with a list from RFID, even in a relatively modest apparel retail market, I am confident that we'll achieve our 2018 margin target for RBIS. 
Now looking at Vancive Medical Technologies. While this business reported solid margin expansion in the quarter, we are not yet performing at the level we expect.  We've began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill our product pipeline and have recently reestablished the organization between Vancive and Performance Tapes business. 
Long term, these actions combined with strong growth from our new product platform should enable us to deliver consistent organic growth and double-digit margins in this business. 
So coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, reflecting the strong results we delivered in the second quarter. 
Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. 
First and foremost, being our focus on driving outside growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments. 
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and of course, drive margin expansion. 
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency, while increasing investments to support profitable growth. And of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

In Q2, we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth. 
Currency translation were due to reported sales by 1.7% in the second quarter with an approximately $0.03 impact on EPS. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter improved 120 basis points to 10.7% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs and higher employee-related expenses. 
We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges to net of transition cost. 
The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. 
Year-to-date, free cash flow was $152 million, an increase of $38 million compared to last year, reflecting the increase in earnings and timing of tax payments. 
During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares and paid $70 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 1.2 million through a net cost of $190 million, bringing the total amount of cash, return to shareholders so far this year to roughly $190 million. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund acquisitions as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 5% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth for this segment, with organic growth of 10%, emerging markets represented a majority of the segment's top line growth in Q2, in line with the preceding quarter and our long-term expectations. 
A key exception to the strong growth trends is in China, where sales were roughly flat in the quarter on an organic basis. 
In North America, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, while Western Europe remains solid, up mid-single digits. As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth in many at PSM's higher-value segments. 
Within Label and Packaging Materials, specialty films and tape products were up 10% on an organic and graphics grew high single digits. 
In contrast, sales of Performance Tapes were down mid-single digits on an organic basis for the reasons we've discussed. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin of 13.5% was up 120 basis points over last year as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and a net impact of price and raw material input cost. 
And by the way, that net gap between deflation and pricing was a modest negative for the quarter. We want to highlight it given the change of direction from preceding quarters. 
Once again, the team delivered the majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity efforts, including product re-engineering and restructuring. 
Now shifting to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis, driven by growth of Radio Frequency Identification products, which were up nearly 50% in the quarter. We now anticipate full year sales for these products to be up more than 30% in 2015, recognizing that the comp is significantly more challenging in the second half. 
Adjusting for the impact of RFID, organic growth for core labels and tags were down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began to take late last year. As you know, we began lowering our prices in some categories late in 2015 to become more competitive. So the sales growth comparisons become easier in the work quarter. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong unit volume growth [indiscernible] 13 retailers and brand owners. This reflects excellent progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players. In contrast, unit volumes declined in the U.S., where we have a relatively high share position among department stores. Notwithstanding the modest volume growth and pricing adjustments we've made, adjusted operating margins for the segment improved by 30 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the restructuring and other cost-reduction actions we've taken to transform our business model.  We remain on track to achieve our margin target for this business by 2018. 
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the range of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 to $3.80 to $3.95. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material. Highlighting the changes from our previous guidance, we now expect the currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2.5% and pretax earnings by roughly $18 million for an estimated $0.13 per share, $0.02 worse than our April guidance. 
We have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 4% on an organic basis. We anticipate that the Mactac deal will close in August, resulting in roughly 1 point of incremental sale with an immaterial impact to EPS this year, reflecting various transition costs. We have reduced our estimate for severance and other restructuring-related costs included in reported EPS by approximately $0.05. 
So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we've made against our 2018 goals in the past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term to appear execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital.

So China was relatively flat as Anne commented on. Everything else has pretty exceptional growth. If you look at Southeast Asia, that was healthy double digits as was India and Eastern Europe return to good growth trajectory as well. Some of that, we think, as a little bit the pipeline fill within in the quarter, but even if you back that out, return to a healthy growth level. And Latin America, we continue to see solid growth a lot of that comes from pricing, as you know, but even on the volume front, we saw a return to growth, particularly in Brazil. Now some of that has to do with the elections that come up, they always have a benefit for us and not sure what the impact is specifically from the Olympics but we assume that, that had some positive lift as well. So pretty broad-based on the emerging market exposure, and you're seeing a little bit of shift. If you look at the last number of years, China was the lead driver of the emerging market growth, and we're starting to see there our strategy being the leader in all markets is paying off while China starts to slow down. The rest of the emerging markets is carrying the load. And then North America, we said, it was down modestly."

The other one, which certainly reduced exposure to apparel but does play the growth driver for us is the external embellishment so the heat transfer labels. This business, if you look 10 years ago, was only about the heat transfer label on the interior garment.

And it sounds like that's all going to continue, particularly with investment in accelerating the growth of those sorts of product lines.

Overall, and I think some of it reflects the types of garments, but with the exception of the impact of some inventory reductions that are impacting us in Q2 or impacted us in Q2, performance athletics, for example, high-value athletic garments have done and are expected to continue to do well. Fast fashion has done quite well in the market, so that's low cost, high churn, a lot of the fashion elements. That has done well and expected to do well the, which is one of the reasons why we are focusing on driving growth with that segment and taking share. Value continues to do well. And value actually has a range of -- value and contemporary a full range of high-end markets and more discount garments so it's hard to call out specifically what's winning within that space overall. But I think what you're seeing here is broad-based. We can even talk about the apartment stores, department stores are a number of them getting -- having some challenges right now and fast fashion is a particular growth driver within the industry."

So should we just very simply assume that the only -- the reason you took guidance by the amount that you beat 2Q is that where ever you're seeing improvement in Pressure-sensitive is being largely offset at this juncture by RBIS and Vancive in the back half of the year or will there be nuances around that?"

I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. We continue to drive",775,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. 
We continue to drive above-average growth in high-value products segments and improve our competitiveness and profitability across the entire portfolio, and we're making good progress with our business model transformation in RBIS. 
So starting with Pressure-sensitive Materials. As you know, our goal in PSM has been to create value by organically growing the top line of this high-return business at 4% to 5% while expanding operating margins. And I'm pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. In the second quarter, we grew PSM sales by nearly 5% on an organic basis and expanded adjusted operating margins to a new high of 13.5%. Once again, emerging markets were a key growth driver, up 10% in the quarter. 
From a product perspective, high-value graphics and specialty labels and materials continue to grow at rates well above the segment average, while sales declined for Performance Tapes due largely to the loss of a specific customer application, as we've discussed before. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our progress in shipping PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher-value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas, including acquisitions exemplified by the Mactac deal that we announced in April. 
As for the base business within PSM, what we have often referred to as less differentiated products, we continue to deliver in the second quarter, with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across the board. Speaking of which, overall profitability for PSM exceeded our expectations, reflecting leverage on strong volume growth; continued disciplined with respect to pricing in the base business; and of course, exceptional execution on the productivity front. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically, driven by Radio Frequency Identification. I'm happy to report that RFID sales were up nearly 50% in Q2. The case for RFID is clear, and we remain the go-to supplier in the market, so expect it to continue to be a key growth driver market for us going forward. 
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst the challenging apparel market, in particular, continued challenges experienced by the department stores and inventory reductions associated with athletic goods store closures. That said, we are seeing signs of success from our multiyear transformation strategy, becoming faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion. Specifically, we saw solid volume gains in both the value and fast fashion segments of the market during Q2. And unit volume for the department stores were relatively stable, an improvement over recent trends. 
We are also on track to deliver planned restructuring savings from the transformation. With these actions we're taking to improve our competitiveness in the base business, along with the lift from RFID, even in a relatively modest apparel retail market, I am confident we will achieve our 2018 margin target for RBIS. 
Now looking at Vancive Medical Technologies. While this business reported solid margin expansion in the quarter, we're not yet performing at the level we expect. We began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill our product pipeline and have recently reestablished the organizational link between our Vancive and Performance Tapes business. Long term, these actions, combined with strong growth from our new product platform, should enable us to deliver consistent organic growth and double-digit margins in this business. 
So coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, reflecting the strong results we delivered in the second quarter. Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies: first and foremost, meeting our focus on driving outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments. 
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and of course, drive margin expansion. 
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth. And of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

In Q2, we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the second quarter with an approximately $0.03 impact to EPS. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter improved 120 basis points to 10.7%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs and higher employee-related expenses. 
We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $152 million, an increase of $38 million compared to last year, reflecting the increase in earnings and timing of tax payments. 
During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares and paid $70 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 1.2 million for a net cost of $190 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $190 million. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund acquisitions as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 5% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth for this segment. With organic growth of 10%, emerging markets represented a majority of the segment's top line growth in Q2, in line with the preceding quarter and our long-term expectations. A key exception to this strong growth trend has been China, where sales were roughly flat in the quarter on an organic basis. 
In North America, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, while Western Europe remains solid, up mid-single digits. 
As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth in many of PSM's high-value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, specialty film and paper products were up 10% on an organic basis, and graphics grew high single digits. In contrast, sales of Performance Tapes were down mid-single digits on an organic basis for the reasons we've discussed. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin of 13.5% was up 120 basis points over the last year, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of price and raw material input costs. By the way, that net gap between deflation and pricing was a modest negative for the quarter. We wanted to highlight it, given the change in direction from preceding quarters. 
Once again, the team delivered the majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity efforts, including product re-engineering and restructuring. 
Now shifting to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis, driven by growth of Radio Frequency Identification products, which were up nearly 50% in the quarter. We now anticipate full year sales for these products to be up more than 30% in 2016, recognizing that the comps get significantly more challenging in the second half. 
Adjusting for the impact of RFID, organic growth for core labels and tags was down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began to take late last year. As you know, we began lowering our prices in some categories late in 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons become easier in the work quarter. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong unit volume growth for [indiscernible] 13 retailers and brand owners. This reflects excellent progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players. In contrast, unit volumes declined in the U.S., where we have a relatively high share position among department stores. Notwithstanding the modest volume growth and pricing adjustments we've made, adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 30 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the restructuring and other cost-reduction actions we've taken to transform our business model. We remain on track to achieve our margin target for this business by 2018. 
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the range of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 to $3.80 to $3.95. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material. Highlighting the changes from our previous guidance, we now expect that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2.5% and pretax earnings by roughly $18 million or an estimated $0.13 per share, $0.02 worse than our April guidance. 
We have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 4% on an organic basis. We anticipate that the Mactac deal will close in August, resulting in roughly a point of incremental sale with an immaterial impact to EPS this year, reflecting various transition costs. We have reduced our estimate for severance and other restructuring-related costs included in reported EPS by approximately $0.05. 
So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocations of capital. 
And now we'll open the call up for your questions."

Some of that, we think, is a little bit of pipeline fill within in the quarter. But even if you back that out, we've turned to a healthy growth level. And Latin America, we continue to see solid growth. A lot of that comes from pricing, as you know. But even on the volume front, we saw a return to growth, particularly in Brazil. Now some of that have to do with the elections that come up. They always have a benefit for us. And not sure what the impact is specifically from the Olympics, but we assume that, that has some positive lift as well. So pretty broad-based on the emerging market exposure. And you're seeing a little bit of shift. If you look at the last number of years, China was the lead driver of the emerging market growth, and we're starting to see that our strategy of being the leader in all markets is paying off because China starts to slow down.

The other one, which doesn't reduce that exposure to apparel but does create a growth driver for us, is the external embellishment, so the heat transfer labels. This business, if you look 10 years ago, was only about the heat transfer labels on the interior of the garment. We are going to the exterior of the garment, where it's actually part of the branding that is displayed, whether it be for brands or sports teams and so forth.

And then we've talked about tapes, the decline there on the volume side, well, that is a high-margin business, and so that will have a pretty decent impact on the margins as well. And as Anne said, full range of our guidance, we think, captures the full range of possible -- not possible outcomes, but probable outcomes. And the high end has roughly a continuation, excluding a little bit of the excess in Q2, a little bit of continuation of margin trends we saw into first half continuing into the second half with a normal seasonal drop and the impact of Performance Tapes."

Should we assume that all of that benefit has been basically used to grow market share through pricing and other actions?

Yes, so just the comment around RBIS is we're pleased with the progress we're making on the transformation, which we are very pleased with our growth that we're seeing in RFID. But that -- the growth organic growth of 2% plus in the quarter was short of our, obviously, long-term targets that we have for this business. And while it is largely due to the softness in the apparel market, we're looking to grow this business 4% to 5% long term. So I would say that we met our guidance expectations, given what was going on in the apparel market. We're pleased with the progress the team is making on the transformation, and we knew this was going to be a multiyear transformation as well. So yes, there's more. We're continuing to focus on how -- where can we get less complex, simpler, if you will, and more competitive across the entire customer base. So this is something that we will continue to be focused on. And I think it's important that you step back. I mean, yes, the top line has been less consistent, if you will, but we have continued to grow this business over the last number of years. And regardless of market environment, we have consistently expanded margin over -- each of the years over the last 5 years.

I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. We continue to drive",774,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. 
We continue to drive above-average growth in high-value products segments and improve our competitiveness and profitability across the entire portfolio, and we're making good progress with our business model transformation in RBIS. 
So starting with Pressure-sensitive Materials. As you know, our goal in PSM has been to create value by organically growing the top line of this high-return business at 4% to 5% while expanding operating margins. And I'm pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. In the second quarter, we grew PSM sales by nearly 5% on an organic basis and expanded adjusted operating margins to a new high of 13.5%. Once again, emerging markets were a key growth driver, up 10% in the quarter. 
From a product perspective, high-value graphics and specialty labels materials continue to grow at rates well above the segment average, while sales declined for Performance Tapes due largely to the loss of a specific customer application, as we've discussed before. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher-value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas, including acquisitions exemplified by the Mactac deal that we announced in April. 
As for the base business within PSM, what we have often referred to as less differentiated products, we continue to deliver in the second quarter, with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across the board. Speaking of which, overall profitability for PSM exceeded our expectations, reflecting leverage on strong volume growth; continued disciplined with respect to pricing in the base business; and of course, exceptional execution on the productivity front. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically, driven by Radio Frequency Identification. I'm happy to report that RFID sales were up nearly 50% in Q2. The case for RFID is clear, and we remain the go-to supplier in the market, so expect it to continue to be a key growth driver market for us going forward. 
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst the challenging apparel market, in particular, continued challenges experienced by the department stores and inventory reductions associated with athletic goods store closures. That said, we are seeing signs of success from our multiyear transformation strategy, becoming faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion. Specifically, we saw solid volume gains in both the value and fast fashion segments of the market during Q2. And unit volume for the department stores were relatively stable, an improvement over recent trends. 
We are also on track to deliver planned restructuring savings from the transformation. With these actions we're taking to improve our competitiveness in the base business, along with the lift from RFID, even in a relatively modest apparel retail market, I am confident we will achieve our 2018 margin target for RBIS. 
Now looking at Vancive Medical Technologies. While this business reported solid margin expansion in the quarter, we're not yet performing at the level we expect. We began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill our product pipeline and have recently reestablished the organizational link between our Vancive and Performance Tapes business. Long term, these actions, combined with strong growth from our new product platform, should enable us to deliver consistent organic growth and double-digit margins in this business. 
So coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, reflecting the strong results we delivered in the second quarter. Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies: First and foremost being our focus on driving outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments. 
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, drive margin expansion. 
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth. And of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

I'll be providing a little more color on the quarter. In Q2, we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth.

In Q2, we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the second quarter with an approximately $0.03 impact to EPS. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter improved 120 basis points to 10.7%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs and higher employee-related expenses. 
We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $152 million, an increase of $38 million compared to last year, reflecting the increase in earnings and timing of tax payments. 
During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares and paid $70 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 1.2 million for a net cost of $119 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $190 million. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund acquisitions as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 5% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth for this segment. With organic growth of 10%, emerging markets represented a majority of the segment's top line growth in Q2, in line with the preceding quarter and our long-term expectations. A key exception to this strong growth trend has been China, where sales were roughly flat in the quarter on an organic basis. 
In North America, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, while Western Europe remains solid, up mid-single digits. 
As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth in many of PSM's high-value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, specialty film and paper products were up 10% on an organic basis, and graphics grew high single digits. In contrast, sales of Performance Tapes were down mid-single digits on an organic basis for the reasons we've discussed. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin of 13.5% was up 120 basis points over the last year, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of price and raw material input costs. By the way, that net gap between deflation and pricing was a modest negative for the quarter. We wanted to highlight it, given the change in direction from preceding quarters. 
Once again, the team delivered the majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity efforts, including product re-engineering and restructuring. 
Now shifting to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis, driven by growth of Radio Frequency Identification products, which were up nearly 50% in the quarter. We now anticipate full year sales for these products to be up more than 30% in 2016, recognizing that the comps get significantly more challenging in the second half. 
Adjusting for the impact of RFID, organic growth for core labels and tags was down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began to take late last year. As you know, we began lowering our prices in some categories late in 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons become easier in the work quarter. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong unit volume growth for 
[Audio Gap]
European retailers and brand owners. This reflects excellent progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players. In contrast, unit volumes declined in the U.S., where we have a relatively high share position among department stores. Notwithstanding the modest volume growth and pricing adjustments we've made, adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 30 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the restructuring and other cost-reduction actions we've taken to transform our business model. We remain on track to achieve our margin target for this business by 2018. 
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the range of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 to $3.80 to $3.95. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material. Highlighting the changes from our previous guidance, we now expect that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2.5% and pretax earnings by roughly $18 million or an estimated $0.13 per share, $0.02 worse than our April guidance. 
We have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 4% on an organic basis. We anticipate that the Mactac deal will close in August, resulting in roughly a point of incremental sale with an immaterial impact to EPS this year, reflecting various transition costs. We have reduced our estimate for severance and other restructuring-related costs included in reported EPS by approximately $0.05. 
So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocations of capital. 
And now we'll open the call up for your questions."

So just talking about the emerging markets, so China was relatively flat, as Anne commented on. Everything else saw pretty exceptional growth. If you look at Southeast Asia, that was very healthy double digits as was India. And Eastern Europe returned to good growth trajectory as well. Some of that, we think, is a little bit of pipeline fill within in the quarter. But even if you back that out, we've turned to a healthy growth level. And Latin America, we continue to see solid growth. A lot of that comes from pricing, as you know. But even on the volume front, we saw a return to growth, particularly in Brazil. Now some of that has to do with the elections that come up. They always have a benefit for us. And not sure what the impact is specifically from the Olympics, but we assume that, that has some positive lift as well. So pretty broad-based on the emerging market exposure. And you're seeing a little bit of shift. If you look at the last number of years, China was the lead driver of the emerging market growth, and we're starting to see that our strategy of being the leader in all markets is paying off with -- as China starts to slow down the rest of the emerging market is carrying the load.

The other one, which doesn't reduce that exposure to apparel but does create a growth driver for us, is the external embellishment, so the heat transfer labels. This business, if you look 10 years ago, was only about the heat transfer labels on the interior of the garment. We are going to the exterior of the garment, where it's actually part of the branding that is displayed, whether it be for brands or sports teams and so forth.

There are lots of things that are going right for Pressure-sensitive at the moment, the growth in emerging markets, the mix inherent in those markets and so on. And those -- I recognize seasonally there should be some drop-off, but we wouldn't expect a significant one in the third quarter, anyway, relative to second quarter based on history.

I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. We continue to drive",774,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. I'm happy to report another quarter with strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We beat our expectations for Q2 adjusted EPS by about $0.05, driven by another exceptional quarter in PSM. 
We continue to drive above-average growth in high-value products segments and improve our competitiveness and profitability across the entire portfolio, and we're making good progress with our business model transformation in RBIS. 
So starting with Pressure-sensitive Materials. As you know, our goal in PSM has been to create value by organically growing the top line of this high-return business at 4% to 5% while expanding operating margins. And I'm pleased to say that the team continues to deliver on both fronts. In the second quarter, we grew PSM sales by nearly 5% on an organic basis and expanded adjusted operating margins to a new high of 13.5%. Once again, emerging markets were a key growth driver, up 10% in the quarter. 
From a product perspective, high-value graphics and specialty labels materials continue to grow at rates well above the segment average, while sales declined for Performance Tapes due largely to the loss of a specific customer application, as we've discussed before. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher-value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas, including acquisitions exemplified by the Mactac deal that we announced in April. 
As for the base business within PSM, what we have often referred to as less differentiated products, we continue to deliver in the second quarter, with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across the board. Speaking of which, overall profitability for PSM exceeded our expectations, reflecting leverage on strong volume growth; continued disciplined with respect to pricing in the base business; and of course, exceptional execution on the productivity front. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically, driven by Radio Frequency Identification. I'm happy to report that RFID sales were up nearly 50% in Q2. The case for RFID is clear, and we remain the go-to supplier in the market, so expect it to continue to be a key growth driver market for us going forward. 
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst the challenging apparel market, in particular, continued challenges experienced by the department stores and inventory reductions associated with athletic goods store closures. That said, we are seeing signs of success from our multiyear transformation strategy, becoming faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion. Specifically, we saw solid volume gains in both the value and fast fashion segments of the market during Q2. And unit volume for the department stores were relatively stable, an improvement over recent trends. 
We are also on track to deliver planned restructuring savings from the transformation. With these actions we're taking to improve our competitiveness in the base business, along with the lift from RFID, even in a relatively modest apparel retail market, I am confident we will achieve our 2018 margin target for RBIS. 
Now looking at Vancive Medical Technologies. While this business reported solid margin expansion in the quarter, we're not yet performing at the level we expect. We began taking actions mid-last year that are beginning to refill our product pipeline and have recently reestablished the organizational link between our Vancive and Performance Tapes business. Long term, these actions, combined with strong growth from our new product platform, should enable us to deliver consistent organic growth and double-digit margins in this business. 
So coming back to the total company view. In terms of our outlook for 2016, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, reflecting the strong results we delivered in the second quarter. Even more important, we remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies: First and foremost being our focus on driving outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here, both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments. 
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, drive margin expansion. 
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth. And of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Anne."

In Q2, we delivered a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 4% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the second quarter with an approximately $0.03 impact to EPS. 
Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter improved 120 basis points to 10.7%, as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs and higher employee-related expenses. 
We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate was 34%, consistent with the anticipated full year tax rate in the low to mid-30% range. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $152 million, an increase of $38 million compared to last year, reflecting the increase in earnings and timing of tax payments. 
During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares and paid $70 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by 1.2 million for a net cost of $119 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $190 million. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to fund acquisitions as well as to continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 5% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth for this segment. With organic growth of 10%, emerging markets represented a majority of the segment's top line growth in Q2, in line with the preceding quarter and our long-term expectations. A key exception to this strong growth trend has been China, where sales were roughly flat in the quarter on an organic basis. 
In North America, sales declined modestly on an organic basis, while Western Europe remains solid, up mid-single digits. 
As noted previously, we continue to see strong growth in many of PSM's high-value segments. Within Label and Packaging Materials, specialty film and paper products were up 10% on an organic basis, and graphics grew high single digits. In contrast, sales of Performance Tapes were down mid-single digits on an organic basis for the reasons we've discussed. 
PSM's adjusted operating margin of 13.5% was up 120 basis points over the last year, as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of price and raw material input costs. By the way, that net gap between deflation and pricing was a modest negative for the quarter. We wanted to highlight it, given the change in direction from preceding quarters. 
Once again, the team delivered the majority of this quarter's margin improvement through ongoing productivity efforts, including product re-engineering and restructuring. 
Now shifting to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis, driven by growth of Radio Frequency Identification products, which were up nearly 50% in the quarter. We now anticipate full year sales for these products to be up more than 30% in 2016, recognizing that the comps get significantly more challenging in the second half. 
Adjusting for the impact of RFID, organic growth for core labels and tags was down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began to take late last year. As you know, we began lowering our prices in some categories late in 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons become easier in the work quarter. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong unit volume growth for 
[Audio Gap]
European retailers and brand owners. This reflects excellent progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players. In contrast, unit volumes declined in the U.S., where we have a relatively high share position among department stores. Notwithstanding the modest volume growth and pricing adjustments we've made, adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 30 basis points, reflecting the benefit of the restructuring and other cost-reduction actions we've taken to transform our business model. We remain on track to achieve our margin target for this business by 2018. 
Turning now to our outlook for the balance of the year. We have raised the range of our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 to $3.80 to $3.95. We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material. Highlighting the changes from our previous guidance, we now expect that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 2.5% and pretax earnings by roughly $18 million or an estimated $0.13 per share, $0.02 worse than our April guidance. 
We have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 4% on an organic basis. We anticipate that the Mactac deal will close in August, resulting in roughly a point of incremental sale with an immaterial impact to EPS this year, reflecting various transition costs. We have reduced our estimate for severance and other restructuring-related costs included in reported EPS by approximately $0.05. 
So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. I'm confident we will continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocations of capital. 
And now we'll open the call up for your questions."

So just talking about the emerging markets, so China was relatively flat, as Anne commented on. Everything else saw pretty exceptional growth. If you look at Southeast Asia, that was very healthy double digits as was India. And Eastern Europe returned to good growth trajectory as well. Some of that, we think, is a little bit of pipeline fill within in the quarter. But even if you back that out, we've turned to a healthy growth level. And Latin America, we continue to see solid growth. A lot of that comes from pricing, as you know. But even on the volume front, we saw a return to growth, particularly in Brazil. Now some of that has to do with the elections that come up. They always have a benefit for us. And not sure what the impact is specifically from the Olympics, but we assume that, that has some positive lift as well. So pretty broad-based on the emerging market exposure. And you're seeing a little bit of shift. If you look at the last number of years, China was the lead driver of the emerging market growth, and we're starting to see that our strategy of being the leader in all markets is paying off with -- as China starts to slow down the rest of the emerging market is carrying the load. And then North America, we said it was down modestly."

The other one, which doesn't reduce that exposure to apparel but does create a growth driver for us, is the external embellishment, so the heat transfer labels.

We are going to the exterior of the garment, where it's actually part of the branding that is displayed, whether it be for brands or sports teams and so forth.

I will tell you, when I was over there speaking with customers, generally, they're talking about the challenge of just a little bit low -- adjusting to a lower growth environment right now. We do expect this business to continue to grow and China to be a mid-single-digit growth market, which we still consider a very healthy clip. And so you're seeing a little bit of adjustments down from, I'd say, that industry used to growth closer to 10% and being mid-single digits. Specifically, within the quarter, there was a number of puts and takes for being depressed down to the low single digits or roughly flat, but no key takeaways right now. And I will say, for our business, a single quarter of being flat to growing a few percent, that can happen. Our expectation here is mid-single digits for China."

As we think about the guidance for the year, and it went up $0.05, which was basically what the variance was, round numbers, in the second quarter, which in turn was driven by Pressure-sensitive Materials.

There are lots of things that are going right for Pressure-sensitive at the moment, the growth in emerging markets, the mix inherent in those markets and so on. And those -- I recognize seasonally there should be some drop-off, but we wouldn't expect a significant one in the third quarter, anyway, relative to second quarter based on history. So should we just very simply assume that the only -- the reason you only took your guidance up by the amount that you beat 2Q is that whatever you're seeing in improvement in Pressure-sensitive is being largely offset at this juncture by RBIS and Vancive at the back half of the year?

We had another quarter of strong earnings growth with EPS above our expectations.
We are improving our competitiveness with continued strong profitability across the PSM portfolio and making progress with our business model transformation in RBIS.
As expected, organic sales growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials moderated in the third quarter to 3%, reflecting the program loss in the personal care segment of Performance Tapes that we've discussed previously. Excluding this program loss, sales grew 4.5% organically.
Once again, emerging markets were the key growth driver for PSM, more than offsetting softness in the North American market. From a product perspective, the base label materials business remained healthy with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across most categories. Graphics and specialty label materials were up high single-digits for the quarter on a global basis. I'm pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas. Speaking of which, the integration of our acquisition of the Mactac graphics and tapes business, which we completed in August is going smoothly. We also completed a very small acquisition of Ink Mill during the quarter, which expands our capabilities in the high-value reflectives business. And earlier this month, we made an equity investment in the U.K.-based startup called PragmatIC, leveraging our strength in RFID to enable long-term growth of intelligent labels in new segments. 
All 3 of these recent deals exemplify the range of opportunities we have identified and continue to pursue within our M&A pipeline, with a focus on high-value product lines and supporting technologies.
Our commitment to investing here in terms of both M&A and higher capital spending is reinforced by the excellent progress we've made with the high-value segments through which we have delivered consistent organic growth, improved mix and strong profitability and returns.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically driven by Radio Frequency Identification. RFID sales were up over 35% in Q3 and are expected to exceed 30% for the full year. While the pace of growth was slow in the fourth quarter, reflecting the difficult comparison the prior year that we've discussed, we expect the RFID will continue to be a key growth driver for us.
We are continuing to invest in this high-value product line, expanding capacity and improving our manufacturing processes as well as participating in promising new ventures like PragmatIC.
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst a difficult retail apparel market in the U.S. particularly among the department stores.
That said, we saw solid volume gains across the base business, representing clear signs of success for our multiyear transformation strategy as we become faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion.
Our strategy is the right one. Moving decision-making closer to our markets, reducing complexity as well as our cost structure and qualifying lower-cost, locally sourced materials to support more competitive pricing.
Our improvements in service, flexibility and speed are resonating with customers. In light of the soft top line though, these actions have not been enough to deliver the margin expansion we had targeted for the year. Now we will accelerate our efforts through 2017 to further improve our competitiveness and achieve our 2018 margin expansion target.
So coming back to the total company view. Overall, we've made good progress against our strategic and financial objectives as evidenced by another solid quarter and a $0.10 increase to expected EPS for the year.
We remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. First and foremost, we will drive outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions.  Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments.
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, to drive margin expansion.
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Anne."

In Q3, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the third quarter, which was offset by the lift from the Mactac acquisition.
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter improved 40 basis points to 9.8% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the net impact of price and raw material input cost. We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31%, reflecting a reduction to our estimate for the full year effective tax rate from 34% at the end of Q2 to 33% due to stronger income growth and lower tax jurisdictions.
Year-to-date, free cash flow was $248 million, an increase of $57 million compared to last year. During the first 9 months of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares and paid $106 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by approximately 1 million shares for a net cost of $118 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $224 million. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we have ample capacity to continue funding acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
We funded the acquisition of Mactac Europe through euro-denominated commercial paper. We will explore a euro-denominated debt offering in the first half of next year to refinance notes that will be maturing later in 2017 as well as the Mactac acquisition. Our objective will be to take advantage of the low interest rates in Europe and the opportunity to hedge currency exposure on our balance sheet. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 3% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth through the segment, representing virtually all of the top line growth in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the program loss in Performance Tapes, emerging market sales were up over 10% organically comparable to the pace we saw in the second quarter. This strength was fairly widespread across the countries that comprise emerging markets. Of particular note, the underlying growth trend in China picked up modestly compared to the second quarter. You may recall that sales in China were roughly flat in Q2 on an organic basis. Adjusting for holiday timing and the tapes loss, we estimate the underlying organic sales growth for China was back to the low single digit rate we saw in the first quarter of this year and for 2015 as a whole. 
Turning to the mature markets. In North America, sales declined at a low single-digit rate on an organic basis. This reflects a soft market and the pass-through of savings from deflation, while Western Europe was up low single-digits. Demand in Western Europe has been consistently growing at solid low- to mid-single digit rates and on occasion even higher.  Factoring in Eastern Europe, the overall European market has been a strong source of growth for us and we expect that strength to continue.
We are investing to keep pace with the growth in this region, recently announcing a $65 million investment over the next 1.5 years to expand both the capabilities and capacity of our flagship operation in Luxembourg. From a product line perspective, Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, while sales for the combined Graphics and Performance Tapes product lines were down low single-digits reflecting the expected program loss for tapes.
Excluding the program loss, combined sales for Graphics and Performance Tapes were up mid-single digits on an organic basis.
Pressure-sensitive Materials adjusted operating margin of 12.6% was up 50 basis points over last year as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input cost as well as unfavorable mix. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis driven by growth of RFID.  Sales outside of RFID continue to be soft down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began taking late last year.
As you know, we began adjusting our prices in late 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons for the base business become modestly easier in the fourth quarter. As Mitch said, we do believe that the transformation of our business model becoming more cost and price competitive while providing better and faster service is driving volume growth albeit in a challenging retail apparel environment that makes it tough to see the impact of these wins in our financial results.
From a regional perspective, we saw strong mid-single-digit unit point growth for core Label products among European retailers and brand owners due in part to continued progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players.
Unit volumes for core products were flat in the U.S, an improvement over the mid-single-digit decline we saw last quarter. This market is especially challenged as demonstrated by macro indicators.  In particular, apparel imports into the U.S. were down on average by about 3% for the most recent 3 months reported. And since the fourth quarter of last year, the inventory to sales ratio for U.S. apparel has been at prerecession level. Adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 20 basis points as the net savings from the business model transformation was largely offset by higher employee-related costs. We have not changed our long-term margin expansion objectives for this business and expect to achieve the goal we set for 2018.
As expected, sales for Vancive Medical Technologies were down 20% on an organic basis in the quarter, reflecting the combined effect of share losses and customer inventory reductions. We were able to partially offset the impact of the sales loss through cost-reduction actions.  Going forward, the steps we began taking mid last year should enable consistent growth and significant margin expansion over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We have raised the midpoint of the range of our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to $3.95 to $4. This reflects the better-than-expected operating results that we delivered in the third quarter, including the lower expected tax rate.
We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material.
Highlighting the changes from our previous expectations, we have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 3.5% on an organic basis.
We now expect more than $75 million from restructuring savings net of transition cost for the year. And as discussed previously, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 33%.
So just wrapping up, we're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. We're confident we can continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital. Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

But in the quarter, we think this -- it basically softened a bit. We don't have clear reasons why. At Labelexpo, the sentiment from North American converters was overall I'd say, most of them were very confident in their individual businesses, cautious about the market overall. But also talked about how they themselves, have less visibility to their own order volumes than they traditionally have had as well. So it's hard to give you a read on exactly what's going on in the North American business. Clearly, some of the decline was from Graphics, if you will, within that region specifically.

But generally, I think it's relatively broad-based in the data that Anne shared is across the entire retail apparel sector, if you will. So inventory levels, return to back this year to their prerecession high. If you recall for a few years after the recession, they were quite a bit lower. Those have balked up. A good portion of that relates to the fact that it was a very warm winter last year and just there was not as much as sell-through as we have been holding on the inventory. So I know the goals for retailers to flush them inventory out of the system through this holiday season. And then for Europe, it depends are overall also softness in the U.K. Clearly, the U.K. retailers with Brexit going on, I think, are struggling a bit. So that's 1 place we see softness. But in Germany, pretty solid. Other markets, we're seeing relatively solid performance at the end retail level."

So I think, overall, what makes us confident around that is the adjustments that we made -- started making last year, that we talk through at the beginning of what we said would be a multiyear transportation. We made quite a few adjustments, and a lot of that was around moving more decision-making into that regions and closer to the customer, having a more segment approach depending different customers if ever full athletic performance athletic brand relative to a discounted retailer, they have different needs so we of adopt a more segmented approach. And as part of that, in some of the segments, that meant adjusting our cost structure to 1, expand margin led to come also to get more price competitive. Remember that the variable margin in this business even in what we call the less differentiated are relatively high. And so being able to drive consistent growth is a key requirement within this business as well. So -- what's what are the signs of success? It's based on welfare getting volume, of sure that we had for a couple of years going into mid last year. And we're seeing volume gains even though the market is down. And we basically proven the model ourselves internally so now it's a matter of pushing forward to accelerate. And as far as just to get to the margin target that we've laid out for 2018, if you recall, when we lay those out, we identified there is a lot amortization expense going away late in the cycle. So we've got to have basically the full point of expansion just from that. That's not new. We talk about it when we first laid out the targets. So that gives you a full point and then from there, primarily expect to be this year, you need less than a point of margin expansion over the 2 years to get to the low end and less than 2 points to get to the high end."

As expected, organic sales growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials moderated in the third quarter to 3%, reflecting the program loss in the personal care segment of Performance Tapes that we've discussed previously. Excluding this program loss, sales grew 4.5% organically.
Once again, emerging markets were the key growth driver for PSM, more than offsetting softness in the North American market. From a product perspective, the base label materials business remained healthy with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across most categories. Graphics and specialty label materials were up high single-digits for the quarter on a global basis. I'm pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas. Speaking of which, the integration of our acquisition of the Mactac graphics and tapes business, which we completed in August is going smoothly. We also completed a very small acquisition of Ink Mill during the quarter, which expands our capabilities in the high-value reflectives business. And earlier this month, we made an equity investment in the U.K.-based startup called PragmatIC, leveraging our strength in RFID to enable long-term growth of intelligent labels in new segments. 
All 3 of these recent deals exemplify the range of opportunities we have identified and continue to pursue within our M&A pipeline, with a focus on high-value product lines and supporting technologies.
Our commitment to investing here in terms of both M&A and higher capital spending is reinforced by the excellent progress we've made with the high-value segments through which we have delivered consistent organic growth, improved mix and strong profitability and returns.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically driven by Radio Frequency Identification. RFID sales were up over 35% in Q3 and are expected to exceed 30% for the full year. While the pace of growth was slow in the fourth quarter, reflecting the difficult comparison the prior year that we've discussed, we expect the RFID will continue to be a key growth driver for us.
We are continuing to invest in this high-value product line, expanding capacity and improving our manufacturing processes as well as participating in promising new ventures like PragmatIC.
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst a difficult retail apparel market in the U.S. particularly among the department stores.
That said, we saw solid volume gains across the base business, representing clear signs of success for our multiyear transformation strategy as we become faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion.
Our strategy is the right one. Moving decision-making closer to our markets, reducing complexity as well as our cost structure and qualifying lower-cost, locally sourced materials to support more competitive pricing.
Our improvements in service, flexibility and speed are resonating with customers. In light of the soft top line though, these actions have not been enough to deliver the margin expansion we had targeted for the year. Now we will accelerate our efforts through 2017 to further improve our competitiveness and achieve our 2018 margin expansion target.
So coming back to the total company view. Overall, we've made good progress against our strategic and financial objectives as evidenced by another solid quarter and a $0.10 increase to expected EPS for the year.
We remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. First and foremost, we will drive outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments.
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, to drive margin expansion.
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Anne."

In Q3, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the third quarter, which was offset by the lift from the Mactac acquisition.
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter improved 40 basis points to 9.8% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the net impact of price and raw material input cost. We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31%, reflecting a reduction to our estimate for the full year effective tax rate from 34% at the end of Q2 to 33% due to stronger income growth and lower tax jurisdictions.
Year-to-date, free cash flow was $248 million, an increase of $57 million compared to last year. During the first 9 months of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares and paid $106 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by approximately 1 million shares for a net cost of $118 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $224 million. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we have ample capacity to continue funding acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
We funded the acquisition of Mactac Europe through euro-denominated commercial paper. We will explore a euro-denominated debt offering in the first half of next year to refinance notes that will be maturing later in 2017 as well as the Mactac acquisition. Our objective will be to take advantage of the low interest rates in Europe and the opportunity to hedge currency exposure on our balance sheet. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 3% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth through the segment, representing virtually all of the top line growth in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the program loss in Performance Tapes, emerging market sales were up over 10% organically comparable to the pace we saw in the second quarter. This strength was fairly widespread across the countries that comprise emerging markets. Of particular note, the underlying growth trend in China picked up modestly compared to the second quarter. You may recall that sales in China were roughly flat in Q2 on an organic basis. Adjusting for holiday timing and the tapes loss, we estimate the underlying organic sales growth for China was back to the low single digit rate we saw in the first quarter of this year and for 2015 as a whole. 
Turning to the mature markets. In North America, sales declined at a low single-digit rate on an organic basis. This reflects a soft market and the pass-through of savings from deflation, while Western Europe was up low single-digits. Demand in Western Europe has been consistently growing at solid low- to mid-single digit rates and on occasion even higher. Factoring in Eastern Europe, the overall European market has been a strong source of growth for us and we expect that strength to continue.
We are investing to keep pace with the growth in this region, recently announcing a $65 million investment over the next 1.5 years to expand both the capabilities and capacity of our flagship operation in Luxembourg. From a product line perspective, Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, while sales for the combined Graphics and Performance Tapes product lines were down low single-digits reflecting the expected program loss for tapes.
Excluding the program loss, combined sales for Graphics and Performance Tapes were up mid-single digits on an organic basis.
Pressure-sensitive Materials adjusted operating margin of 12.6% was up 50 basis points over last year as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input cost as well as unfavorable mix. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis driven by growth of RFID. Sales outside of RFID continue to be soft down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began taking late last year.
As you know, we began adjusting our prices in late 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons for the base business become modestly easier in the fourth quarter. As Mitch said, we do believe that the transformation of our business model becoming more cost and price competitive while providing better and faster service is driving volume growth albeit in a challenging retail apparel environment that makes it tough to see the impact of these wins in our financial results.
From a regional perspective, we saw strong mid-single-digit unit point growth for core Label products among European retailers and brand owners due in part to continued progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players.
Unit volumes for core products were flat in the U.S, an improvement over the mid-single-digit decline we saw last quarter. This market is especially challenged as demonstrated by macro indicators. In particular, apparel imports into the U.S. were down on average by about 3% for the most recent 3 months reported. And since the fourth quarter of last year, the inventory to sales ratio for U.S. apparel has been at prerecession level. Adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 20 basis points as the net savings from the business model transformation was largely offset by higher employee-related costs. We have not changed our long-term margin expansion objectives for this business and expect to achieve the goal we set for 2018.
As expected, sales for Vancive Medical Technologies were down 20% on an organic basis in the quarter, reflecting the combined effect of share losses and customer inventory reductions. We were able to partially offset the impact of the sales loss through cost-reduction actions. Going forward, the steps we began taking mid last year should enable consistent growth and significant margin expansion over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We have raised the midpoint of the range of our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to $3.95 to $4. This reflects the better-than-expected operating results that we delivered in the third quarter, including the lower expected tax rate.
We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation material.
Highlighting the changes from our previous expectations, we have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 3.5% on an organic basis.
We now expect more than $75 million from restructuring savings net of transition cost for the year. And as discussed previously, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 33%.
So just wrapping up. We're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. We're confident we can continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital. Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

But in the quarter, we think this -- it basically softened a bit. We don't have clear reasons why. At Labelexpo, the sentiment from North American converters was overall I'd say, most of them were very confident in their individual businesses, cautious about the market overall. But also talked about how they themselves, have less visibility to their own order volumes than they traditionally have had as well. So it's hard to give you a read on exactly what's going on in the North American business. Clearly, some of the decline was from Graphics, if you will, within that region specifically.

So inventory levels, return to back this year to their prerecession high. If you recall for a few years after recession, they were quite a bit lower. Those have bulked up. A good portion of that relates to the fact that it was a very warm winter last year and just there was not as much as sell-through as we've been holding on in the inventory. So I know the goal is for retailers to flush some of their inventory out of the system through this holiday season. And then for Europe, it depends. Overall, we also softness in the U.K. Clearly, the U.K. retailers with Brexit going on, I think, are struggling a bit. And so that's one place we see softness. But in Germany, pretty solid.

So I think, overall, what makes us confident around that is the adjustments that we made -- started making last year, that we talk through and it was the beginning of what we said would be a multiyear transformation. We made quite a few adjustments,",342,"Yes. So I think, overall, what makes us confident around that is the adjustments that we made -- started making last year, that we talk through and it was the beginning of what we said would be a multiyear transformation. We made quite a few adjustments, and a lot of that was around moving more decision-making into the regions and closer to the customer, having a more segmented approach depending -- different customers if it's a performance athletic, high-end performance athletic brand relative to a discounted retailer, they have different needs so we've adopted a more segmented approach. And as part of that, in some of the -- in some segments, that meant adjusting our cost structure to: one, expand margin; but two, also to get more price competitive. Remember that the variable margin in this business even in what we call the less differentiated are relatively high. And so being able to drive consistent growth is a key requirement within this business as well. So -- what's -- what are the signs of success? It's basically we're getting volume gains. We've stopped the share slide that we had for a couple of years going into mid last year. And we're seeing volume gains even though the market is down. And we've basically proven the model ourselves internally so now it's a matter of pushing forward to accelerate. And as far as just to get to the margin target that we've laid out for 2018, if you recall, when we laid those out, we identified, there's a lot amortization expense going away late in the cycle. So we got to have basically the full point of expansion just from that. That's not new. We talked about it when we first laid out the targets. So that gives you a full point. And then from there, from where we expect to be this year, you need less than a point of margin expansion over 2 years to get to the low end and less than 2 points to get to the high end."

We had another quarter of strong earnings growth with EPS above our expectations. We are improving our competitiveness with continued strong profitability across the PSM portfolio and making progress with our busines",733,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. We had another quarter of strong earnings growth with EPS above our expectations. We are improving our competitiveness with continued strong profitability across the PSM portfolio and making progress with our business model transformation in RBIS.
As expected, organic sales growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials moderated in the third quarter to 3%, reflecting the program loss in the personal care segment of Performance Tapes that we've discussed previously. Excluding this program loss, sales grew 4.5% organically.
Once again, emerging markets were the key growth driver for PSM, more than offsetting softness in the North American market. From a product perspective, the base label materials business remained healthy with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across most categories. Graphics and specialty label materials were up high single-digits for the quarter on a global basis. I'm pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas. 
Speaking of which, the integration of our acquisition of the Mactac graphics and tapes business, which we completed in August, is going smoothly. We also completed a very small acquisition of Ink Mill during the quarter, which expands our capabilities in the high-value reflectives business. And earlier this month, we made an equity investment in the U.K.-based startup called PragmatIC, leveraging our strength in RFID to enable long-term growth of intelligent labels in new segments. 
All 3 of these recent deals exemplify the range of opportunities we have identified and continue to pursue within our M&A pipeline, with a focus on high-value product lines and supporting technologies.
Our commitment to investing here in terms of both M&A and higher capital spending is reinforced by the excellent progress we've made with the high-value segments through which we have delivered consistent organic growth, improved mix and strong profitability and returns.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically driven by Radio Frequency Identification. RFID sales were up over 35% in Q3 and are expected to exceed 30% for the full year. While the pace of growth was slow in the fourth quarter, reflecting the difficult comparison to prior year that we've discussed, we expect that RFID will continue to be a key growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in this high-value product line, expanding capacity and improving our manufacturing processes as well as participating in promising new ventures like PragmatIC.
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst a difficult retail apparel market in the U.S. particularly among the department stores. That said, we saw solid volume gains across the base business, representing clear signs of success for our multiyear transformation strategy as we become faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion.
Our strategy is the right one. Moving decision-making closer to our markets, reducing complexity as well as our cost structure and qualifying lower-cost, locally sourced materials to support more competitive pricing. Our improvements in service, flexibility and speed are resonating with customers. In light of the soft top line though, these actions have not been enough to deliver the margin expansion we had targeted for the year. Now we will accelerate our efforts through 2017 to further improve our competitiveness and achieve our 2018 margin expansion target.
So coming back to the total company view. Overall, we've made good progress against our strategic and financial objectives as evidenced by another solid quarter and a $0.10 increase to expected EPS for the year. We remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. First and foremost, we will drive outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments.
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, to drive margin expansion.
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Anne."

In Q3, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the third quarter, which was offset by the lift from the Mactac acquisition.
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter improved 40 basis points to 9.8% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the net impact of price and raw material input cost. We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31%, reflecting a reduction to our estimate for the full year effective tax rate from 34% at the end of Q2 to 33% due to stronger income growth and lower tax jurisdictions.
Year-to-date, free cash flow was $248 million, an increase of $57 million compared to last year. During the first 9 months of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares and paid $106 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by approximately 1 million shares for a net cost of $118 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $224 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to continue funding acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
We funded the acquisition of Mactac Europe through euro-denominated commercial paper. We will explore a euro-denominated debt offering in the first half of next year to refinance notes that will be maturing later in 2017 as well as the Mactac acquisition. Our objective will be to take advantage of the low interest rates in Europe and the opportunity to hedge currency exposure on our balance sheet. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 3% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth through the segment, representing virtually all of its top line growth in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the program loss in Performance Tapes, emerging market sales were up over 10% organically comparable to the pace we saw in the second quarter. This strength was fairly widespread across the countries that comprise emerging markets. Of particular note, the underlying growth trend in China picked up modestly compared to the second quarter. You may recall that sales in China were roughly flat in Q2 on an organic basis. Adjusting for holiday timing and the tapes loss, we estimate the underlying organic sales growth for China was back to the low single digit rate we saw in the first quarter of this year and for 2015 as a whole. 
Turning to the mature markets. In North America, sales declined at a low single-digit rate on an organic basis. This reflects a soft market and the pass-through of savings from deflation, while Western Europe was up low single-digits. Demand in Western Europe has been consistently growing at solid low- to mid-single digit rates and on occasion even higher. Factoring in Eastern Europe, the overall European market has been a strong source of growth for us and we expect that strength to continue.
We are investing to keep pace with the growth in this region, recently announcing a $65 million investment over the next 1.5 years to expand both the capabilities and capacity of our flagship operation in Luxembourg. From a product line perspective, Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, while sales for the combined Graphics and Performance Tapes product lines were down low single-digits reflecting the expected program loss for tapes.
Excluding the program loss, combined sales for Graphics and Performance Tapes were up mid-single digits on an organic basis.
Pressure-sensitive Materials adjusted operating margin of 12.6% was up 50 basis points over last year as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs as well as unfavorable mix. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis driven by growth of RFID. Sales outside of RFID continue to be soft down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began taking late last year.
As you know, we began adjusting our prices in late 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons for the base business become modestly easier in the fourth quarter. As Mitch said, we do believe that the transformation of our business model becoming more cost and price competitive while providing better and faster service is driving volume growth albeit in a challenging retail apparel environment that makes it tough to see the impact of these wins in our financial results.
From a regional perspective, we saw strong mid-single-digit unit volume growth for core Label products among European retailers and brand owners due in part to continued progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players.
Unit volumes for core products were flat in the U.S, an improvement over the mid-single-digit decline we saw last quarter. This market is especially challenged as demonstrated by macro indicators. In particular, apparel imports into the U.S. were down on average by about 3% for the most recent 3 months reported. And since the fourth quarter of last year, the inventory to sales ratio for U.S. apparel has been at prerecession levels. Adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 20 basis points as the net savings from the business model transformation were largely offset by higher employee-related costs. We have not changed our long-term margin expansion objectives for this business and expect to achieve the goal we set for 2018.
As expected, sales for Vancive Medical Technologies were down 20% on an organic basis in the quarter, reflecting the combined effect of share losses and customer inventory reductions. We were able to partially offset the impact of the sales loss through cost-reduction actions. Going forward, the steps we began taking mid last year should enable consistent growth and significant margin expansion over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We have raised the midpoint of the range of our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to $3.95 to $4. This reflects the better-than-expected operating results that we delivered in the third quarter, including the lower expected tax rate.
We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials.
Highlighting the changes from our previous expectations, we have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 3.5% on an organic basis.
We now expect more than $75 million from restructuring savings net of transition costs for the year. And as discussed previously, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 33%.
So just wrapping up. We're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. We're confident we can continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital. Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

We think there's been a softening in the end consumption of the market in Q3, but we don't have that data right now. But we also did cede some share earlier in the year within that business as we're driving more discipline on the lower value, less differentiated segments. But in the quarter, we think this -- it basically softened a bit. We don't have clear reasons why. At Labelexpo, the sentiment from North American converters was overall I'd say, most of them were very confident in their individual businesses, cautious about the market overall. But also talked about how they themselves, have less visibility to their own order volumes than they traditionally have had as well. So it's hard to give you a read on exactly what's going on in the North American business. Clearly, some of the decline was from Graphics, if you will, within that region specifically.

But generally, I think it's relatively broad-based in the data that Anne shared is across the entire retail apparel sector, if you will. So inventory levels returned to back this year to their prerecession high. If you recall for a few years after the recession, they were quite a bit lower. Those have bulked up. A good portion of that relates to the fact that it was a very warm winter last year and just there was not as much as sell-through as they've been holding onto the inventory. So I know the goal is for retailers to flush some of that inventory out of the system through this holiday season. And then for Europe, it depends. I'd say, overall, so softness in U.K. Clearly, the U.K. retailers with Brexit going on, I think, are struggling a bit. And so that's one place we see softness. But in Germany, pretty solid.

So I think, overall, what makes us confident around that is the adjustments that we made -- started making last year, that we talked through and it was the beginning of what we said would be a multiyear transformation. We made quite a few adjustments, and a lot of that was around moving more decision-making into the regions and closer to the customer, having a more segmented approach depending -- different customers if it's a performance athletic, high-end performance athletic brand relative to a discounted retailer, they have different needs so we've adopted a more segmented approach. And as part of that, in some of the -- in some segments, that meant adjusting our cost structure to: one, expand margin; but two, also to get more price competitive. Remember that the variable margins in this business, even in what we call the less differentiated, are relatively high. And so being able to drive consistent growth is a key requirement within this business as well. So -- what's -- what are the signs of success? It's basically we're getting volume gains. We've stopped the share slide that we had for a couple of years going into mid last year. And we're seeing volume gains even though the market is down. And we've basically proven the model ourselves internally so now it's a matter of pushing forward to accelerate. And as far as just to get to the margin target that we've laid out for 2018, if you recall, when we laid those out, we identified, there's a lot amortization expense going away late in the cycle. So we got to have basically the full point of expansion just from that. That's not new. We talked about it when we first laid out the targets. So that gives you a full point. And then from there, from where we expect to be this year, you need less than a point of margin expansion over 2 years to get to the low end and less than 2 points to get to the high end."

We had another quarter of strong earnings growth with EPS above our expectations. We are improving our competitiveness with continued strong profitability across the PSM portfolio and making progress with our busines",733,"Thanks, Cindy, and good day, everyone. We had another quarter of strong earnings growth with EPS above our expectations. We are improving our competitiveness with continued strong profitability across the PSM portfolio and making progress with our business model transformation in RBIS.
As expected, organic sales growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials moderated in the third quarter to 3%, reflecting the program loss in the personal care segment of Performance Tapes that we've discussed previously. Excluding this program loss, sales grew 4.5% organically.
Once again, emerging markets were the key growth driver for PSM, more than offsetting softness in the North American market. From a product perspective, the base label materials business remained healthy with solid top line growth overall and margins expanding across most categories. Graphics and specialty label materials were up high single-digits for the quarter on a global basis. I'm pleased with our progress in shifting PSM's portfolio mix towards these higher value categories. We expect continued benefit over the long term from our focus and investment in these areas. 
Speaking of which, the integration of our acquisition of the Mactac graphics and tapes business, which we completed in August, is going smoothly. We also completed a very small acquisition of Ink Mill during the quarter, which expands our capabilities in the high-value reflectives business. And earlier this month, we made an equity investment in the U.K.-based startup called PragmatIC, leveraging our strength in RFID to enable long-term growth of intelligent labels in new segments. 
All 3 of these recent deals exemplify the range of opportunities we have identified and continue to pursue within our M&A pipeline, with a focus on high-value product lines and supporting technologies.
Our commitment to investing here in terms of both M&A and higher capital spending is reinforced by the excellent progress we've made with the high-value segments through which we have delivered consistent organic growth, improved mix and strong profitability and returns.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. Sales were up a little over 2% organically driven by Radio Frequency Identification. RFID sales were up over 35% in Q3 and are expected to exceed 30% for the full year. While the pace of growth was slow in the fourth quarter, reflecting the difficult comparison to prior year that we've discussed, we expect that RFID will continue to be a key growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in this high-value product line, expanding capacity and improving our manufacturing processes as well as participating in promising new ventures like PragmatIC.
Outside of RFID, top line growth was short of our target for the quarter amidst a difficult retail apparel market in the U.S. particularly among the department stores. That said, we saw solid volume gains across the base business, representing clear signs of success for our multiyear transformation strategy as we become faster, simpler and more competitive while driving margin expansion.
Our strategy is the right one. Moving decision-making closer to our markets, reducing complexity as well as our cost structure and qualifying lower-cost, locally sourced materials to support more competitive pricing. Our improvements in service, flexibility and speed are resonating with customers. In light of the soft top line though, these actions have not been enough to deliver the margin expansion we had targeted for the year. Now we will accelerate our efforts through 2017 to further improve our competitiveness and achieve our 2018 margin expansion target.
So coming back to the total company view. Overall, we've made good progress against our strategic and financial objectives as evidenced by another solid quarter and a $0.10 increase to expected EPS for the year. We remain highly confident in our ability to consistently deliver exceptional value over the long run based on the execution of our key strategies. First and foremost, we will drive outsized growth in high-value segments. We will continue to invest disproportionately here both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. Over time, this will improve our portfolio mix and bolster our leadership in these key segments.
Second, we are relentless in our pursuit of productivity improvement to enhance our competitiveness across all product categories and, of course, to drive margin expansion.
And third, we are maintaining our high degree of capital efficiency while increasing investments to support profitable growth and, of course, we will continue our disciplined approach to returning cash to shareholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Anne."

In Q3, we delivered a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share on 3% organic sales growth. Currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.7% in the third quarter, which was offset by the lift from the Mactac acquisition.
Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter improved 40 basis points to 9.8% as the benefit of productivity initiatives and higher volume more than offset higher employee-related expenses and the net impact of price and raw material input cost. We realized about $21 million of incremental savings from restructuring charges net of transition costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 31%, reflecting a reduction to our estimate for the full year effective tax rate from 34% at the end of Q2 to 33% due to stronger income growth and lower tax jurisdictions.
Year-to-date, free cash flow was $248 million, an increase of $57 million compared to last year. During the first 9 months of the year, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares and paid $106 million in dividends. Net of dilution, we reduced our share count by approximately 1 million shares for a net cost of $118 million, bringing the total amount of cash returned to shareholders so far this year to roughly $224 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capacity to continue funding acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner.
We funded the acquisition of Mactac Europe through euro-denominated commercial paper. We will explore a euro-denominated debt offering in the first half of next year to refinance notes that will be maturing later in 2017 as well as the Mactac acquisition. Our objective will be to take advantage of the low interest rates in Europe and the opportunity to hedge currency exposure on our balance sheet. 
Now looking at the segments. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales were up approximately 3% on an organic basis. Emerging markets continue to be strong contributors to growth through the segment, representing virtually all of its top line growth in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the program loss in Performance Tapes, emerging market sales were up over 10% organically comparable to the pace we saw in the second quarter. This strength was fairly widespread across the countries that comprise emerging markets. Of particular note, the underlying growth trend in China picked up modestly compared to the second quarter. You may recall that sales in China were roughly flat in Q2 on an organic basis. Adjusting for holiday timing and the tapes loss, we estimate the underlying organic sales growth for China was back to the low single digit rate we saw in the first quarter of this year and for 2015 as a whole. 
Turning to the mature markets. In North America, sales declined at a low single-digit rate on an organic basis. This reflects a soft market and the pass-through of savings from deflation, while Western Europe was up low single-digits. Demand in Western Europe has been consistently growing at solid low- to mid-single digit rates and on occasion even higher. Factoring in Eastern Europe, the overall European market has been a strong source of growth for us and we expect that strength to continue.
We are investing to keep pace with the growth in this region, recently announcing a $65 million investment over the next 1.5 years to expand both the capabilities and capacity of our flagship operation in Luxembourg. From a product line perspective, Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, while sales for the combined Graphics and Performance Tapes product lines were down low single-digits reflecting the expected program loss for tapes.
Excluding the program loss, combined sales for Graphics and Performance Tapes were up mid-single digits on an organic basis.
Pressure-sensitive Materials adjusted operating margin of 12.6% was up 50 basis points over last year as the benefits from productivity and higher volume more than offset the net impact of price and raw material input costs as well as unfavorable mix. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales grew 2% on an organic basis driven by growth of RFID. Sales outside of RFID continue to be soft down low single digits, reflecting modest growth in volume, which was more than offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions that we began taking late last year.
As you know, we began adjusting our prices in late 2015 to become more competitive, so the sales growth comparisons for the base business become modestly easier in the fourth quarter. As Mitch said, we do believe that the transformation of our business model becoming more cost and price competitive while providing better and faster service is driving volume growth albeit in a challenging retail apparel environment that makes it tough to see the impact of these wins in our financial results.
From a regional perspective, we saw strong mid-single-digit unit volume growth for core Label products among European retailers and brand owners due in part to continued progress in expanding our share among the fast fashion players.
Unit volumes for core products were flat in the U.S, an improvement over the mid-single-digit decline we saw last quarter. This market is especially challenged as demonstrated by macro indicators. In particular, apparel imports into the U.S. were down on average by about 3% for the most recent 3 months reported. And since the fourth quarter of last year, the inventory to sales ratio for U.S. apparel has been at prerecession levels. Adjusted operating margin for the segment improved by 20 basis points as the net savings from the business model transformation were largely offset by higher employee-related costs. We have not changed our long-term margin expansion objectives for this business and expect to achieve the goal we set for 2018.
As expected, sales for Vancive Medical Technologies were down 20% on an organic basis in the quarter, reflecting the combined effect of share losses and customer inventory reductions. We were able to partially offset the impact of the sales loss through cost-reduction actions. Going forward, the steps we began taking mid last year should enable consistent growth and significant margin expansion over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We have raised the midpoint of the range of our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to $3.95 to $4. This reflects the better-than-expected operating results that we delivered in the third quarter, including the lower expected tax rate.
We outlined some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation materials.
Highlighting the changes from our previous expectations, we have reduced the high end of our organic growth outlook and now expect full year sales to grow between 3% and 3.5% on an organic basis.
We now expect more than $75 million from restructuring savings net of transition costs for the year. And as discussed previously, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 33%.
So just wrapping up. We're very pleased with the strategic and financial progress made against our 2018 goals this past quarter. We're confident we can continue to deliver exceptional value over the long term through superior execution of our strategies, including the disciplined allocation of capital. Now we'll open the call up for your questions."

But we also did cede some share earlier in the year within that business as we're driving more discipline on the lower value, less differentiated segments. But in the quarter, we think this -- it basically softened a bit. We don't have clear reasons why. At Labelexpo, the sentiment from North American converters was overall I'd say, most of them were very confident in their individual businesses, cautious about the market overall. But also talked about how they themselves, have less visibility to their own order volumes than they traditionally have had as well. So it's hard to give you a read on exactly what's going on in the North American business. Clearly, some of the decline was from Graphics, if you will, within that region specifically. But it's hard to give you a clear read here. As I said, first few weeks of October, we're starting to see an uptick."

But generally, I think it's relatively broad-based in the data that Anne shared is across the entire retail apparel sector, if you will. So inventory levels returned to back this year to their prerecession high. If you recall for a few years after the recession, they were quite a bit lower. Those have bulked up. A good portion of that relates to the fact that it was a very warm winter last year and just there was not as much as sell-through as they've been holding onto the inventory. So I know the goal is for retailers to flush some of that inventory out of the system through this holiday season. And then for Europe, it depends. I'd say, overall, so softness in U.K. Clearly, the U.K. retailers with Brexit going on, I think, are struggling a bit. And so that's one place we see softness. But in Germany, pretty solid. Other markets, we're seeing relatively solid performance at the end retail level."

So I think, overall, what makes us confident around that is the adjustments that we made -- started making last year, that we talked through and it was the beginning of what we said would be a multiyear transformation. We made quite a few adjustments, and a lot of that was around moving more decision-making into the regions and closer to the customer, having a more segmented approach depending -- different customers if it's a performance athletic, high-end performance athletic brand relative to a discounted retailer, they have different needs so we've adopted a more segmented approach. And as part of that, in some of the -- in some segments, that meant adjusting our cost structure to: one, expand margin; but two, also to get more price competitive. Remember that the variable margins in this business, even in what we call the less differentiated, are relatively high. And so being able to drive consistent growth is a key requirement within this business as well. So -- what's -- what are the signs of success? It's basically we're getting volume gains. We've stopped the share slide that we had for a couple of years going into mid last year. And we're seeing volume gains even though the market is down. And we've basically proven the model ourselves internally so now it's a matter of pushing forward to accelerate. And as far as just to get to the margin target that we've laid out for 2018, if you recall, when we laid those out, we identified, there's a lot amortization expense going away late in the cycle. So we got to have basically the full point of expansion just from that. That's not new. We talked about it when we first laid out the targets. So that gives you a full point. And then from there, from where we expect to be this year, you need less than a point of margin expansion over 2 years to get to the low end and less than 2 points to get to the high end."
