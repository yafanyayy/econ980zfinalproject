I am very excited to be conducting our first Willis Towers Watson earnings call. In fact, this call actually represents the union of 3 historic organizations: Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye. Gras",1123,"Thanks very much, Aida, and good morning, everyone. I am very excited to be conducting our first Willis Towers Watson earnings call. In fact, this call actually represents the union of 3 historic organizations: Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye. Gras Savoye, the leading insurance brokerage with a strong presence in Africa, the Middle East and part of Europe, became part of Willis on December 29, 2015. The merger of Willis and Towers Watson was completed as of January 4, 2016. 
We are now an organization of more than 39,000 colleagues serving more than in 120 countries, 90% of the Global Fortune 500, 85% of the U.S. Fortune 1000 and more than 20,000 middle market clients. 
Before we review our results today, I would like to provide an update on our integration efforts. While the merger was official as of January 4, you may recall our integration planning has been underway since July 2015. We recently brought together more than 200 of our global leaders for a formal kickoff of Willis Towers Watson in London during the second week of January. The purpose of the meeting was to talk about the vision for the company and have our leaders hope execute that vision upon their return home. 
I left that meeting with a few overall impressions. The shared values of our companies, the collaboration between colleagues and the focus on client relationships were all stronger than I anticipated when we announced this merger back in June. There were a couple of interesting aspects of the meeting. One was to see the enthusiasm of leadership, but also hear about the excitement taking place in the local offices. Within days of closing the merger, many of our colleagues in the local markets took the initiative to reach out to each other, start learning the product and service offerings of the legacy organizations and discuss how to respond to RFPs utilizing the best resources of the newly combined organization. The early feedback was loud and clear. The level of collaboration was quite extraordinary and the level excitement was more than we could have expected. It's unusual during the early stages following a merger for people in the newly created organization to grasp a long-term power behind the transaction. 
From the feedback I have received, our colleagues around the globe understand the power this union will create in serving our clients and are more enthusiastic about the vision than we could have hoped. While we are in the early days of this journey, we all appreciate the hard work ahead of us in making our long-term vision a reality. 
So for now, we'll continue to focus on our integration roadmap, which includes clearly defined revenue, expense and tax synergies, and appreciate the continued collaboration of the local market level will ultimately contribute to our success. 
Now let me provide an update on the synergy plans. We've articulated 3 areas of revenue synergies over the last 7 months: Penetrating the private healthcare exchange middle market; building relationships in the large corporate P&C businesses; and utilizing Willis and Gras Savoye's strong multinational relationships and brokers network for global benefits solutions. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss these integration efforts more specifically. I think you will see our extension intense integration planning help jump start our efforts very quickly after the close of the a number of our mid-market sales colleagues were in Buffalo during the week of January 25 for an intensive go-to-market training program with the active employee health care exchanges. This initial training session for the midmarket private healthcare marketing salesforce was quite successful. This group will continue to work with the exchange solutions leadership to provide training to the broad midmarket sales distribution network. 
We have been fortunate to secure a win with our first Willis Towers Watson midmarket exchange client and look forward to continuing to strengthen our midmarket reach. 
Turning to the large account U.S. P&C integration efforts, now that the merger has closed. Our account directors, the broking industry leads, are aggressively working with our target clients to build on our strong relationships and address the P&C needs for 2016 and beyond. We had our first significant win at the end of January. While this wasn't a joint sales efforts, the client worked with an highly respected legacy organizations. The client cited that the merger of Willis Towers Watson was viewed as a positive factor in assessing the RFP. This is a great example of the significant client relationship getting stronger. 
Now let's turn to the efforts in the global benefits solutions. We recently won 2 client projects as a direct result of expanding our country footprint and owning the distribution at pipeline of RFPs and have the ability to respond to opportunities that we just couldn't in the past. Merging the Towers Watson technology and products with the Willis and Gras Savoye distribution network and strong brands has given us an immediate strength and presence in the global benefit states. We also announced post merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually. 
On the cost front, corporate leaders provided their business cases identifying specific synergies that will be accountable for achieving over the next 3 years. The real estate and IT infrastructure portion of the cost synergy planning is most advanced at this stage. We also -- we are more confident than ever that our tax savings goals will be achieved. All of the integration into synergy activities I just mentioned also give us great confidence in our ability to achieve 25% EBITDA margin target by the end of our 3-year integration process in 2018. 
Finally, I would like to address the client response which has been very gratifying. We've had a number of wins as I have highlighted above and our clients openness for a discussion and a combination of joint marketing efforts in the first month has been very positive. I also had the opportunity to speak to many CEOs at the World Economic Forum last month. The response offering integrated solutions to enhance organizational performance by managing both risk in people was well received and the discussions were very engaging. 
Now we will review the full and fourth quarter 2015 Willis in the quarter ending December 31, 2015 or second quarter FY '16 Towers Watson results. We will also provide 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. As we discuss segment margin to our operating margins, please note the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include intangibles in discretionary compensation. The Towers Watson margins exclude both intangible and discretionary compensation. 
Now I will turn the call over to Dominic Casserley."

With the merger completed, we are very excited about the potential of the combined business. We are very pleased with the progress we have made to date on integration, the enthusiasm which our colleagues are approaching new integration and the reaction from our clients. Now turning to legacy Willis' results. The company reported another solid quarter that concluded a year of significant financial and operational achievements. 
Throughout the year, we faced some volatile market conditions and we have performed in spite of them. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.09 on an underlying basis, as we once again generated solid underlying commissions and fees growth of 9.5%, driven by strong organic growth and the contributions of our strategic acquisitions. Our underlying profit was held back by interest and amortization costs associated with the Miller acquisition, which produces most of its profits in the first half of the year and also by slightly lower earnings of associates. So we believe there's nearly 10% growth of our underlying EBITDA in the quarter, gives a clear read on the performance of the business. On an organic basis, CNF growth was a very strong 4.8% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, it was 3.3%, representing the fourth consecutive year of mid-single digit organic CNF growth and consistent with our stated annual goals with this metric. 
Through our focus on the execution of the Operational Improvement Program and other initiatives, our organic expense growth rate was well-below our revenue growth rate, and we once again exceeded the upgraded 200 basis point commitment we made in July 2015. The result was another quarter of organic operating margin expansion that fits in a row. As this has been the case all year, our performance in the fourth quarter was the result of our focus on and execution against our 3 pillar strategy. Generating organic growth through our diversified business is the first of these pillars and our strong performance is evident in the numbers I just discussed. I will briefly walk through the source of this growth at a business level in a moment. 
Our second pillar is our targeted M&A strategy. The quarters have progress on several fronts, including the continuous success on with Miller and the completion of our acquisition of Gras Savoye in December as expected. Overall, our acquisition program made consistently strong contributions to our growth throughout the year, and I have seen an underlying CNF growth in the fourth quarter. 
The third and final strategic pillar is the execution of our Operational Improvement Program. Once again, the OIP exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter generating $49 million in cost savings. During the third quarter call, I told you that our performance through the 9 months gave us confidence in our ability to drive further improved spread for the year, and I am pleased to say that we had again exceeded our target. So let me provide you with a bit more detail about how we achieved this performance in the quarter as well as provide some overall expectations for 2016. 
Willis International finished the year on a strong note as expected. Underlined revenue growth was 11.4% as Max Matthiessen and the IFG pension embedded business continue to contribute with segments performance. 
On an organic basis, international revenues rose 9%, demonstrating its continued solid momentum. Latin America led the way again with double-digit growth. We couldn't be more pleased with international performance in 2015. The business turned in excellent growth and profitability despite significant challenges in key geographies. 
With the addition of Gras Savoye, we expect 2016 constant currency revenue growth in the 50% range, while we expect organic growth in the mid-to high-single digits. In North America, organic revenue growth was 1.9%. The segment saw a strength in several industry practices, including double-digit growth in construction and real estate and hospitality as well as mid-single-digit organic growth in the Human Capital prices. Underlying revenue growth for the quarter was 0.6%, reflecting our decision to divest in a number of smaller, non-core businesses. 
Looking at 2016 all else being equal, we anticipate another solid year of revenue growth and margin improvement. Now let's turn to Willis capital in wholesale and reinsurance. CW&R generated underlying CNF growth of 13.3%, driven by the contribution to the Miller Insurance Services. 
Organic revenue declined 3.7%. Within this organic result, Willis Re and our key programs businesses continue to grow well. These areas of growth were more than offset by a decline in our fine arts jury and business. For the coming year, we expect CW&R reported growth to be in the mid-teens as Miller through the earlier quarters. Organic growth is expected to be in the low-to mid-single digit range in 2016, assuming we did not see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates. Finally, Willis GB ended the year with an excellent performance as our strategic efforts began to gain traction. Organic revenue growth was very strong in the quarter at 8.3%, underlying CNF growth was 9.4%. Our restructuring efforts drove a decrease in cost in the quarter and this in turn drove another quarter of profit expansion for this segment. 
Willis GB is positioned for further revenue and profit momentum in 2016. So all-in-all, a good quarter to end a great year and a positive outlook for 2016. 
Now before I hand the call over to John I would like to take a moment, given this will be John's last conference call with us, to thank him for his very significant contributions as the CFO of Willis. He has brought a very high level of corporate finance and day-to-day discipline to the company and has been a critical part of businesses and our technology and operations in driving outperformance of the Operational Improvement Program. We have been at the center of our processes related to Miller and Gras Savoye and he did this all while helping Willis execute on our game changing merger with Towers Watson. So from me and all of us at Willis, thank you very much, John. 
With that, I will now it over to John to discuss the Willis Financials in more detail."

It has been a team effort throughout and a pleasure working with you, the team and the board. Good morning to those on the call.

It has been a team effort throughout and a pleasure working with you, the team and the board. Good morning to those on the call. I will be working off the fourth quarter slide deck, which is available on our website. Starting at Slide 5, underlying earning through the quarter were flat with last year, $1.09 per diluted share. Our underlying revenue growth and cost management efforts drove an increase in operating income. The prior-year comparison is challenging because, as you may recall, in the fourth quarter 2014, there was a $12 million gain from a portfolio of sales. Removing this, underlying EPS would have been up approximately $0.13. The other $0.09 of declines in the quarter reflect increased amortization expense from acquisitions and slightly lower earnings from associates as we prepare Gras Savoye for full consolidation. 
On a reported basis, our results reflect adjusting items that in total reduced earnings by $1.44 per share. The adjusting items in the quarter included a gain of $0.85 per share from the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Gras Savoye. And cost of $0.64 of M&A transaction related expense primarily related to the merger with Towers Watson. $0.61 for litigation provision, $0.45 of restructuring charges associated with our Operational Improvement Program, $0.39 related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan Boulevard, we have return down the operation to $3 million on a book basis, and finally $0.20 related to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
The fourth quarter impact of currency headwinds was a negative $0.19 per share. Adjusting for share count, this was roughly $0.05 more than the guidance provided largely driven by further declines in the euro. The $0.61 provision I mentioned relates to previously disclosed litigation surrounding the Stanford financial group. Accounting standards require us to take into account a variety of factors and setting up the provision. To give one example, in cases where the expected cost of protracted litigation are significant, it's not unusual to have discussions with the from time-to-time where it make sense for the company. There are numerous other factors. And we believe we are appropriately provided for. 
But to be clear, we continue to dispute the allegation in the strongest terms and to defend ourselves vigorously, nothing has changed in that regard. Please note that because this is pending litigation, we are not in a position to comment on details. 
On Slide 6, a brief summary of the operational improvement program. You can see here that we continue to make progress against the program's objectives. The OIP generated $49 million in cost savings in the fourth quarter. For the year, cost savings totaled $112 million, 40% ahead of our $80 million target. Recall that this target was increased in July from our original $60 million guidance. We achieved the higher savings while spending 10% below our prior expectations. We are on track to deliver our increased annualized run rate cost savings target of $325 million. 
In summary, the OIP is achieving everything we held before. Slide 7 focuses on organic metrics. As you can see from the charts, the combination of our solid organic revenue growth and our focus on cost management is driving strong organic margin performance. We are very pleased with the consistent improvement in organic spread. The graph on the left shows the spread between organic commission and fee growth and organic expense growth has reached a new high of 280 basis points in the fourth quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of expansion in organic spread. For the year, we achieved a spread of 240 basis points. The impact of this can be seen on the graph on the right. Organic EBITDA has grown $12 million or 6.7% over the same period last year. 
Finally, turning to Slide 8. At the end of last year, we provided a scorecard that laid out some of our medium-term goals and progress against that. I am pleased to say that we have delivered against fall of these commitments. We generated mid-single digit organic CNF growth of 3.3% for the year. We achieved an improvement in organic spread of 240 basis points for the full year, well-ahead of our 200-basis-point target. Full year underlying EBITDA grow by over 9%, which we view as a good proxy for the cash flow of legacy Willis. On the cash flow front, we have had an important development with our U.K. pension. We concluding negotiations with the pension trustees, the result was the removal of the contingent funding requirements tied to EBITDA and buybacks and reduce noncontingent deficit contributions. Deficit contributions for 2015 were $75 million. In 2016, they were reduced to $53 million. For 2017 and forward, they will be $22 million or $37 million depending on progress towards deficit elimination. This is a nice pickup in cash flow while providing protection for the members of pension plan. 
Now before I hand the line over for the last time, let me say how much I have enjoyed working with all of you on the call. I would also like to wish John, Dominic, and Roger every success. I look forward to watching Willis Towers Watson deliver shareholder and customer value. 
Now let me pass the call over to Roger to take you through the Towers Watson's results for the second quarter. Roger?"

I would like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to participate on the first earnings call for Willis Towers Watson with John, Dominic and John Green. I think we are going to do something special here. As a long time CFO and finance professional, the vision of helping clients, find opportunity and create value through enhanced management of risk and people really resonates, and I am looking forward to what we are going to do for our clients in the marketplace. 
Turning to results, we are very pleased with the financials delivered by Towers Watson for the quarter. Reported revenues were $950 million, a decrease of 1%. This includes $42 million of unfavorable currency movements. Revenues increased by 3% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Our organic growth rate adjust for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Our adjusted EBITDA margin continue to be strong at 21.6%. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $11 million, a decrease from $110 million for the prior year's second quarter. The current quarter results include approximately $81 million of transaction and integration costs. 
Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter of fiscal 2016 was $120 million, a decrease from $122 million for the prior year's second quarter. The normalized tax rate for the quarter was 30%, which excludes the tax costs of repatriating overseas cash used to fund the Towers Watson shareholders special dividend. 
Stepping back from the final 2 quarters for Towers Watson, on a fiscal year-to-date basis, we achieved 5% constant currency revenue growth, a stabilized adjusted EBITDA margin of around 21%, and adjusted net income of $223 million versus $215 million. We are very pleased with our results and business momentum. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of Towers Watson's segments. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in benefits were flat, exchange solutions increased 41%, risk and financial services decreased 1% and rewards was flat. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reference constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each segment in more depth. For the quarter, the benefit segment had revenues of $467 million, retirement revenues decreased by 3%, health and group benefits revenues grew by 15% and technology and administration solutions was up 2%. There are more than 15 pension administration projects, which will go live throughout fiscal year '16. Revenue for these projects is recognized as the systems are delivered to the client. We expect benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the 2% to 3% range as it was in 2015. We anticipate the benefits segment margin to be in the mid- 30% range for calendar 2016. For the quarter, risk and financial services had revenues of $145 million, a decline of 1%. Risk consulting and software revenues decreased 2% and investment revenue decreased by 1%. The risk and financial services segment is expected to have low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth for calendar '16. Risk and financial services had a 25% NOI margin. The margin decreased as compared to fiscal year '15, primarily due to the revenue decline. We expect the RFS segment margin to be in the mid-20% range for 2016. 
Next, let's move on to talented rewards, which had revenues of $175 million, flat on a constant currency basis and up by 2% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year quarter, which experienced 11% revenue growth. Executive compensation revenues were up 7% as compared to 6% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '15. Executive compensation has had good momentum over the last several years due to the focus on executive pay around the globe. Data surveys and technology revenues decreased by 6%, driven by the disposition of our HR service delivery business, and declined 1% on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 10% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '15. 
As mentioned last quarter, compensation surveys were delivered ahead of schedule as compared to last year. So it's best to compare the first half of fiscal years 2016 and 2015. For the first half of the fiscal year, constant currency revenue growth for DST was 5% and organic revenue growth was 9%. Rewards talent and communication revenues increased 2% as compared to 14% growth in the prior year's second quarter. We continue to see a positive environment for the talent rewards segment. We expect mid-single digit revenue growth for the calendar year 2016. Talent rewards had a 37% NOI margin for the quarter. We expected that talent reward segment margin to be in the mid-to-high 20% range for calendar year '16. 
As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the July to December quarters. For the quarter, the exchange solutions segment had revenues of $132 million, an increase of 41%. On an organic basis, the exchange solutions segment grew by 33%. Our retiree and access exchanges revenue increased 24% due to an increase in membership base. The other exchange solutions businesses increased 64% and 45% on an organic basis. Components of this line of business include health and welfare administration, active exchanges and consumer directed accounts -- drivers included new clients in health and welfare administration and active exchanges as well as annual enrollment and ACA recording requirements in health and welfare administration. Our consumer directed accounts practice also contributed approximately $8 million in revenue this quarter. We met our goal for a strong enrollment season in exchanges. We expected to add approximately 220,000 retirees this season and ended up exceeding that with more than 240,000 retirees added on a net basis. On the active side, we met our target of adding approximately 100,000 eligible employees. Stepping back from all the healthcare benefits activity, whether it's consulting, movement into exchanges or administration, the environment is very constructive to grow. 
General economic uncertainty, organization's phasing cost pressures, regulatory changes and optimizing benefit delivery for employers and employees all support strong momentum for our healthcare benefits related businesses. We remain confident in the long-term growth in each of the lines of business in this segment and expect revenue growth in the low to mid-20% range for calendar year '16. Exchange solutions had a 15% NOI margin as compared to 13% in last year's second quarter. The other line of business lead this segment with a 21% NOI margin. 
For 2016, the exchange solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. In summary, we maintained our overall Towers Watson expectation of mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth in 2016, which indicates good continuing momentum from a very strong fiscal year '15 within EBITDA margin of around 21%. 
Before we leave segment results, I wanted to note that we continue to report the legacy segments for the quarter ending March 31, 2016. We plan to report the new Willis Towers Watson segment structure for the quarter ending June 30. 2016 results will file historical performance of Towers Watson segment structures. 
Now let me turn to capital allocation. First, as an overall framework, we will continue to emphasize a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility to balance value creating acquisitions with meaningful and consistent return of cash to shareholders, all in the context of maintaining an investment grade rated balance sheet. We set an annualized dividend rate of $1.92 a share, which equates to payout roughly equal to the prior aggregate of the 2 legacy companies. We feel that the resulting yield of about 1.7% and payout ratio of about 25% positions the company appropriately. 
We have some financing -- refinancing to do this year of the legacy Willis maturities and arrangements that were restructured for the mergers. We expect to begin in the near-term to go-to-market for a $1.5 billion to $2 billion of debt to push out our maturity profile and free up some additional capital flexibility. As our financial policy and investment approach is further defined, we expect further clarification of our approach in the April board meeting. We are planning to have an Analyst Day in September, which will provide more in-depth guidance and business strategy. However, in the meantime, we will continue to provide results on the merger-related revenue, costs and tax synergies on a quarterly basis. We will also continue to report the impacts of the Operational Improvement Program and other significant matters that arise in relation to the integration efforts in our business momentum. 
Now let's review our overall guidance for fiscal year 2016. Due to purchase accounting rules, deferred revenues were not transferred to the merged company. This impacts the exchange software and administration businesses by approximately $75 million in total. We will also be incurring transaction-related costs such as legal costs, bankers cost, integration cost, tax costs and other merger and integrated related items. These costs will be -- will continue to be material as we work through the integration period. Both deferred revenues and transaction integrated related cost will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we expect constant currency revenue growth in the low double digits with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. We expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 19.5%, an increase from 19.1% in calendar 2015. The tax rate is expected to be in the mid-20% range. We originally expected to achieve this level by the end of 2017. We were able to generate more potential tax benefit than expected in the merger structuring. However, it is still too early to say how quickly the full impact will flow through to the accounting results. We expect fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.45 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro. The dollar has strengthened against many currencies since the S-4 projections were compiled in May. Due to the currency headwinds, we anticipate approximately $0.15 of negative impact to adjusted EPS on a year-over-year basis, which is incorporated in the guidance. 
In finishing up, I wanted to acknowledge that there is a lot of complexity here for investors.

So first, as you step back from the S-4 projections, which were done in April to May timeframe of last year, really on the aggregate basis, the biggest difference relates to foreign currency. And you can actually see it if you go back to the Towers Watson earnings call -- and I don't know the April or May last year. The pound guidance at that point was the $1.57 and the euro guidance was $1.20. If you adjust for that to our guidance now, overall, for the legacy companies, we would loose about $0.25. So you could add $0.25 to the range in a quite back to the legacy company guidance. In terms, more broadly the items that we would add to that guidance from the S-4 projections, the synergy estimates, I think we're largely on track with what we articulated through the whole merger discussion period with revenues coming in more strongly as the years build with some reasonable spread of cost synergies over the time period. And then on the tax side, again, as I said in my remarks, we had been articulating during that merger discussion period that we didn't think we could get from an accounting point of view to that mid-20% range for the tax rate until the end of 2017. And again, as I said, the merger structuring came out favorably, that's where we are guiding for fiscal and calendar '16. And so we feel good about our momentum on the tax side."

So in terms of the margin performance there, we can't expect a lower level of overall margin for Gras Savoye versus the organic margin. And largely that has to do with some opportunities both on the expense side as well further penetrating large clients. So when you adjust for the difference in French GAAP to U.S. GAAP, you get to a margin of about 16% net Willis around the 20 range. So there would be some overall dilution to the margins, but if you go back in terms of the rational for the deal and how we paid for it, it had to do with the EBITDA that the business was droving off. There is also going to be some increased amortization, which obviously does not get impact the cash flows, but it certainly will impact the overall margin rates."

So I will apologize on behalf of accounts for this complexity, but it's all accounting. This is Roger Millay. In our businesses that are really administration service oriented, we spread revenue, we collect the cash upfront and spread the revenue over a time period. And that's impacted the exchange solutions and the administration revenues particularly. So the way that comes in is we put up the cash that comes in on the balance sheet and amortize it into revenue over the service period and the contract period. When you do purchase accounting, that's an asset that is assigned a 0 value. So you write it off. Even though, in the flow of those contracts with clients that is revenue that was earned. And as you go forward in that business, it's indicative of the trend of revenue. So as we looked at it from an adjusted earnings point of view, and I would also add there is no cost associated with it. Again, this is just an accounting matter. So in order to give the clearest view of what the momentum of the go forward combined businesses, we felt it appropriate and actually necessary for investors to really know what the momentum of the company is to add that deferred revenue effectively that amortization back into the P&L. It's something that will go away after the first year and will actually diminish and impact as the quarters go by this year, and again this is just an accounting adjustment. I know that's something a little different that we deal with on the Towers Watson side. So certainly, we will answer all questions about it, but it's something that it shouldn't be a concern.

Now let's say, it was a very wide range of $100 million to $400 million. The reason for that was just some uncertainty about how fast that market will develop and the particular trajectory it will take. So we still -- does that's 1 that offers the largest potential upside there and it's -- we still feel very good. In fact, I think probably feel even better than ever the fact that Willis Towers Watson will be able to offer such an attractive product in the midmarket space in the U.S. We thinks that vitally important and we think the merger has really enhanced our ability to compete there considerably. The one that will probably see the fastest ramp up, but it's not as large say potential synergy -- we are talking in the $75 million to $100 million range, 3 years out, but that's the global benefits business. And part of the reason that will ramp up faster is, we had developed some products to go-to-market at Towers Watson, we can immediately link that up with the Willis and Gras Savoye distribution systems. And so we start immediately pulling claims in. I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we already had 2 big wins in January from that. So I think in terms of speed to get to the revenue synergies, I would put that as the most attractive 1 in terms of the largest overall potential though it's clearly the midmarket exchanges."

And we have been to a process of modernizing the business to really bring out underlying great strengths and franchises. That has been coming to provision.  And joined us at the beginning of 2015 and continued that and accelerated I think very strongly with a very strong team around him. And what you are seeing is the fruits of all that work, fruits of the underlying franchises, which remain very, very strong and the fruits of the discipline and focus that the team and Nicholas the leadership team has brought to it. And that's why I think we are so optimistic about the outlook for 2016 because we have real momentum, both momentum on the top line and momentum on the bottom line. For the quarter, though there were just some good wins in the quarter, that business is subject -- it is a business which had some big transactions in it which can move in and out. And for instance, we had some satellites. We have the leading in the satellite business and we had some satellite actually go off and going to orbit and let's say in the end of the year and that was good news for the business, right?

I'm very excited to be conducting our first Willis Towers Watson earnings call. In fact, this call actually represents the union of 3 historic organizations: Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye. Gras S",1123,"Thanks very much, Aida, and good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be conducting our first Willis Towers Watson earnings call. In fact, this call actually represents the union of 3 historic organizations: Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye. Gras Savoye, the leading insurance broker in France with a strong presence in Africa, the Middle East and part of Europe, became part of Willis on December 29, 2015. The merger of Willis and Towers Watson was completed as of January 4, 2016. 
We are now an organization of more than 39,000 colleagues serving more than 120 countries, 90% of the Global Fortune 500, 85% of the U.S. Fortune 1000 and more than 20,000 middle market clients. 
Before we review our results today, I'd like to provide an update on our integration efforts. While the merger was official as of January 4, you may recall our integration planning has been underway since July 2015. We recently brought together more than 200 of our global leaders for a formal kickoff of Willis Towers Watson in London during the second week of January. The purpose of the meeting was to talk about the vision for the company and have our leaders help execute that vision upon their return home. 
I left that meeting with a few overall impressions. The shared values of our companies, the collaboration between colleagues and the focus on client relationships were all stronger than I anticipated when we announced this merger back in June. There were a couple of interesting aspects of the meeting. One was to see the enthusiasm of leadership, but also hear about the excitement taking place in the local offices. Within days of closing the merger, many of our colleagues in the local markets took the initiative to reach out to each other, start learning the product and service offerings of the legacy organizations and discuss how to respond to RFPs utilizing the best resources of the newly combined organization. The early feedback was loud and clear. The level of collaboration was quite extraordinary, and the level of excitement was more than we could have expected. 
It's unusual during the early stages following a merger for people in the newly created organization to grasp the long-term power behind the transaction. From the feedback I received, our colleagues around the globe understand the power this union will create in serving our clients and are more enthusiastic about the vision than we could have hoped. While we're in the early days of this journey, we all appreciate the hard work ahead of us in making our long-term vision a reality. 
So for now, we'll continue to focus on our integration road map, which includes clearly defined revenue, expense and tax synergies, and appreciate that continued collaboration at the local market level will ultimately contribute to our success. 
Now let me provide an update on the synergy plans. We've articulated 3 areas of revenue synergies over the last 7 months: penetrating the private health care exchange middle market; building relationships in the large corporate P&C business; and utilizing Willis and Gras Savoye's strong multinational relationships and brokerage network for global benefits solutions.  I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss these integration efforts more specifically. 
I think you'll see our extensive, intense integration planning help jump start our efforts very quickly after the close of the deal on January 4. A number of our mid-market sales colleagues were in Buffalo during the week of January 25 for an intensive go-to-market training program for the active employee health care exchanges. This initial training session for the mid-market private health care marketing sales force was quite successful. This group will continue to work with                                      the exchange solutions leadership to provide training to the broad mid-market sales distribution network. 
We've been fortunate to secure a win with our first Willis Towers Watson mid-market exchange client and look forward to continuing to strengthen our mid-market reach. 
Turning to the large account U.S. P&C integration efforts. Now that the merger has closed, our account directors, the brokering and industry leads are aggressively working with our target clients to build on our strong relationships and address their P&C needs for '2016 and beyond. We had our first significant win at the end of January. While this wasn't a joint sales effort, the client worked with and highly respected legacy organizations. The client cited that the merger of Willis Towers Watson was viewed as a positive factor in assessing the RFP. This is a great example of a significant client relationship getting stronger. 
Now let's turn to the efforts in the global benefits solutions. We recently won 2 client projects as a direct result of expanding our country footprint and owning the distribution network. We're seeing a strong pipeline of RFPs and have the ability to respond to opportunities that we just couldn't in the past. Merging the Towers Watson technology and products with the Willis and Gras Savoye distribution network and strong brands has given us an immediate strength and presence in the global benefits space. 
We also announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually. On the cost front, corporate leaders provided their business cases, identifying specific synergies they'll be accountable for achieving over the next 3 years. The real estate and IT infrastructure portion of the cost synergy planning is most advanced at this stage. We also feel more confident than ever that our tax savings goals will be achieved. All of the integration and synergy activities I just mentioned also give us great confidence in our ability to achieve the 25% EBITDA margin target by the end of our 3-year integration process in 2018. 
Finally, I'd like to address the client response, which has been very gratifying. We had a number of wins, as I've highlighted above, and our clients' openness for a discussion and a combination of joint marketing efforts in the first month has been very positive. I also had the opportunity to speak to many CEOs at The World Economic Forum last month. The response to offering integrated solutions to enhance organizational performance by managing both risk and people was well received, and the discussions were very engaging. 
Now we'll review the full and fourth quarter 2015 Willis and the quarter ending December 31, 2015 or second quarter FY '16 Towers Watson results. We'll also provide 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note that metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include intangibles and discretionary compensation. The Towers Watson margins exclude both intangible and discretionary compensation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Dominic Casserley."

With the merger completed, we are very excited about the potential for the combined business. We are very pleased with the progress we've made to date on integration, the enthusiasm with which our colleagues are approaching the integration and the reaction from our clients. Now turning to legacy Willis' results. The company reported another solid quarter that concluded a year of significant financial and operational achievements. 
Throughout the year, we faced some volatile market conditions, and we have performed in spite of them. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.09 on an underlying basis, as we once again generated solid underlying commissions and fees growth of 9.5%, driven by strong organic growth and the contributions of our strategic acquisitions. Our underlying profit was held back by interest and amortization costs associated with the Miller acquisition, which produces most of its profits in the first half of the year, and also by slightly lower earnings of associates. So we believe that the nearly 10% growth of our underlying EBITDA in the quarter gives a clear read on the performance of the business. On an organic basis, C&F growth was a very strong 4.8% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, it was 3.3%, representing the fourth consecutive year of mid-single digit organic C&F growth and consistent with our stated annual goal for this metric. 
Through our focus on the execution of the Operational Improvement Program and other initiatives, our organic expense growth rate was well below our revenue growth rate, and we once again exceeded the upgraded 200 basis point commitment we made in July 2015. The result was another quarter of organic operating margin expansion, the fifth in a row. 
As has been the case all year, our performance in the fourth quarter was a result of our focus on and execution against our 3-pillared strategy. Generating organic growth through our diversified business is the first of these pillars, and our strong performance is evident in the numbers I just discussed. I will briefly walk through the source of this growth at a business level in a moment. 
Our second pillar is our targeted M&A strategy. The quarters all progressed on several fronts, including the continued successful involvement with Miller and the completion of our acquisition of Gras Savoye in December, as expected. Overall, our acquisition program made consistently strong contributions to our growth throughout the year, as seen in our underlying C&F growth in the fourth quarter. 
The third and final strategic pillar is the execution of our Operational Improvement Program. Once again, the OIP exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter, generating $49 million in cost savings. During the third quarter call, I told you that our performance through the 9 months gave us confidence in our ability to drive further improved spread for the year, and I'm pleased to say that we have again exceeded our target. 
So let me provide you with a bit more detail about how we achieved this performance in the quarter as well as provide some overall expectations for 2016. Willis International finished the year on a strong note as expected. Underlying revenue growth was 11.4% as Max Matthiessen and the IFG pension and benefits business continued to contribute to the segment's performance. On an organic basis, international's revenues rose 9%, demonstrating its continued solid momentum. Latin America led the way again with double-digit growth. We couldn't be more pleased with international performance in 2015. The business turned in excellent growth and profitability despite significant challenges in key geographies. 
With the addition of Gras Savoye, we expect 2016 constant-currency revenue growth in the 50% range, while we expect organic growth in the mid- to high single digits. 
In Willis North America, organic revenue growth was 1.9%. The segment saw a strength in several industry practices, including double-digit growth in Construction and Real Estate and Hospitality as well as mid-single-digit organic growth in the Human Capital Practice. Underlying revenue growth for the quarter was 0.6%, reflecting our decision to divest in a number of smaller, non-core businesses. Looking at 2016, all else being equal, we anticipate another solid year of revenue growth and margin improvement. 
Now let's turn to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CW&R generated underlying C&F growth of 30.3%, driven by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services. Organic revenue declined 3.7%. Within this organic result, Willis Re and our key progress businesses continued to grow well. These areas of growth were more than offset by a decline in our Fine Arts, Jewellery & Specie business. For the coming year, we expect CW&R reported growth to be in the mid-teens as Miller plays through the earlier quarters. Organic growth is expected to be in the low to mid-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we do not see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates. 
Finally, Willis GB ended the year with an excellent performance as our strategic efforts began to gain traction. Organic revenue growth was very strong in the quarter at 8.3%. Underlying C&F growth was 9.4%. Our restructuring efforts drove a decrease in cost in the quarter, and this in turn drove another quarter of profit expansion for the segment. Willis GB is positioned for further revenue and profit momentum in 2016. 
So all in all, a good quarter to end a great year and a positive outlook for 2016. 
Now before I hand the call over to John Greene, I would like to take a moment, given this will be John's last conference call with us, to thank him for his very significant contributions as the CFO of Willis. He has brought a very high level of corporate finance and day-to-day discipline to the company and has been a critical partner with the businesses and our technology and operations leaders in driving outperformance of the Operational Improvement Program. He has been at the center of our processes relating to Miller and Gras Savoye, and he did this all while helping Willis execute on our game-changing merger with Towers Watson. So from me and all of us at Willis, thank you very much, John. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to John to discuss the Willis financials in more detail."

It has been a team effort throughout and a pleasure working with you, the team and the board. Good morning to those on the call. I'll be working off the fourth quarter slide deck, which is available on our website. 
Starting on Slide 5, underlying earnings for the quarter were flat with last year at $1.09 per diluted share. Our underlying revenue growth and cost management efforts drove an increase in operating income. The prior year comparison is challenging because, as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of 2014, there was a $12 million gain from a portfolio sale. Removing this, underlying EPS would have been up approximately $0.13. The other $0.09 of declines in the quarter reflect increased amortization expense from acquisitions and slightly lower earnings from associates as we prepared Gras Savoye for full consolidation. 
On a reported basis, our results reflect adjusting items that, in total, reduced earnings by $1.44 per share. The adjusting items in the quarter included a gain of $0.85 per share from the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Gras Savoye; and cost of $0.64 of M&A transaction-related expense primarily related to the merger with Towers Watson, $0.61 for our litigation provisions, $0.45 of restructuring charges associated with our Operational Improvement Program, $0.39 related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, we have written down the operation to $3 million on a book basis, and finally $0.20 related to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
The fourth quarter impact of currency headwinds was a negative $0.19 per share. Adjusting for share count, this was roughly $0.05 more than the guidance provided, largely driven by further declines in the euro. 
The $0.61 provision I mentioned relates to previously disclosed litigation surrounding the Stanford Financial Group. Accounting standards require us to take into account a variety of factors in setting up the provision. To give one example, in cases where the expected cost of protracted litigation are significant, it is not unusual to have discussions with the plaintiff from time to time where it make sense for the company. There are numerous other factors, and we believe we are appropriately provided for. But to be clear, we continue to dispute the allegation in the strongest terms and to defend ourselves vigorously. Nothing has changed in that regard. Please note that because this is pending litigation, we are not in a position to comment on details. 
On Slide 6, a brief summary of the Operational Improvement Program. You can see here that we continue to make progress against the program's objectives. The OIP generated $49 million in cost savings in the fourth quarter. For the year, cost savings totaled $112 million, 40% ahead of our $80 million target. Recall that this target was increased in July from our original $60 million guidance. We achieved the higher savings while spending 10% below our prior expectations. We are on track to deliver our increased annualized run rate cost savings target of $325 million. In summary, the OIP is achieving everything we hoped for. 
Slide 7 focuses on organic metrics. As you can see from the charts, the combination of our solid organic revenue growth and our focus on cost management is driving strong organic margin performance. We are very pleased with the consistent improvement in organic spread. The graph on the left shows the spread between organic commission and fee growth and organic expense growth has reached a new high of 280 basis points in the fourth quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of expansion in organic spread. For the year, we achieved a spread of 240 basis points. The impact of this can be seen on the graph on the right. Organic EBITDA has grown $12 million or 6.7% over the same period last year. 
Finally, turning to Slide 8. At the end of last year, we provided a scorecard that laid out some of our medium-term goals and progress against them. I am pleased to say that we have delivered against all of these commitments. We generated mid-single digit organic C&F growth of 3.3% for the year. We achieved an improvement in organic spread of 240 basis points for the full year, well ahead of our 200 basis point target. Full year underlying EBITDA grew by over 9%, which we view as a good proxy for the cash flow of legacy Willis. 
On the cash flow front, we have had an important development with our U.K. pension. We concluded negotiations with the pension trustees. The result was the removal of the contingent funding requirements tied to EBITDA and buybacks and reduce noncontingent deficit contributions. Deficit contributions for 2015 were $75 million. In 2016, they will reduce to $53 million. For 2017 and forward, they will be $22 million or $37 million, depending on progress towards deficit elimination. This is a nice pickup in cash flow while providing protection for the members of the pension plan. 
Now before I hand the line over for the last time, let me say how much I've enjoyed working with all of you on the call. I'd also like to wish John, Dominic, and Roger every success. I look forward to watching Willis Towers Watson deliver shareholder and customer value. 
Now let me pass the call over to Roger to take you through the Towers Watson's results for the second quarter. Roger?"

As a lon",1783,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that I'm thrilled to participate on the first earnings call for Willis Towers Watson with John, Dominic and John Greene. I think we're going to do something special here. As a long-time CFO and finance professional, the vision of helping clients find opportunity and create value through enhanced management of risk and people really resonates, and I'm looking forward to what we're going to do for our clients in the marketplace. 
Turning to results, we're very pleased with the financials delivered by Towers Watson for the quarter. Reported revenues were $950 million, a decrease of 1%. This includes $42 million of unfavorable currency movements. Revenues increased by 3% on both a constant-currency and organic basis. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Our adjusted EBITDA margin continued to be strong at 21.6%. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $11 million, a decrease from $110 million for the prior year's second quarter. The current quarter results include approximately $81 million of transaction and integration costs. 
Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter of fiscal 2016 was $120 million, a decrease from $122 million for the prior year's second quarter. The normalized tax rate for the quarter was 30%, which excludes the tax costs of repatriating overseas cash used to fund the Towers Watson shareholders' special dividend. 
Stepping back from the final 2 quarters for Towers Watson, on a fiscal year-to-date basis, we achieved 5% constant-currency revenue growth, a stabilized adjusted EBITDA margin of around 21% and adjusted net income of $223 million versus $215 million. We're very pleased with our results and business momentum. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of Towers Watson's segments. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. On an overall constant-currency basis, revenues in Benefits were flat, Exchange Solutions increased 41%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 1% and Talent and Rewards was flat. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reference constant-currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each segment in more depth. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $467 million. Retirement revenues decreased by 3%, Health and Group benefits revenues grew by 15% and Technology and Administration Solutions was up 2%. 
There are more than 15 pension administration projects, which will go live throughout fiscal year '16. Revenue for these projects is recognized as the systems are delivered to the client. We expect Benefits' 2016 revenue growth will be in the 2% to 3% range, as it was in 2015. We anticipate the benefits segment margin to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016. 
For the quarter, Risk and Financial Services had revenues of $145 million, a decline of 1%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 2% and Investment revenue decreased by 1%. The Risk and Financial Services segment is expected to have low to mid-single-digit revenue growth for calendar '16. Risk and Financial Services had a 25% NOI margin. The margin decreased as compared to fiscal year '15, primarily due to the revenue decline. We expect the RFS segment margin to be in the mid-20% range for 2016. 
Next, let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $175 million, flat on a constant-currency basis and up by  2% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year quarter, which experienced 11% revenue growth. Executive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Compensation revenues were up 7% as compared to 6% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '15. Executive Compensation has had good momentum over the last several years due to the focus on executive pay around the globe. Data, Surveys and Technology revenues decreased by 6%, driven by the disposition of our HR service delivery business, and declined 1% on an organic basis compared to a strong comparable of 10% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '15. 
As mentioned last quarter, compensation surveys were delivered ahead of schedule as compared to last year, so it's best to compare the first half of fiscal years 2016 and 2015. For the first half of the fiscal year, constant-currency revenue growth for DST was 5% and organic revenue growth was 9%. Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues increased 2% compared to 14% growth in the prior year's second quarter. We continue to see a positive environment for the Talent and Rewards segment. We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for the calendar year 2016. Talent and Rewards had a 37% NOI margin for the quarter. We expect that Talent and Reward segment margin to be in the mid- to high-20% range for calendar year '16. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the July to December quarters. 
For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $132 million, an increase of 41%. On an organic basis, the exchange solutions segment grew by 33%. Our Retiree and Access Exchanges revenue increased 24% due to an increase in membership base. The other exchange solutions businesses increased 64% and 45% on an organic basis. Components of this line of business include health and welfare administration, active exchanges and Consumer Directed Accounts. Drivers included new clients in health and welfare administration and active exchanges as well as annual enrollment and ACA reporting requirements in health and welfare administration. Our Consumer Directed Accounts practice also contributed approximately $8 million in revenue this quarter. We met our goal for a strong enrollment season in exchanges. We expected to add approximately 220,000 retirees this season and ended up exceeding that, with more than 240,000 retirees added on a net basis. On the active side, we met our target of adding approximately 100,000 eligible employees. Stepping back from all the health care benefits activity, whether it's consulting, movement into exchanges or administration, the environment is very constructive to grow. 
General economic uncertainty, organizations facing cost pressures, regulatory changes and optimizing benefit delivery for employers and employees all support strong momentum for our health care benefits-related businesses. We remain confident in the long-term growth in each of the lines of business in this segment and expect revenue growth in the low to mid-20% range for calendar year '16. Exchange solutions had a 15% NOI margin as compared to 13% in last year's second quarter. The other line of business led this segment with a 21% NOI margin. 
For 2016, we expect [ph] the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. 
In summary, we maintain our overall Towers Watson expectation of mid-single-digit constant-currency revenue growth in 2016, which indicates good continuing momentum from a very strong fiscal year '15 with an EBITDA margin of around 21%. 
Before we leave segment results, I wanted to note that we'll continue to report the legacy segments for the quarter ending March 31, 2016. We plan to report the new Willis Towers Watson segment structure for the quarter ending June 30. Prior to releasing the June 30,2016, results, we'll file historical pro formas of [indiscernible] Towers Watson segment structures. 
Now let me turn to capital allocation. First, as an overall framework, we'll continue to emphasize a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility to balance value-creating acquisitions with meaningful and consistent return of cash to shareholders, all in the context of maintaining an investment-grade-rated balance sheet. We set an annualized dividend rate of $1.92 a share, which equates to a payout roughly equal to the prior aggregate of the 2 legacy companies. We feel that the resulting yield of about 1.7% and payout ratio of about 25% positions the company appropriately. 
We have some financing -- refinancing to do this year of the legacy Willis maturities and arrangements that were restructured for the mergers. We expect to begin, in the near term, to go to market for $1.5 billion to $2 billion of debt to push out our maturity profile and free up some additional capital flexibility. As our financial policy and investment approach is further defined, we expect further clarification of our approach in the April board meeting. We're planning to have an Analyst Day in September, which will provide more in-depth guidance and business strategy. However, in the meantime, we'll continue to provide results on the merger-related revenue, costs and tax synergies on a quarterly basis. We'll also continue to report the impacts of the Operational Improvement Program and other significant matters that arise in relation to the integration efforts and our business momentum. 
Now let's review our overall guidance for fiscal year 2016. Due to purchase accounting rules, deferred revenues were not transferred to the merged company. This impacts the exchange software and administration businesses by approximately $75 million in total. We'll also be incurring transaction-related costs such as legal costs, banker's costs, integration cost, tax costs and other merger- and integration-related items. These costs will be -- will continue to be material as we work through the integration period. Both deferred revenues and transaction- and integration-related cost will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we expect constant-currency revenue growth in the low double digits, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. We expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 19.5%, an increase from 19.1% in calendar 2015. The tax rate is expected to be in the mid-20% range. We originally expected to achieve this level by the end of 2017. We were able to generate more potential tax benefit than expected in the merger structuring. However, it is still too early to say how quickly the full impact will flow through to the accounting results. We expect fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.45 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro. The dollar has strengthened against many currencies since the S-4 projections were compiled in May. Due to the currency headwinds, we anticipate approximately $0.15 of negative impact to adjusted EPS on a year-over-year basis, which is incorporated in the guidance. 
And finishing up, I wanted to acknowledge that there's a lot of complexity here for investors. But I want to reiterate that we're very pleased with the way the 2 legacy companies have come together, and we think we're off to a quick start to delivering enhanced value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to John."

So first, as you step back from the S-4 projections, which were done in the April to May time frame of last year, really, on the aggregate basis, the biggest difference relates to foreign currency. And you can actually see it if you go back to the Towers Watson earnings call in, I don't know, it was the eighth or so of May last year. The pound guidance at that point was $1.57 and the euro guidance was $1.20. If you adjust for that to our guidance now, overall, for the legacy companies, we'd lose about $0.25. So you could add $0.25 to the range and equate back to the legacy company guidance. In terms, more broadly, of the items that we would add to that guidance from the S-4 projections, the synergy estimates, I think we're largely on track with what we articulated through the whole merger discussion period, with revenues coming in more strongly as the years build with some reasonable spread of cost synergies over the time period. And then on the tax side, again, as I said in my remarks, we had been articulating during that merger discussion period that we didn't think we could get, from an accounting point of view, to that mid-20% range for the tax rate until the end of 2017. And again, as I said, the merger structuring came out favorably. That's what we're guiding for fiscal and calendar '16. And so we feel good about our momentum on the tax side."

Let me address the first part of that 2-part question about enthusiasm retention within Willis. As I said, I quote what John Haley said about the level of enthusiasm within the organization overall and within sort of legacy Willis. I can tell you, it is extremely high. We had no retention issues. Actually, I was being briefed only yesterday that we're almost seeing the opposite. We're starting to see a number of people from other organizations who are being involved in the sort of the brokerage well, starting towards -- turning up at our doors and very, very intrigued and excited about what this new platform can do and be a platform for their careers. So at this point, we're feeling very comfortable."

Mark, in terms of free cash flow and, certainly, as you point out, there are a lot of things moving there. We don't have a formal forecast for free cash flow at this point, but I think you actually alluded to a number of the factors to be considered. So as we've looked at that and stepped back, one, I think it's fair to say, if you look over the last couple of years, that you have 2 legacy companies that demonstrated the capability to deliver somewhere in the range of $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow. Certainly, there are going to be integration costs. We do know that we have the costs related to the Operational Improvement Program that will still flow through. So we're dealing with those elements of planning. We'll expect, as we move into the next quarter's call, that we'll have more specific forecasts. But that's really how we're thinking about the free cash generation capability of the company right now."

I'll take a shot at that question related to Gras Savoye, and others are welcome to join in and make a comment. So in terms of the margin performance there, we can expect a lower level of overall margin for Gras Savoye versus the organic margin. And largely, that has to do with some opportunities, both on the expense side as well as further penetrating large clients. So when you adjust for the difference in French GAAP to U.S. GAAP, you get to a margin of about 16%, and that compares to Willis at around the 20% range. So there would be some overall dilution to the margins, but if you go back in terms of the rationale for the deal and how we paid for it, it had to do with the EBITDA that the business was throwing off. There's also going to be some increased amortization, which, obviously, does not going to impact the cash flows, but certainly will impact the overall margin rates."

So I'll apologize on behalf of us accountants for this complexity, but it's all accounting. This is Roger Millay. So we -- in our businesses that are really administration service-oriented, we spread revenue -- we collect the cash upfront and spread the revenue over a time period. And that's impacted Exchange Solutions and the administration revenues, particularly. So the way that comes in is we put up the cash that comes in on the balance sheet and amortize it into revenue over the service period and the contract period. When you do purchase accounting, that's an asset that is assigned a 0 value, so you write it off even though, in the flow of those contracts with clients, that is revenue that was earned. And as you go forward in that business, it's indicative of the trend of revenue. So as we looked at it from an adjusted earnings point of view -- and I'd also add, there's no cost associated with it. Again, this is just an accounting matter. So in order to give the clearest view of what the momentum of the go-forward combined businesses, we felt it appropriate and actually necessary for investors to really know what the momentum of the company is to add that deferred revenue -- effectively that amortization back into the P&L. It's something that will go away after the first year, and they'll actually diminish in impact as the quarters go by this year. And again, it's just an accounting adjustment. I know that's something a little different that we deal with on the Towers Watson side, so certainly, we'll answer all questions about it. But it's something that shouldn't be a concern."

Now it was a very wide range, $100 million to $400 million. And the reason for that was just some uncertainty about how fast that market will develop and the particular trajectory it will take. So we still -- that's the one that offers the largest potential upside there, and it's -- we still feel very good. In fact, I think, probably feel even better than ever about the fact that Willis Towers Watson will be able to offer such an attractive product in the mid-market space in the U.S. We think that's vitally important, and we think the merger has really enhanced our ability to compete there considerably. The one that we'll probably see the fastest ramp up, but it's not as large a potential synergy, we're talking in the $75 million to $100 million range 3 years out, but that's the global benefits business. And part of the reason that, that will ramp up faster is we had developed some products to go-to-market at Towers Watson. We can immediately link that up with the Willis and Gras Savoye distribution systems, and so we start immediately pulling claims in. I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we already had 2 big wins in January from that. So I think, in terms of speed to get to the revenue synergies, I would put that as the most attractive one in terms of the largest overall potential, though it's clearly the mid-market exchanges."

And that has been coming to fruition. Nicolas Aubert joined us the beginning of 2015 and continued that path and accelerated it, I think, very strongly with a very strong team around him. And what you are seeing is the fruits of all that work; fruits of the underlying franchises, which remain very, very strong and the fruits of the discipline and focus that the team and Nicolas -- the leadership team have brought to it. And that's why I think we're so optimistic about the outlook for 2016, because we have real momentum, both momentum on the top line and momentum on the bottom line. For the quarter, though, there were some good wins in the quarter, that business is subject -- it is a business which had some big transactions in it which can move in and out.

We've -- as you know, we raised target for what we could achieve to $325 million run rate. We feel very comfortable about that number. We are well on track. And as we said before, in 2016, the program should go cash-positive. That is the savings that it's delivering to the bottom line will exceed the cash cost of the restructuring charges that we will have to take in 2016. So you will see -- on all the fronts, you're going to see continued growth of the number of people we have, and the ratio we have in legacy Willis, if you like, our people in offshore centers versus on onshore. We were going to be restructuring a number of processes to make that possible to move roles offshore. We're continuing to densify our real estate, and that process will continue. And we'll be opening up, by the way, some new offshore centers for non-English-language back and middle office activities. So we have opened in Sophia [ph] to handle some of the European languages. We've opened a center -- another center in China to handle Mandarin. So you will see just a continuation of the continued discipline and progress we've announced.

36623,323377433,930667,"Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company","Executives","Thanks very much, Aida, and good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be conducting our first Willis Towers Watson earnings call. In fact, this call actually represents the union of 3 historic organizations: Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye. Gras S",1123,"Thanks very much, Aida, and good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be conducting our first Willis Towers Watson earnings call. In fact, this call actually represents the union of 3 historic organizations: Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye. Gras Savoye, the leading insurance broker in France with a strong presence in Africa, the Middle East and part of Europe, became part of Willis on December 29, 2015. The merger of Willis and Towers Watson was completed as of January 4, 2016. 
We are now an organization of more than 39,000 colleagues serving more than 120 countries, 90% of the Global Fortune 500, 85% of the U.S. Fortune 1000 and more than 20,000 middle market clients. 
Before we review our results today, I'd like to provide an update on our integration efforts. While the merger was official as of January 4, you may recall our integration planning has been underway since July 2015. We recently brought together more than 200 of our global leaders for a formal kickoff of Willis Towers Watson in London during the second week of January. The purpose of the meeting was to talk about the vision for the company and have our leaders help execute that vision upon their return home. 
I left that meeting with a few overall impressions. The shared values of our companies, the collaboration between colleagues and the focus on client relationships were all stronger than I anticipated when we announced this merger back in June. There were a couple of interesting aspects of the meeting. One was to see the enthusiasm of leadership, but also hear about the excitement taking place in the local offices. Within days of closing the merger, many of our colleagues in the local markets took the initiative to reach out to each other, start learning the product and service offerings of the legacy organizations and discuss how to respond to RFPs utilizing the best resources of the newly combined organization. The early feedback was loud and clear. The level of collaboration was quite extraordinary, and the level of excitement was more than we could have expected. 
It's unusual during the early stages following a merger for people in the newly created organization to grasp the long-term power behind the transaction. From the feedback I received, our colleagues around the globe understand the power this union will create in serving our clients and are more enthusiastic about the vision than we could have hoped. While we're in the early days of this journey, we all appreciate the hard work ahead of us in making our long-term vision a reality. 
So for now, we'll continue to focus on our integration road map, which includes clearly defined revenue, expense and tax synergies, and appreciate that continued collaboration at the local market level will ultimately contribute to our success. 
Now let me provide an update on the synergy plans. We've articulated 3 areas of revenue synergies over the last 7 months: penetrating the private health care exchange middle market, building relationships in the large corporate P&C business, and utilizing Willis and Gras Savoye's strong multinational relationships and brokerage network for global benefits solutions.  I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss these integration efforts more specifically. 
I think you'll see our extensive, intense integration planning helped jump-start our efforts very quickly after the close of the deal on January 4. A number of our mid-market sales colleagues were in Buffalo during the week of January 25 for an intensive go-to-market training program for the active employee health care exchanges. This initial training session for the mid-market private health care marketing sales force was quite successful. This group will continue to work with                                      the exchange solutions leadership to provide training to the broad mid-market sales distribution network. 
We've been fortunate to secure a win with our first Willis Towers Watson mid-market exchange client and look forward to continuing to strengthen our mid-market reach. 
Turning to the large account U.S. P&C integration efforts. Now that the merger has closed, our account directors, the brokering and industry leads are aggressively working with our target clients to build on our strong relationships and address their P&C needs for 2016 and beyond. We had our first significant win at the end of January. While this wasn't a joint sales effort, the client worked with and highly respected both legacy organizations. The client cited that the merger of Willis Towers Watson was viewed as a positive factor in assessing the RFP. This is a great example of a significant client relationship getting stronger. 
Now let's turn to the efforts in the global benefits solutions. We recently won 2 client projects as a direct result of expanding our country footprint and owning the distribution network. We're seeing a strong pipeline of RFPs and have the ability to respond to opportunities that we just couldn't in the past. Merging the Towers Watson technology and products with the Willis and Gras Savoye distribution network and strong brands has given us an immediate strength and presence in the global benefits space. 
We also announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually. On the cost front, corporate leaders provided their business cases, identifying specific synergies they'll be accountable for achieving over the next 3 years. The real estate and IT infrastructure portion of the cost synergy planning is most advanced at this stage. We also feel more confident than ever that our tax savings goals will be achieved. All of the integration and synergy activities I just mentioned also give us great confidence in our ability to achieve the 25% EBITDA margin target by the end of our 3-year integration process in 2018. 
Finally, I'd like to address the client response, which has been very gratifying. We had a number of wins, as I've highlighted above, and our clients' openness for a discussion and a combination of joint marketing efforts in the first month has been very positive. I also had the opportunity to speak to many CEOs at The World Economic Forum last month. The response to offering integrated solutions to enhance organizational performance by managing both risk and people was well received, and the discussions were very engaging. 
Now we'll review the full and fourth quarter 2015 Willis and the quarter ending December 31, 2015, or second quarter FY '16 Towers Watson results. We'll also provide 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note that metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include intangibles and discretionary compensation. The Towers Watson margins exclude both intangible and discretionary compensation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Dominic Casserley."

With the merger completed, we are very excited about the potential for the combined business. We are very pleased with the progress we've made to date on integration, the enthusiasm with which our colleagues are approaching the integration and the reaction from our clients. Now turning to legacy Willis' results. The company reported another solid quarter that concluded a year of significant financial and operational achievements. 
Throughout the year, we faced some volatile market conditions, and we have performed in spite of them. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.09 on an underlying basis, as we once again generated solid underlying commissions and fees growth of 9.5%, driven by strong organic growth and the contributions of our strategic acquisitions. Our underlying profit was held back by interest and amortization costs associated with the Miller acquisition, which produces most of its profits in the first half of the year, and also by slightly lower earnings of associates. So we believe that the nearly 10% growth of our underlying EBITDA in the quarter gives a clear read on the performance of the business. On an organic basis, C&F growth was a very strong 4.8% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, it was 3.3%, representing the fourth consecutive year of mid-single digit organic C&F growth and consistent with our stated annual goal for this metric. 
Through our focus on the execution of the Operational Improvement Program and other initiatives, our organic expense growth rate was well below our revenue growth rate, and we once again exceeded the upgraded 200 basis point commitment we made in July 2015. The result was another quarter of organic operating margin expansion, the fifth in a row. 
As has been the case all year, our performance in the fourth quarter was a result of our focus on and execution against our 3-pillar strategy. Generating organic growth through our diversified business is the first of these pillars, and our strong performance is evident in the numbers I just discussed. I will briefly walk through the source of this growth at a business level in a moment. 
Our second pillar is our targeted M&A strategy. The quarter saw progress on several fronts, including the continued successful involvement with Miller and the completion of our acquisition of Gras Savoye in December, as expected. Overall, our acquisition program made consistently strong contributions to our growth throughout the year, as seen in our underlying C&F growth in the fourth quarter. 
The third and final strategic pillar is the execution of our Operational Improvement Program. Once again, the OIP exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter, generating $49 million in cost savings. During the third quarter call, I told you that our performance through the 9 months gave us confidence in our ability to drive further improved spread for the year, and I'm pleased to say that we have again exceeded our target. 
So let me provide you with a bit more detail about how we achieved this performance in the quarter as well as provide some overall expectations for 2016. Willis International finished the year on a strong note, as expected. Underlying revenue growth was 11.4%, as Max Matthiessen and the IFG pension and benefits business continued to contribute to the segment's performance. On an organic basis, International's revenues rose 9%, demonstrating its continued solid momentum. Latin America led the way again with double-digit growth. We couldn't be more pleased with International's performance in 2015. The business turned in excellent growth and profitability despite significant challenges in key geographies. 
With the addition of Gras Savoye, we expect 2016 constant-currency revenue growth in the 50% range, while we expect organic growth in the mid- to high single digits. 
In Willis North America, organic revenue growth was 1.9%. The segment saw strength in several industry practices, including double-digit growth in Construction and Real Estate and Hospitality as well as mid-single-digit organic growth in the Human Capital practice. Underlying revenue growth for the quarter was 0.6%, reflecting our decision to divest a number of smaller, non-core businesses. Looking at 2016, all else being equal, we anticipate another solid year of revenue growth and margin improvement. 
Now let's turn to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CW&R generated underlying C&F growth of 30.3%, driven by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services. Organic revenue declined 3.7%. Within this organic result, Willis Re and our key programs businesses continued to grow well. These areas of growth were more than offset by a decline in our Fine Arts, Jewellery & Specie business. For the coming year, we expect CW&R reported growth to be in the mid-teens as Miller plays through the earlier quarters. Organic growth is expected to be in the low to mid-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we do not see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates. 
Finally, Willis GB ended the year with an excellent performance as our strategic efforts began to gain traction. Organic revenue growth was very strong in the quarter at 8.3%. Underlying C&F growth was 9.4%. Our restructuring efforts drove a decrease in costs in the quarter, and this in turn drove another quarter of profit expansion for the segment. Willis GB is positioned for further revenue and profit momentum in 2016. 
So all in all, a good quarter to end a great year and a positive outlook for 2016. 
Now before I hand the call over to John Greene, I would like to take a moment, given this will be John's last conference call with us, to thank him for his very significant contributions as the CFO of Willis. He has brought a very high level of corporate finance and day-to-day discipline to the company and has been a critical partner with the businesses and our technology and operations leaders in driving outperformance of the Operational Improvement Program. He has been at the center of our processes relating to Miller and Gras Savoye, and he did this all while helping Willis execute on our game-changing merger with Towers Watson. So from me and all of us at Willis, thank you very much, John. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to John to discuss the Willis financials in more detail."

It has been a team effort throughout and a pleasure working with you, the team and the board. Good morning to those on the call. I'll be working off the fourth quarter slide deck, which is available on our website. 
Starting on Slide 5. Underlying earnings for the quarter were flat with last year at $1.09 per diluted share. Our underlying revenue growth and cost management efforts drove an increase in operating income. The prior-year comparison is challenging because, as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of 2014, there was a $12 million gain from a portfolio sale. Removing this, underlying EPS would have been up approximately $0.13. The other $0.09 of declines in the quarter reflect increased amortization expense from acquisitions and slightly lower earnings from associates as we prepared Gras Savoye for full consolidation. 
On a reported basis, our results reflect adjusting items that, in total, reduced earnings by $1.44 per share. The adjusting items in the quarter included a gain of $0.85 per share from the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Gras Savoye; and cost of $0.64 of M&A transaction-related expense, primarily related to the merger with Towers Watson; $0.61 for our litigation provisions; $0.45 of restructuring charges associated with our Operational Improvement Program; $0.39 related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, we have written down the operation to $3 million on a book basis; and finally $0.20 related to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
The fourth quarter impact of currency headwinds was a negative $0.19 per share. Adjusting for share count, this was roughly $0.05 more than the guidance provided, largely driven by further declines in the euro. 
The $0.61 provision I mentioned relates to previously disclosed litigation surrounding the Stanford Financial Group. Accounting standards require us to take into account a variety of factors in setting up the provision. To give one example, in cases where the expected costs of protracted litigation are significant, it is not unusual to have discussions with the plaintiff from time to time, where it make sense for the company. There are numerous other factors, and we believe we are appropriately provided for. But to be clear, we continue to dispute the allegation in the strongest terms and to defend ourselves vigorously. Nothing has changed in that regard. Please note that because this is pending litigation, we are not in a position to comment on details. 
On Slide 6, a brief summary of the Operational Improvement Program. You can see here that we continue to make progress against the program's objectives. The OIP generated $49 million in cost savings in the fourth quarter. For the year, cost savings totaled $112 million, 40% ahead of our $80 million target. Recall that this target was increased in July from our original $60 million guidance. We achieved the higher savings while spending 10% below our prior expectations. We are on track to deliver our increased annualized run-rate cost savings target of $325 million. In summary, the OIP is achieving everything we hoped for. 
Slide 7 focuses on organic metrics. As you can see from the charts, the combination of our solid organic revenue growth and our focus on cost management is driving strong organic margin performance. We are very pleased with the consistent improvement in organic spread. The graph on the left shows the spread between organic commission and fee growth and organic expense growth has reached a new high of 280 basis points in the fourth quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of expansion in organic spread. For the year, we achieved a spread of 240 basis points. The impact of this can be seen on the graph on the right. Organic EBITDA has grown $12 million or 6.7% over the same period last year. 
Finally, turning to Slide 8. At the end of last year, we provided a scorecard that laid out some of our medium-term goals and progress against them. I am pleased to say that we have delivered against all of these commitments. We generated mid-single digit organic C&F growth of 3.3% for the year. We achieved an improvement in organic spread of 240 basis points for the full year, well ahead of our 200 basis point target. Full year underlying EBITDA grew by over 9%, which we view as a good proxy for the cash flow of legacy Willis. 
On the cash flow front, we have had an important development with our U.K. pension. We concluded negotiations with the pension trustees. The result was the removal of the contingent funding requirements tied to EBITDA and buybacks and reduced noncontingent deficit contributions. Deficit contributions for 2015 were $75 million. In 2016, they will reduce to $53 million. For 2017 and forward, they will be $22 million or $37 million, depending on progress towards deficit elimination. This is a nice pickup in cash flow while providing protection for the members of the pension plan. 
Now before I hand the line over for the last time, let me say how much I've enjoyed working with all of you on the call. I'd also like to wish John, Dominic, and Roger every success. I look forward to watching Willis Towers Watson deliver shareholder and customer value. 
Now let me pass the call over to Roger to take you through the Towers Watson's results for the second quarter. Roger?"

Turning to results, we're very pleased with the financials delivered by Towers Watson for the quarter. Reported revenues were $950 million, a decrease of 1%. This includes $42 million of unfavorable currency movements. Revenues increased by 3% on both a constant-currency and organic basis. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Our adjusted EBITDA margin continued to be strong at 21.6%. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $11 million, a decrease from $110 million for the prior-year's second quarter. The current quarter results include approximately $81 million of transaction and integration costs. 
Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter of fiscal 2016 was $120 million, a decrease from $122 million for the prior-year's second quarter. The normalized tax rate for the quarter was 30%, which excludes the tax costs of repatriating overseas cash used to fund the Towers Watson shareholders' special dividend. 
Stepping back from the final 2 quarters for Towers Watson, on a fiscal year-to-date basis, we achieved 5% constant-currency revenue growth, a stabilized adjusted EBITDA margin of around 21% and adjusted net income of $223 million versus $215 million. We're very pleased with our results and business momentum. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of Towers Watson's segments. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. On an overall constant-currency basis, revenues in Benefits were flat, Exchange Solutions increased 41%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 1% and Talent and Rewards was flat. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reference constant-currency, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each segment in more depth. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $467 million. Retirement revenues decreased by 3%, Health and Group benefits revenues grew by 15% and Technology and Administration Solutions was up 2%. 
There are more than 15 pension administration projects which will go live throughout fiscal year '16. Revenue for these projects is recognized as the systems are delivered to the client. We expect Benefits' 2016 revenue growth will be in the 2% to 3% range, as it was in 2015. We anticipate the Benefits segment margin to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016. 
For the quarter, Risk and Financial Services had revenues of $145 million, a decline of 1%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 2% and Investment revenue decreased by 1%. The Risk and Financial Services segment is expected to have low to mid-single-digit revenue growth for calendar '16. Risk and Financial Services had a 25% NOI margin. The margin decreased as compared to fiscal year '15, primarily due to the revenue decline. We expect the RFS segment margin to be in the mid-20% range for 2016. 
Next, let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $175 million, flat on a constant-currency basis and up by 2% on an organic basis as compared to the prior-year quarter, which experienced 11% revenue growth. Executive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Compensation revenues were up 7% as compared to 6% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '15. Executive Compensation has had good momentum over the last several years due to the focus on executive pay around the globe. Data, Surveys and Technology revenues decreased by 6%, driven by the disposition of our HR service delivery business, and declined 1% on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 10% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '15. 
As mentioned last quarter, compensation surveys were delivered ahead of schedule as compared to last year, so it's best to compare the first half of fiscal years 2016 and 2015. For the first half of the fiscal year, constant-currency revenue growth for DST was 5% and organic revenue growth was 9%. Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues increased 2% compared to 14% growth in the prior-year's second quarter. We continue to see a positive environment for the Talent and Rewards segment. We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for the calendar year 2016. Talent and Rewards had a 37% NOI margin for the quarter. We expect that Talent and Reward segment margin to be in the mid- to high-20% range for calendar year '16. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the July to December quarters. 
For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $132 million, an increase of 41%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 33%. Our Retiree and Access Exchanges revenue increased 24% due to an increase in membership base. The other exchange solutions businesses increased 64%, and 45% on an organic basis. Components of this line of business include health and welfare administration, active exchanges and Consumer Directed Accounts. Drivers included new clients in health and welfare administration and active exchanges as well as annual enrollment and ACA reporting requirements in health and welfare administration. Our Consumer Directed Accounts practice also contributed approximately $8 million in revenue this quarter. We met our goal for a strong enrollment season in exchanges. We expected to add approximately 220,000 retirees this season and ended up exceeding that, with more than 240,000 retirees added on a net basis. On the active side, we met our target of adding approximately 100,000 eligible employees. Stepping back from all the health care benefits activity, whether it's consulting, movement into exchanges or administration, the environment is very constructive to growth. 
General economic uncertainty, organizations facing cost pressures, regulatory changes and optimizing benefit delivery for employers and employees all support strong momentum for our health care benefits-related businesses. We remain confident in the long-term growth in each of the lines of business in this segment and expect revenue growth in the low to mid-20% range for calendar year '16. Exchange Solutions had a 15% NOI margin as compared to 13% in last year's second quarter. The other line of business led this segment with a 21% NOI margin. 
For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. 
In summary, we maintain our overall Towers Watson expectation of mid-single-digit constant-currency revenue growth in 2016, which indicates good continuing momentum from a very strong fiscal year '15, with an EBITDA margin of around 21%. 
Before we leave segment results, I wanted to note that we'll continue to report the legacy segments for the quarter ending March 31, 2016. We plan to report the new Willis Towers Watson segment structure for the quarter ending June 30. Prior to releasing the June 30, 2016, results, we'll file historical pro formas of the Willis Towers Watson segment structures. 
Now let me turn to capital allocation. First, as an overall framework, we'll continue to emphasize a capital allocation approach, focused on flexibility, to balance value-creating acquisitions with meaningful and consistent return of cash to shareholders, all in the context of maintaining an investment-grade-rated balance sheet. We set an annualized dividend rate of $1.92 a share, which equates to a payout roughly equal to the prior aggregate of the 2 legacy companies. We feel that the resulting yield of about 1.7% and payout ratio of about 25% positions the company appropriately. 
We have some financing -- refinancing to do this year of the legacy Willis maturities and arrangements that were restructured for the mergers. We expect to begin, in the near term, to go to market for $1.5 billion to $2 billion of debt, to push out our maturity profile and free up some additional capital flexibility. As our financial policy and investment approach is further defined, we expect further clarification of our approach in the April board meeting. We're planning to have an Analyst Day in September, which will provide more in-depth guidance and business strategy. However, in the meantime, we'll continue to provide results on the merger-related revenue, costs and tax synergies on a quarterly basis. We'll also continue to report the impacts of the Operational Improvement Program and other significant matters that arise in relation to the integration efforts and our business momentum. 
Now let's review our overall guidance for fiscal year 2016. Due to purchase accounting rules, deferred revenues were not transferred to the merged company. This impacts the exchange, software and administration businesses by approximately $75 million in total. We'll also be incurring transaction-related costs such as legal costs, banker's costs, integration costs, tax costs and other merger- and integration-related items. These costs will be -- will continue to be material as we work through the integration period. Both deferred revenues and transaction- and integration-related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we expect constant-currency revenue growth in the low double digits, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. We expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 19.5%, an increase from 19.1% in calendar 2015. The tax rate is expected to be in the mid-20% range. We originally expected to achieve this level by the end of 2017. We were able to generate more potential tax benefit than expected in the merger structuring. However, it is still too early to say how quickly the full impact will flow through to the accounting results. We expect fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.45 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro. The dollar has strengthened against many currencies since the S-4 projections were compiled in May. Due to the currency headwinds, we anticipate approximately $0.15 of negative impact to adjusted EPS on a year-over-year basis, which is incorporated in the guidance. 
And finishing up, I wanted to acknowledge that there's a lot of complexity here for investors. But I want to reiterate that we're very pleased with the way the 2 legacy companies have come together, and we think we're off to a quick start to delivering enhanced value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to John."

So first, as you step back from the S-4 projections, which were done in the April to May time frame of last year, really, on the aggregate basis, the biggest difference relates to foreign currency. And you can actually see it if you go back to the Towers Watson earnings call in, I don't know, it was the 8th or so of May last year. The pound guidance at that point was $1.57 and the euro guidance was $1.20. If you adjust for that to our guidance now, overall, for the legacy companies, we'd lose about $0.25. So you could add $0.25 to the range and equate back to the legacy company guidance. In terms, more broadly, of the items that we would add to that guidance from the S-4 projections, the synergy estimates, I think we're largely on track with what we articulated through the whole merger discussion period, with revenues coming in more strongly as the years build, with some reasonable spread of cost synergies over the time period. And then on the tax side, again, as I said in my remarks, we had been articulating during that merger discussion period that we didn't think we could get, from an accounting point of view, to that mid-20% range for the tax rate until the end of 2017. And again, as I said, the merger structuring came out favorably. That's what we're guiding for fiscal and calendar '16. And so we feel good about our momentum on the tax side."

Certainly, there are going to be integration costs. We do know that we have the costs related to the Operational Improvement Program that will still flow through.

So in terms of the margin performance there, we can expect a lower level of overall margin for Gras Savoye versus the organic margin. And largely, that has to do with some opportunities, both on the expense side as well as further penetrating large clients. So when you adjust for the difference in French GAAP to U.S. GAAP, you get to a margin of about 16%, and that compares to Willis at around the 20% range. So there would be some overall dilution to the margins, but if you go back in terms of the rationale for the deal and how we paid for it, it had to do with the EBITDA that the business was throwing off. There's also going to be some increased amortization, which, obviously, that's not going to impact the cash flows, but certainly will impact the overall margin rates."

In the guidance table, you labeled that as nonrecurring, but that's coming from all of the businesses that would be generating some revenue there going forward. So how do you think about that versus what you'll do in 2017? And then is there any expense associated with that? Because it looks like it's coming through at 100% margin."

So I'll apologize on behalf of us accountants for this complexity, but it's all accounting. This is Roger Millay.

So I'll apologize on behalf of us accountants for this complexity, but it's all accounting. This is Roger Millay. So we -- in our businesses that are really administration service-oriented, we spread revenue -- we collect the cash up front and spread the revenue over a time period. And that's impacted Exchange Solutions and the administration revenues, particularly. So the way that comes in is we put up the cash that comes in on the balance sheet and amortize it into revenue over the service period and the contract period. When you do purchase accounting, that's an asset that is assigned a 0 value, so you write it off even though, in the flow of those contracts with clients, that is revenue that was earned. And as you go forward in that business, it's indicative of the trend of revenue. So as we looked at it from an adjusted earnings point of view -- and I'd also add, there's no cost associated with it. Again, this is just an accounting matter. So in order to give the clearest view of what the momentum of the go-forward combined business is, we felt it appropriate and actually necessary for investors to really know what the momentum of the company is to add that deferred revenue -- effectively that amortization back into the P&L. It's something that will go away after the first year, and it'll actually diminish in impact as the quarters go by this year. And again, it's just an accounting adjustment. I know that's something a little different that we deal with on the Towers Watson side, so certainly, we'll answer all questions about it. But it's something that shouldn't be a concern."

Now it was a very wide range, $100 million to $400 million. And the reason for that was just some uncertainty about how fast that market will develop and the particular trajectory it will take. So we still -- that's the one that offers the largest potential upside there, and it's -- we still feel very good. In fact, I think, probably feel even better than ever about the fact that Willis Towers Watson will be able to offer such an attractive product in the mid-market space in the U.S. We think that's vitally important, and we think the merger has really enhanced our ability to compete there considerably. The one that we'll probably see the fastest ramp up, but it's not as large a potential synergy, we're talking in the $75 million to $100 million range 3 years out, but that's the global benefits business. And part of the reason that, that will ramp up faster is we had developed some products to go-to-market at Towers Watson. We can immediately link that up with the Willis and Gras Savoye distribution systems, and so we start immediately pulling claims in. I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we already had 2 big wins in January from that. So I think, in terms of speed to get to the revenue synergies, I would put that as the most attractive one. In terms of the largest overall potential, though it's clearly the mid-market exchanges."

We've been -- you've heard us talk about Willis GB for a number of quarters now, and this has been a long-term program. As you know, it is the great historic strength of Willis. It's one -- where one of the -- our most advanced capabilities sit. And we've been through a process of modernizing the business to really bring out its underlying great strengths and franchises. And that has been coming to fruition. Nicolas Aubert joined us the beginning of 2015 and continued that path and accelerated it, I think, very strongly with a very strong team around him. And what you are seeing is the fruits of all that work: fruits of the underlying franchises, which remain very, very strong, and the fruits of the discipline and focus that the team and Nicolas -- the leadership team have brought to it. And that's why I think we're so optimistic about the outlook for 2016, because we have real momentum, both momentum on the top line and momentum on the bottom line. For the quarter, though, there were some good wins in the quarter. That business is subject -- it is a business which has some big transactions in it which can move in and out. And for instance, we had some satellites. We have a leading player in the satellite business, and we had some satellite actually go off and go into orbit, I'm glad to say, in the end of the year, and that was good news for the business, right?

Good morning, everyone. Today, we will review's our results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide some guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results for this quarter. Our",2043,"Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today, we will review's our results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide some guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results for this quarter. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the Legacy Willis and Towers Watson structure. We anticipate providing consolidated segments results for the second quarter of 2016 during our August earnings call. 
Before we review our first quarter 2016 results, I'd like to say how pleased I'm to see the focus and excitement our colleagues have brought to the marketplace, and the collaboration it's taking place at all levels of the organization. I want to thank all of our colleagues for the spirit they have shown today and all of the hard work is keeping us on point for achieving our long-term goals. We're pleased with how we perform this quarter. 
Reported revenues for the quarter were to $.2 million, which includes $53 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Despite the currency headwinds, adjusted revenues, which include $32 million of deferred revenues were up 16% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an organic basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues. The prior year first quarter pro forma at adjusted EBITDA was $579 million or 28.8%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye. Miller and Gras Savoye produced most of the profits in the first half of the calendar year. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $326 million or 15% of revenue. The prior year first quarter pro forma operating income was $369 million or 18%. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues and for the prior year quarter was $540 million or 26.8% on a pro forma basis. 
For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.75, an adjusted diluted earings per share were $3.41. Roger will address the adjusted EPS in more detail later in the call. 
I'd also like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration, revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First let's discuss the revenue synergies. We recently updated our revenue tracking tools and plan to have more detailed revenue synergies updates by the  third quarter. However, as a travel to the various offices to see first and the collaborative sales efforts and hear about our market success, it's clear our colleagues are not waiting for top down integration mandate or reporting tools to go-to-market. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in a previous communications, global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We found another a 3 healthcare global solution clients and the pipeline looks very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange opportunities, we won 9 new clients for the 2017 enrollment season and continued to see the pipeline built. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we were awarded all the P&C lines for a multibillion-dollar construction organization. 
We're also seeing some success scenarios we did fully appreciate prior to the merger. As an example, we were recently awarded the global P&C business for a large multinational based outside of the U.S. The sales team incorporated the knowledge of the company from both legacy organizations, so that we can tailor a solution that was in alignment with the clients needs. The client noted that our strong collaboration and the depth of our analytical capabilities set us apart from the competition and help us look at the prevailing interest and the data issues from a very new and different perspective. 
Within just 4 weeks of bringing Willis Towers Watson together, we were able to come together as a single global team and radically change the way the client view Willis Towers Watson. We also experienced to win recently with French multinational in an area we have no formal revenue synergy targets. Gras Savoye had a long-standing relationship with this client in healthcare and property and casualty. Joining forces with the Gras Savoye relationship team was a team of Talent and Reward consultants who were hired for grading project. This was a great example of the full array of services we can now provide our clients. 
While these early wins may not have a significant immediate financial impact, we're very pleased with the progress we made towards our revenue synergies. These wins are further proved to the strong culture alignment to the merged organizations and perhaps most importantly, these wins demonstrate that when we put client needs first and help them succeed, we will succeed. Seeing the overall level of sales activity we have to date, I'm more confident than ever about our achieving our 2018 revenue synergy objectives. 
Now, moving to the cost and tax synergies. We announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually, with these objectives achievable over a 3-year post-merger integration period. We budget a $20 million in cost synergies for 2016, with an expected run rate of approximately $30 million of annualized savings and fully expect to meet our overall savings objectives by the end of 2018.  We should ultimately exceed our tax goals of $75 million of annual tax savings. 
As a side note, regarding the recently issued treasury roles, our outside advisors and tax group reviewed the treasury regulations thoroughly, and we feel confident these regulations will not impact our current or longer-term tax savings. 
I'd also like to address the legacy Willis Operational Improvement Program or now what we'll refer to as OIP. We continued to see this program as an important factor in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin objective by the end of 2018. We'll continue to provide color on the program and highlight savings, but we'll focus on the margin impact rather than spread between revenue and expense growth. Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $94 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. The momentum of continuing savings will be sustained throughout the year. We continued to be committed to saving $320 million by the end of 2017.  This quarter, we incurred about $25 million of restructuring cost, and overall, we spent approximately $140 million in 2016. This program continues to be on track to meet all of his financial objectives. 
1 significant step taking place this month is the restructuring of mid-and back-office colleagues in Great Britain. As a reminder, much of the program is focused on streamlining processes and moving office and administrative functions to the lower cost locations. Great Britain was one of the first regions to adopt the OIP, and now entering the last phase of the project. They're on track to achieve savings goals on schedule and on budget. We continued to believe the majority that company OIP savings will drop to the bottom line, and we're driving internal accountabilities to ensure that happens.  We will have more detailed information on margin impact during our Analyst Day in September. 
Now I'll review the first quarter 2016 legacy Towers Watson segment results and outlook and Roger will provide the legacy Willis results and provide updated 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. As we discussed segment margins or operating margins, please not the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include amortization, cash incentives and some of the restructuring costs, whereas Towers Watson margin exclude amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition cost and discretionary compensation. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of legacy Towers Watson's segment. On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in Benefit increased 1%, Exchange Solutions increased 57%, risk and financial services decreased 4%, and Talent and Rewards decreased 9%. All of the revenue results discussed in this segment detailed guidance will reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. So let's look at each segment in more depth, starting with Benefits. 
For the quarter, the Benefit segment had revenues of $486 million, which represents a 1% increase as compared to a 5% pro forma revenue increase in the first quarter of 2015. Retirement revenues decreased by 2%, Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 8% and Technology and Administration Solution revenues were up 8%. We don't anticipate any special demand for actuarial consulting services in 2016. Demand is expected to be good for healthcare consulting and technology and administration is expected to go live with many client implementations throughout the year, which will drive additional revenues. 
We expect Benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the low-single-digit range. Benefits had an NOI margin of 36%, and we continue to expect this segment to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016. 
Exchange Solutions had an outstanding quarter, with revenues of $152 million, a pro forma increase of 57%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 48%, driven by record enrollments, and Exchange revenue increased 47% and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 73%, and 49% on an organic basis. Increased enrollments in new client revenues drove the revenue increases. Our Consumer Directed Accounts practice also contributed approximately $9 million in revenue this quarter. 
We believe the increase in lives will continue to support good growth for the rest of 2016, but we don't expect much off cycle work during the calendar year. We have increased revenue growth expectations from low to mid-20% to a high 20% range for calendar year '16. 
Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin as compared to 21% in last year's first quarter. The Retiree and Access Exchanges line business led this segment with a 48% NOI margin. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the high teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year. 
For the quarter, Risk and Financial services had revenues of $144 million, a pro forma decline of 4%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 5% due to a softness in EMEA life consulting and a general softness in demand in the Americas. Investment revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in EMEA as demand softened for advisory services. 
The Risk and Financial services segment is expected to have low-single-digit revenue growth for calendar year '16. We recently invested in senior marketing staff and the pipeline appears to be greater than at this point, last year. We anticipate the impact of our marketing investments to impact revenues in the second half of the year. In addition, the prior year comparables for investments aren't as tough.  Risk and Financial services had a 23% NOI margin, and we expect to manage the business to achieve mid-20% margins. 
Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $124 million, down 9% on a pro forma constant currency basis and down 6% on a pro forma organic basis, as compared to the prior year quarter, which experienced 15% revenue growth. 
Executive Compensation revenues were down 1% as compared to 11% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Data, Surveys and Technology revenues decreased by 15%. We saw a 4% decline on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 9% revenue growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. As a reminder, we acquired Consulting and sold our HR Service Delivery business. 
Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased 9% as compared to 23% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Talent and Rewards had a 10% NOI margin for the quarter. The first half of the calendar year is generally soft for this segment. We see an overall decrease in the number of transactions in the market globally, and as a result, we anticipate this impacting segments topline results, given that we're lowering our revenue outlook from a mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth to a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with margins in the mid-20% range. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger"

I'd like to first reiterate John's comment on the great collaboration we're experiencing in Willis Towers Watson. The level of engagement have seen from the operating committee members to colleagues around the globe has been tremendous. It really is an exciting time to be part of Willis Towers Watson and based on the foundation being created now, I look forward to a very successful future. 
Before moving to the performance of the legacy Willis segments, I'd like to add more color on John's comments regarding the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I'd also like to discuss a couple of noteworthy adjustments to earnings, which were highlighted in the press release today. There were 2 significant positive impacts to adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
First, our adjusted tax rate came in at 19%, which was lower than our forecast, due to the seasonal strength of our profitability this quarter. We expect higher tax rates in the coming quarters, particularly in those quarters with seasonally lower operating profit. Second, our outstanding weighted average diluted share count came in lower-than-expected due to the merger closing 4 days into the quarter. This lowered our average diluted share count to approximately $136 million. The current outstanding diluted shares are approximately $138 million. 
Now let me turn to the reconciliation of segment operating income to income from operations, which was highlighted in our press release this morning. Most of these adjustments are self-explanatory, but I thought there were 2 items, which perhaps needed some additional explanation. First, amortization of $126 million represents the intangibles amortization, which is excluded from the legacy Towers Watson segment results. In addition to this, there is $35 million of amortization expense reported in the legacy Willis segment results. The reporting treatment will be uniformed next quarter when we report on the consolidated Willis Towers Watson segments. 
Second, as we've described in public filings, relevant parties have agreed din principal to settle the Stanford litigation for $120 million and seek of court issued bar order against all Stanford related claims. We recorded a $70 million provision in the December quarter based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The balance of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter once the settlement amount and terms were agreed.  The settlement with need final court approval, which have granted may take several quarters. This is still ongoing litigation. So we're not able to provide more details beyond what we've already said in our public filings. 
Now let me turn to the legacy Willis segment performance. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees or C&F for international increased by 84%; north America increased 3%; capital, wholesale and reinsurance increased by 14%; and Great Britain was flat. All of the C&F results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each of the legacy Willis segments in more depth. Turning to Willis International. With the consolidation of Gras Savoye, which contributed $235 million to revenue in the quarter, the top line grew 84% from the prior year. Gras Savoye contribution for the quarter was bit ahead of plan. On an organic basis, international C&F declined by 5%. This was driven by weakness in Asia and a cancelation adjustment for a large natural resources project. This cancellation was not related to the economic environment of the energy sector, but was political in nature. 
We continued to see strong growth in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The segments operating profit margin was 30% this quarter. Our outlook for organic C&F growth for the full year is in the mid-single-digit range with net operating margin in the low to mid-teen range. 
Willis North America had a nice start to the year with organic C&F growth of 4%. The segment saw a strength in all of it's core regions across a number of lines of business, most notably construction, financial institutions and Phoenix despite modest pricing headwinds. The human capital practice also contributed mid-single-digit organic growth during the quarter. The segments operating margin of 23% was modestly ahead of our expectations and a highlights some of the strategic changes we've been making related to the Operational Improvement Program. 
The outlook for Willis North America organic C&F growth continues to be in the low to mid-single digits with a margin in the high teens. 
Now turning to Willis capital Wholesale and Reinsurance. CW&R generated commissions and fees growth of 14%, driven primarily by the contributions of Miller Insurance services., which contributed $49 million of C&F in the quarter. Organic C&F declined 3%, primarily due to the year-over-year decline of our Fine Arts and Jewelry business as a result of the departure of the team of associates to JLT., for which we recently settled litigations as well as a strong comparable in reinsurance business, which benefited last year by an uplift of $6.5 million on a restructured account. 
CWR's operating margin was 46% as this segments business is seasonally rated -- weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect reported growth to be in the low double digits as Miller fully rolls through -- fully rolls on through the first of the year. Organic C&F growth is expected to be in the low-single digit range in 2016, assuming we don't see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates. 
I should note that in our growth guidance for CWR on a commission and fees basis, is lower than the total revenues guidance we provided previously. This results from the fact that the earlier guidance included the anticipated impact of the $40 million settlement with JLG, which will be recognized in the second quarter as other income in total revenues. This item will not be adjusted out of GAAP earnings, consistent with the historic practice. We expect operating margin to be in the low 20% range. 
Finally, Willis GB C&F growth was flat for the quarter. The cancellation adjustment for the large natural resources project mentioned earlier also impacted Willis GB. Organic C&F declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the natural resources project, organic growth would have been up approximately 2%. The segments reported operating margin was 14%, modestly lower as compared to the prior year, driven by the project-related revenue decline and some one-time expense adjustments. 
We continued to have a positive outlook for the business and these one-time revenue and expense events, which occurred this quarter are not indicative of our future outlook. Our outlook for organic C&F growth is in the low-single-digit range with margin in the high 20% range. 
Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. We issued a $1 billion of U.S. notes in March from $50 million at 3.5%, with a maturity date of September 21 and $550 million at 4.4% with a maturity date of March 26. We expect to go to the euro market for an additional $600 million to $800 million. Being in the market recently and finalizing the timing of our refinancing, we expect our interest charges to be approximately $200 million for the year 2016. 
The proceeds from the dollar offering were used to repay our $300 million public note, which matured in March, repay the USD 400 million tranche of our one -- 1 year banknote and reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. 
Let me turn now to capital allocation. As we mentioned, during the last earnings call, we expect to have a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility, while maintaining an investment grade rated balance sheet. On the Moody's basis, this equates to a threshold of approximately 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Currently, our Moody's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 3.7. We expect this to self correct over the next several quarters as our restructuring expenses declined, merger-related cost reduction programs are implemented and profits increase. 
We believe we have several hundred million dollars of capital allocation flexibility for the second half of the year. As always, we'll weight the benefit of potential acquisitions versus repurchasing shares. We prefer to do good actions, and after that look to share buybacks, consistent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. 
Free cash flow was $70 million this quarter. Free cash flow is expected to generally improve through each consecutive quarter during the calendar year. This quarter we paid approximately $500 million in incentive compensation, which included the normal pay cycle for formal Willis colleagues and a partial year bonus for former Towers Watson's Associates. Additionally, we contributed approximately $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2016. We'll continue to incur various merger and integration-related costs. These costs will continue to be material as we work through the integration period, and we expect them to be in approximately the $150 million to $170 million -- $175 million range for 2016. The level of spending will depend on how quickly we move through some of the integration activities. Both deferred revenues and transaction and integration related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we continued to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low double digits with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. For purposes of segment guidance, we'll use commission -- commissions and fees, which excludes other revenue. As noted previously, a legal settlement of approximately $40 million will be posted to other income in the second quarter. 
As we guide to overall company performance, we'll use total revenues, which includes fees and commissions and other revenues. We continued to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but based on the first quarter results, our expectations are a bit muted versus the beginning of the year. 
Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 20%, an increase from our previous guidance of around 19.5%. In calendar 2015, adjusted operating income was 19.1%. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% and 24% range. The current GAAP rate of approximately 7% is due to a number of factors, but the main driver is related to the valuation of intangibles as a result of purchase accounting.  The amortization of the intangibles is somewhat front end loaded in the current GAAP rate will not be sustained over time. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $7.77 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.43 to GBP 1 and EUR 1.10. While we've maintained our overall revenue growth projections, the first quarter is dampened the range of this growth. Our leadership team is aligned and committed to manage expenses as needed to achieve our 2016 adjusted EPS goal. Once again, we have many moving pieces related to the merger and integration, but I'm extremely pleased with how things are progressing. Our intent is to continue to streamline reporting over the next several quarters and provide a clear line of sight to our operations and results. Now I'll turn it back to John"

And then international, within legacy Willis, and the CWR segment is a little bit softer.

So perhaps you might look at our guidance and be surprised that were not a little bit more muted, but we think that in Asia -- we mentioned, Asia and international, there were some deals that didn't come and in the first quarter, but we've seen them coming later in the year. And also as I mentioned, there were -- in a couple of segments, there were some tougher comparables that don't repeat later in the year. So we think are little bit muted is the way to look at it."

We think there is opportunity there. We think that is clearly a great asset to have as we towards that target and is producing real results. So we do think as you look at some comparables that, there is opportunity to enhance margin, and we're on the case. So I think that's the margin piece. I would say broadly and maybe John wants to comment on this a little bit, relative to our past experience, but when you look at the growth results year versus other peers in the market, first legacy Willis was moving in the last couple of years organically in that 3% to 4% range. There were some headwinds this quarter, some of those were again timing in nature, including the pipeline adjustments that we talked about, which was probably worth about 0.5 growth. So I think you consider the overall merger activity and you look at comparables, and I think -- again, we're confident and improved growth -- organic growth as we go through the year. And while -- again a little bit muted, we think we're in okay place as we start the year."

For this quarter particularly, one thing that we mentioned, that's just briefly in the script that was a little bit stronger than our forecasts and lead to some of the margin enhancements and other and versus what we expected is Gras Savoye stronger in the first quarter that expected. Some of that was just due to some revenue accounting comparability between the 2 firms. So we haven't changed our view on the full year for Gras Savoye and they're coming in nicely, but it did give some acceleration into the first quarter. 
I think otherwise OIP savings are flowing in. I think the team was attentive that you might recall if you follow the both the legacy companies, there was cost activity going on as we entered the merger in both companies, and we're seeing the benefit of that. So I think otherwise there is disciplined operating activity going on. I mean, we did mentioned again -- and it is unfortunate, which is the project cancellation that we mentioned earlier, but when you look at the 2 parts of legacy Willis that were farthest advance in the OIP program, both North America and GB are seeing a benefit now in their margins of OIP.

Can you talk about what sort of you expect your share repurchases to look like? I don't think at this point, you have an authorization, so maybe you could remind me of that? And also if you want to touch upon the free cash flow outlook, I think we were hoping to get a little bit more visibility on that as you think about things with -- not only for this year, but going forward over the next couple of years as those one-time expenses roll off and what you think you are underlying free cash flow power can be in a couple of years?"

So look, when we -- we didn't mean to signal any change from anything we said before. What Roger was saying is, we expect to have a few hundred million dollars available in the second half of the year, which is I think what we have talked about. This formulation that we said that what we want to do is maximize shareholder return. Generally, if we can find a very attractive acquisitions, that's the -- that's probably the way we could do that best, and we would -- we're always looking to do that. But as a practical matter, there is no way we're going to do any kind of really major acquisition in the first year or 1.5 year of this merger we have work to do there. Even a more modest acquisition, if there was something that was a unique property that if we didn't buy it now, there wouldn't be an opportunity to buy 1 like that in the future, we might consider something like that. But in general, we're going to have higher standards for doing any acquisitions. But our overall approach has always been acquisitions are first, but where -- we have some high standards for doing that. So it's hard to find them. And then after that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. I think the -- our free cash flow is going to be the major source of how we can do that, and we're looking to in general, deploy a letter for free cash flow over the coming years to be doing share repurchases. We don't need any kind of a specific authorization from the board. We don't need any new authorization. We have about $500 million authorization that's already exists. And so what ever we would be thinking about doing this year, we're already set for that."

With Willis Towers Watson and the relatively limited overlap we had, we've seen, I think more energy and excitement among colleagues at an early stage than the we ever have before. We are -- we have been looking at our turnover statistics. There is nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, if anything there a little bit lower, then I might have expected. I thing that we expect that, we will see normal turnover. I was prepared for turnover actually, especially maybe last year between announcement and the closing to be a little bit higher than usual. We did not see that. And I think that again goes back to the enthusiasm that our colleagues around the world had for this."

Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide some guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results for this quarter. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the legacy Willis and Towers Watson structure. We anticipate providing consolidated segments results for the second quarter of 2016 during our August earnings call. 
Before we review our first quarter 2016 results, I'd like to say how pleased I am to see the focus and excitement our colleagues have brought to the marketplace, and the collaboration that's taking place at all levels of the organization. I want to thank all of our colleagues for the spirit they've shown to date and all of the hard work that's keeping us on point for achieving our long-term goals. 
We're pleased with how we performed this quarter.  Reported revenues for the quarter were to $2.2 billion, which includes $53 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Despite the currency headwinds, adjusted revenues, which include $32 million of deferred revenues, were up 16% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an organic basis. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues. The prior year first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $579 million or 28.8%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye. Miller and Gras Savoye produced most of their profits in the first half of the calendar year. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $326 million or 15% of revenue. The prior year first quarter pro forma operating income was $369 million or 18%. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues, and for the prior year quarter was $540 million or 26.8% on a pro forma basis.  For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.75, an adjusted diluted earings per share were $3.41. Roger will address the adjusted EPS in more detail later in the call. 
I'd also like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First let's discuss the revenue synergies. 
We recently updated our revenue tracking tools and plan to have more detailed revenue synergy updates by the  third quarter. However, as I travel to the various offices and see first hand the collaborative sales efforts and hear about our market success, it's clear our colleagues are not waiting for a top-down integration mandate or reporting tools to go to market. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 3 global healthcare solution clients and the pipeline looks very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange opportunities, we won 9 new clients for the 2017 enrollment season and continued to see the pipeline build. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we were awarded all the P&C lines for a multibillion-dollar construction organization. 
We're also seeing some success scenarios we didn't fully appreciate prior to the merger. As an example, we were recently awarded the global P&C business for a large multinational based outside of the U.S. The sales team incorporated the knowledge of the company from both legacy organizations so that we could tailor a solution that was in alignment with the client's needs. The client noted that our strong collaboration and the depth of our analytical capabilities set us apart from the competition and help us look at their prevailing interest and the data issues from a very new and different perspective. 
Within just 4 weeks of bringing Willis Towers Watson together, we were able to come together as a single global team and radically change the way the client viewed Willis Towers Watson. 
We also experienced a win recently with a French multinational in an area we have no formal revenue synergy targets. Gras Savoye had a long-standing relationship with this client in healthcare and property and casualty. Joining forces with the Gras Savoye relationship team with a team of Talent and Rewards consultants who were hired for a pay grading project. This is a great example of the full array of services we can now provide our clients. 
While these early wins may not have a significant immediate financial impact, we're very pleased with the progress we've made towards our revenue synergies. These wins are further proof of the strong culture alignment of the merged organizations and perhaps most importantly, these wins demonstrate that when we put client needs first and help them succeed, we will succeed. 
Seeing the overall level of sales activity we've had to date, I'm more confident than ever about our -- achieving our 2018 revenue synergy objectives. 
Now, moving to the cost and tax synergies. We announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually, with these objectives achievable over a 3-year post-merger integration period. We budgeted $20 million in cost synergies for 2016, with an expected run rate of approximately $30 million of annualized savings and fully expect to meet our overall savings objectives by the end of 2018.  We should ultimately exceed our tax goal of $75 million of annual tax savings. 
As a side note, regarding the recently issued treasury roles, our outside advisors and tax group reviewed the treasury regulations thoroughly, and we feel confident these regulations will not impact our current or longer-term tax savings. 
I'd also like to address the legacy Willis Operational Improvement Program or now what we'll refer to as OIP. We continue to see this program as an important factor in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin objective by the end of 2018. We'll continue to provide color on the program and highlight savings, but we'll focus on the margin impact rather than the spread between revenue and expense growth. Incremental savings from the OIT were -- OIP, excuse me, were approximately $94 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. The momentum of continuing savings will be sustained throughout the year. We continue to be committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017.  This quarter, we incurred about $25 million of restructuring cost, and overall, we'll spent approximately $140 million in 2016.  This program continues to be on track to meet all of its financial objectives. 
One significant step taking place this month is the restructuring of mid-and back-office colleagues in Great Britain. As a reminder, much of the program is focused on streamlining processes and moving office and administrative functions to lower cost locations. Great Britain was one of the first regions to adopt the OIP and now entering the last phase of the project. They're on track to attain their saving goals on schedule and on budget. We continue to believe the majority of the company OIP savings will drop to the bottom line, and we're driving internal accountabilities to ensure that happens.  We will have more detailed information on margin impact during our Analyst Day in September. 
Now I'll review the first quarter 2016 legacy Towers Watson segment results and outlook, and Roger will provide the legacy Willis results and provide updated 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. 
As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include amortization, cash incentives and some of the restructuring cost, whereas Towers Watson margin exclude amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition cost and discretionary compensation. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of legacy Towers Watsons segment. 
On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in Benefits increased 1%, Exchange Solutions increased 57%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 4%, and Talent and Rewards decreased 9%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. So let's look at each segment in more depth, starting with Benefits. 
For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $486 million, which represents a 1% increase as compared to a 5% pro forma revenue increase in the first quarter of 2015. Retirement revenues decreased by 2%, Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 8% and Technology and Administration Solutions revenues were up 8%. We don't anticipate any special demand for actuarial consulting services in 2016. Demand is expected to be good for healthcare consulting, and technology and administration is expected to go live with many client implementations throughout the year, which will drive additional revenues.  We expect Benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the low-single-digit range. Benefits had an NOI margin of 36%, and we continue to expect this segment to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016. 
Exchange Solutions had an outstanding quarter, with revenues of $152 million, a pro forma increase of 57%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 48%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchanges revenues increased 47%. And the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 73%, and 49% on an organic basis. Increased enrollments in new client revenues drove the revenue increases. Our consumer-directed accounts practice also contributed approximately $9 million in revenue this quarter.  
We believe the increase in lives will continue to support good growth for the rest of 2016, but we don't expect much off-cycle work during the calendar year. We have increased revenue growth expectations from low to mid-20% to a high 20% range for calendar year '16. 
Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin as compared to 21% in last year's first quarter. The Retiree and Access Exchanges line of business led this segment with a 48% NOI margin. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the high-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year. 
For the quarter, Risk and Financial services had revenues of $144 million, a pro forma decline of 4%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 5% due to a softness in EMEA life consulting and a general softness in demand in the Americas. Investment revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in EMEA as demand softened for advisory services.  The Risk and Financial services segment is expected to have low-single-digit revenue growth for calendar year '16. We recently invested in senior marketing staff and the pipeline appears to be greater than at this point last year. We anticipate the impact of our marketing investments to impact revenues in the second half of the year. In addition, the prior year comparables for investments aren't as tough.  Risk and Financial services had a 23% NOI margin, and we expect to manage the business to achieve mid-20% margins. 
Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $124 million, down 9% on a pro forma constant currency basis and down 6% on a pro forma organic basis, as compared to the prior year quarter, which experienced 15% revenue growth. 
Executive Compensation revenues were down 1% as compared to 11% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Data, surveys and technology revenues decreased by 15%. We saw a 4% decline on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 9% revenue growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. As a reminder, we acquired Saville Consulting and sold our HR Service Delivery business. 
Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased 9% as compared to 23% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Talent and Rewards had a 10% NOI margin for the quarter. The first half of the calendar year is generally soft for this segment. We see an overall decrease in the number of transactions in the market globally, and as a result, we anticipate this impacting the segment's topline results, given that we're lowering our revenue outlook from a mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth to a low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with margins in the mid-20% range. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger"
36623,331460633,975851,"Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone.

I'd like to first reiterate John's comment on the great collaboration we're experiencing in Willis Towers Watson. The level of engagement I've seen from the operating committee members to colleagues around the globe has been tremendous. It really is an exciting time to be part of Willis Towers Watson and based on the foundation being created now, I look forward to a very successful future. 
Before moving to the performance of the legacy Willis segments, I'd like to add more color on John's comments regarding the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I'd also like to discuss a couple of noteworthy adjustments to earnings which were highlighted in the press release today. 
There were 2 significant positive impacts to adjusted diluted earnings per share: First, our adjusted tax rate came in at 19%, which was lower than our forecast. Due to the seasonal strength of our profitability this quarter, we expect higher tax rates in the coming quarters, particularly in those quarters with seasonally lower operating profit. 
Second, our outstanding weighted average diluted share count came in lower-than-expected due to the merger closing 4 days into the quarter. This lowered our average diluted share count to approximately $136 million. The current outstanding diluted shares are approximately $138 million. 
Now let me turn to the reconciliation of segment operating income to income from operations, which was highlighted in our press release this morning. Most of these adjustments are self-explanatory, but I thought there were 2 items which perhaps needed some additional explanation. 
First, amortization of $126 million represents the intangibles amortization which is excluded from the legacy Towers Watson segment results. In addition to this, there is $35 million of amortization expense reported in the legacy Willis segment results. The reporting treatment will be uniform next quarter when we report on the consolidated Willis Towers Watson segments. 
Second, as we've described in public filings, relevant parties have agreed in principle to settle the Stanford litigation for $120 million and seek of court issued bar order against all Stanford-related claims. We recorded a $70 million provision in the December quarter based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The balance of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter once the settlement amount and terms were agreed.  The settlement will need final court approval, which if granted, may take several quarters. This is still ongoing litigation, so we're not able to provide more detail beyond what we've already said in our public filings. 
Now let me turn to the legacy Willis segment performance. 
On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees, or C&F, for international increased by 84%; North America increased 3%; capital, wholesale and reinsurance increased by 14%; and Great Britain was flat. All of the C&F results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each of the legacy Willis segments in more depth. 
Turning to Willis International. With the consolidation of Gras Savoye, which contributed $235 million to revenue in the quarter, the top line grew 84% from the prior year. Gras Savoye contribution for the quarter was bit ahead of plan. On an organic basis, international C&F declined by 5%. This was driven by weakness in Asia and a cancellation adjustment for a large natural resources project. This cancellation was not related to the economic environment of the energy sector, but was political in nature. 
We continued to see strong growth in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The segment's operating profit margin was 30% this quarter. Our outlook for organic C&F growth for the full year is in the mid-single-digit range with net operating margin in the low- to mid-teens range. 
Willis North America had a nice start to the year with organic C&F growth of 4%. The segment saw strength in all of it's core regions across a number of lines of business, most notably construction, financial institutions and FINEX despite modest pricing headwinds. The Human Capital Practice also contributed mid-single-digit organic growth during the quarter. The segment's operating margin of 23% was modestly ahead of our expectations and highlights some of the strategic changes we've been making related to the Operational Improvement Program. 
The outlook for Willis North America organic C&F growth continues to be in the low- to mid-single digits with a margin in the high teens. 
Now turning to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CW&R generated commissions and fees growth of 14%, driven primarily by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services which contributed $49 million of C&F in the quarter. Organic C&F declined 3%, primarily due to the year-over-year decline of our fine arts and jewelry business as a result of the departure of the team of associates to JLT, For which we recently settled litigation, as well as a strong comparable in reinsurance business, which benefited last year by an uplift of $6.5 million on a restructured account. 
CWR's operating margin was 46% as this segments business is seasonally rated -- weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect reported growth to be in the low double digits as Miller fully rolls through -- fully rolls on through the first half of the year. Organic C&F growth is expected to be in the low-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we don't see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates.  I should note that in our growth guidance for CWR on a commission and fees basis, is lower than the total revenues guidance we provided previously. This results from the fact that the earlier guidance included the anticipated impact of the $40 million settlement with JLT, which will be recognized in the second quarter as other income in total revenues. This item will not be adjusted out of GAAP earnings, consistent with the historic practice. We expect operating margin to be in the low-20% range. 
Finally, Willis GB C&F growth was flat for the quarter. The cancellation adjustment for the large natural resources project mentioned earlier also impacted Willis GB. Organic C&F declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the natural resources project, organic growth would have been up approximately 2%. The segment's reported operating margin was 14%, modestly lower as compared to the prior year, driven by the project-related revenue decline and some one-time expense adjustments. 
We continue to have a positive outlook for the business, and these one-time revenue and expense events which occurred this quarter are not indicative of our future outlook. Our outlook for organic C&F growth is in the low-single-digit range with margin in the high-20% range. 
Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. We issued a $1 billion of U.S. dollar notes in March $450 million at 3.5%, with a maturity date of September 2021 and $550 million at 4.4% with a maturity date of March 26. We expect to go to the euro market for an additional $600 million to $800 million. Being in the market recently and finalizing the timing of our refinancing, we expect our interest charges to be approximately $200 million for the year 2016.  The proceeds from the dollar offering were used to repay our $300 million public note, which matured in March, repay the USD 400 million tranche of our 1 year banknote and reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. 
Let me turn now to capital allocation. 
As we mentioned, during the last earnings call, we expect to have a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility, while maintaining an investment grade-rated balance sheet. On a Moody's basis, this equates to a threshold of approximately 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Currently, our Moody's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 3.7. We expect this to self-correct over the next several quarters as our restructuring expenses decline, merger-related cost reduction programs are implemented and profits increase. 
We believe we have several hundred million dollars of capital allocation flexibility for the second half of the year. As always, we'll weigh the benefit of potential acquisitions versus repurchasing shares. We prefer to do good acquisitions, and after that, look to share buybacks, consistent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. 
Free cash flow was $70 million this quarter. Free cash flow is expected to generally improve through each consecutive quarter during the calendar year. This quarter we paid approximately $500 million in incentive compensation, which included the normal pay cycle for former Willis colleagues and a partial year bonus for former Towers Watson's Associates. Additionally, we contributed approximately $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2016. We'll continue to incur various merger and integration-related costs. These costs will continue to be material as we work through the integration period, and we expect them to be in approximately the $150 million to $170 million -- I'm sorry, $175 million range for 2016. The level of spending will depend on how quickly we move through some of the integration activities. Both deferred revenues and transaction and integration related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low-double digits, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. For purposes of segment guidance, we'll use commission -- commissions and fees, which excludes other revenue. As noted previously, a legal settlement of approximately $40 million will be posted to other income in the second quarter. 
As we guide to overall company performance, we'll use total revenues, which includes fees and commissions and other revenues. We continue to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but based on the first quarter results, our expectations are a bit muted versus the beginning of the year. 
Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 20%, an increase from our previous guidance of around 19.5%. In calendar 2015, adjusted operating income was 19.1%. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. The current GAAP rate of approximately 7% is due to a number of factors, but the main driver is related to the valuation of intangibles as a result of purchase accounting.  The amortization of the intangibles is somewhat front-end loaded and the current GAAP rate will not be sustained over time. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.43 to the pound and $1.10 to the euro. While we've maintained our overall revenue growth projections, the first quarter has dampened the range of this growth. Our leadership team is aligned and committed to manage expenses as needed to achieve our 2016 adjusted EPS goal. 
Once again, we have many moving pieces related to the merger and integration, but I'm extremely pleased with how things are progressing. Our intent is to continue to streamline reporting over the next several quarters and provide a clear line of sight to our operations and results. Now I'll turn it back to John."

As we mentioned, the Talent and Rewards business came in  softer than we expected, and we're not seeing the kind of project activity that we saw there last year. And then international, within legacy Willis and the CWR segment, is a little bit softer. So I think those are all the areas that were a little bit off where we expected. We do think that some of the elements there are timing in nature. So perhaps, you might look at our guidance and be surprised that we're not a little bit more muted. But we think that in Asia, we've mentioned Asia and international, there were some deals that didn't come in, in the first quarter, but we seen them coming in later in the year. And also as I mentioned, there were -- in a couple of segments, there were some tougher comparables that don't repeat later in the year. So we think a little bit muted is the way to look at it."

In margins, when I look at peers, margins are in the mid-20s, organic growth has been running 3%, 4% here recently. So your organic was negative adjusting for items or flattish. Margins, sound like you're kind of -- if we take the international and North America in the aggregate, looks like you're looking at mid-teens margins. Why is that? Because I would guess, obviously, those margins that you're talking about are excluding the Operational Improvement Program and other adjustments. What is that delta?

We think there's opportunity there. We think that OIP is clearly a great asset to have as we move towards that target and is producing real results. So we do think, as you look at some comparables, that there's opportunity to enhance margin, and we're on the case. So I think that's the margin piece. I would say broadly, and maybe John wants to comment on this a little bit, relative to our past experience, but when you look at the growth results here versus other players in the market, first, legacy Willis was moving the last couple of years organically in that 3% to 4% range. There were some headwinds this quarter. Some of those were, again, timing in nature, including the pipeline adjustments that we talked about, which was probably worth about 0.5 point of growth. So I think you consider the overall merger activity and you look at comparables, and I think -- again, we're confident in improved growth -- organic growth as we go through the year, and while, again, a little bit muted, we think we're in okay place there as we start the year."

I mean, I think, again, the trajectory that we expect from an EBITDA margin point of view, and I won't say necessarily every quarter. But given our focus, we expect gradually improving EBITDA margins. For this quarter particularly, one thing that we mentioned just briefly in the script that was a little bit stronger than our forecast and lead to some of the margin enhancement, again, versus what we expected is Gras Savoye came in stronger in the first quarter than expected. Some of that was just due to some revenue accounting comparability between the 2 firms. So we haven't changed our view on the full year for Gras Savoye, and they're coming in nicely, but it did give some acceleration into the first quarter.  I think otherwise, OIP savings are flowing in. I think the team was attentive. And you might recall, if you followed both the legacy companies, that there was cost activity going on as we entered the merger in both companies, and we're seeing a benefit of that. So I think, otherwise, there's disciplined operating activity going on. I mean, we did mention again -- and it is unfortunate with the project cancellation that we mentioned earlier, but when you look at the 2 parts of legacy Willis that were farthest advanced in the OIP program, both North America and GB are seeing a benefit now in their margins of OIP. Unfortunately, in GB, because of the cancellation, it's not as visible as it otherwise would have been."

So look, when we -- we didn't mean to signal any change from anything we said before. What Roger was saying is we expect to have a few hundred million dollars available in the second half of the year, which is I think always what we had talked about. This formulation that we said that what we want to do is maximize shareholder return. Generally, if we can find very a attractive acquisition, that's the -- that's probably the way we could do that best, and we would -- we're always looking to do that. But as a practical matter, there's no way we're going to do any kind of really major acquisition in the first year or 1.5 year of this merger. We have work to do there, even a more modest acquisition. If there was something that was a unique property, that if we didn't buy it now, there wouldn't be an opportunity to buy one like that in the future, we might consider something like that. But in general, we're going to have higher standards for doing any acquisitions. But our overall approach has always been acquisitions are first, but where -- we have some high standards for doing that, so it's hard to find them. And then after that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. I think the -- our free cash flow is going to be the major source of how we can do that, and we're looking to, in general, deploy a lot of our free cash flow over the coming years to be doing share repurchases. We don't need any kind of a specific authorization from the board. We don't need any new authorization. We have about $500 million authorization that already exists.

With Willis Towers Watson and the relatively limited overlap we had, we've seen, I think more energy and excitement among colleagues at an earlier stage than we ever have before. We are -- we have been looking at our turnover statistics. There's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, if anything, they're a little bit lower that I might have expected. I think that we expect that we'll see normal turnover -- I was prepared for turnover actually, especially maybe last year between announcement and the closing to be a little bit higher than usual.

Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide some guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results for this quarter. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the legacy Willis and Towers Watson structure. We anticipate providing consolidated segment results for the second quarter of 2016 during our August earnings call. 
Before we review our first quarter 2016 results, I'd like to say how pleased I am to see the focus and excitement our colleagues have brought to the marketplace, and the collaboration that's taking place at all levels of the organization. I want to thank all of our colleagues for the spirit they've shown to date and all of the hard work that's keeping us on point for achieving our long-term goals. 
We're pleased with how we performed this quarter.  Reported revenues for the quarter were to $2.2 billion, which includes $53 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Despite the currency headwinds, adjusted revenues, which include $32 million of deferred revenues, were up 16% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an organic basis. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues. The prior year first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $579 million or 28.8%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye. Miller and Gras Savoye produced most of their profits in the first half of the calendar year. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $326 million or 15% of revenue. The prior year first quarter pro forma operating income was $369 million or 18%. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues, and for the prior year quarter was $540 million or 26.8% on a pro forma basis.  For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.75, and adjusted diluted earings per share were $3.41. Roger will address the adjusted EPS in more detail later in the call. 
I'd also like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First let's discuss the revenue synergies. 
We recently updated our revenue tracking tools and plan to have more detailed revenue synergy updates by the third quarter. However, as I travel to the various offices and see first hand the collaborative sales efforts and hear about our market success, it's clear our colleagues are not waiting for a top-down integration mandate or reporting tools to go to market. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 3 global healthcare solution clients and the pipeline looks very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange opportunities, we won 9 new clients for the 2017 enrollment season and continued to see the pipeline build. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we were awarded all the P&C lines for a multibillion-dollar construction organization. 
We're also seeing some success scenarios we didn't fully appreciate prior to the merger. As an example, we were recently awarded the global P&C business for a large multinational based outside of the U.S. The sales team incorporated the knowledge of the company from both legacy organizations so that we could tailor a solution that was in alignment with the client's needs. The client noted that our strong collaboration and the depth of our analytical capabilities set us apart from the competition and help us look at their prevailing risk and data issues from a very new and different perspective. 
Within just 4 weeks of bringing Willis Towers Watson together, we were able to come together as a single global team and radically change the way the client viewed Willis Towers Watson. 
We also experienced a win recently with a French multinational in an area we have no formal revenue synergy targets. Gras Savoye had a long-standing relationship with this client in healthcare and property and casualty. Joining forces with the Gras Savoye relationship team was a team of Talent and Reward consultants who were hired for a pay grading project. This is a great example of the full array of services we can now provide our clients. 
While these early wins may not have a significant immediate financial impact, we're very pleased with the progress we've made towards our revenue synergies. These wins are further proof of the strong culture alignment of the merged organizations and perhaps most importantly, these wins demonstrate that when we put client needs first and help them succeed, we will succeed. 
Seeing the overall level of sales activity we've had to date, I'm more confident than ever about achieving our 2018 revenue synergy objectives. 
Now, moving to the cost and tax synergies. We announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually, with these objectives achievable over a 3-year post-merger integration period. We budgeted $20 million in cost synergies for 2016, with an expected run rate of approximately $30 million of annualized savings and fully expect to meet our overall savings objectives by the end of 2018.  We should ultimately exceed our tax goal of $75 million of annual tax savings. 
As a side note, regarding the recently issued treasury roles, our outside advisors and tax group reviewed the treasury regulations thoroughly, and we feel confident these regulations will not impact our current or longer-term tax savings. 
I'd also like to address the legacy Willis Operational Improvement Program or now what we'll refer to as OIP. We continue to see this program as an important factor in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin objective by the end of 2018. We'll continue to provide color on the program and highlight savings, but we'll focus on the margin impact rather than the spread between revenue and expense growth. Incremental savings from the OIT were -- OIP, excuse me, were approximately $94 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. The momentum of continuing savings will be sustained throughout the year. We continue to be committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017.  This quarter, we incurred about $25 million of restructuring cost, and overall, we'll spend approximately $140 million in 2016.  This program continues to be on track to meet all of its financial objectives. 
One significant step taking place this month is the restructuring of mid-and back-office colleagues in Great Britain. As a reminder, much of the program is focused on streamlining processes and moving office and administrative functions to lower cost locations. Great Britain was one of the first regions to adopt the OIP and now entering the last phase of the project. They're on track to attain their saving goals on schedule and on budget. We continue to believe the majority of the company OIP savings will drop to the bottom line, and we're driving internal accountabilities to ensure that happens.  We will have more detailed information on margin impact during our Analyst Day in September. 
Now I'll review the first quarter 2016 legacy Towers Watson segment results and outlook, and Roger will provide the legacy Willis results and provide updated 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. 
As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include amortization, cash incentives and some of the restructuring cost, whereas Towers Watson margins exclude amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition cost and discretionary compensation. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of legacy Towers Watson segments. 
On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in Benefits increased 1%, Exchange Solutions increased 57%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 4%, and Talent and Rewards decreased 9%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. So let's look at each segment in more depth, starting with Benefits. 
For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $486 million, which represents a 1% increase as compared to a 5% pro forma revenue increase in the first quarter of 2015. Retirement revenues decreased by 2%, Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 8%,  and Technology and Administration Solutions revenues were up 8%. We don't anticipate any special demand for actuarial consulting services in 2016. Demand is expected to be good for healthcare consulting, and technology and administration is expected to go live with many client implementations throughout the year, which will drive additional revenues.  We expect Benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the low-single-digit range. Benefits had an NOI margin of 36%, and we continue to expect this segment to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016. 
Exchange Solutions had an outstanding quarter, with revenues of $152 million, a pro forma increase of 57%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 48%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 47%. And the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 73%, and 49% on an organic basis. Increased enrollments in new client revenues drove the revenue increases. Our consumer-directed accounts practice also contributed approximately $9 million in revenue this quarter.  
We believe the increase in lives will continue to support good growth for the rest of 2016, but we don't expect much off-cycle work during the calendar year. We have increased revenue growth expectations from low to mid-20% to a high 20% range for calendar year '16. 
Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin as compared to 21% in last year's first quarter. The Retiree and Access Exchanges line of business led this segment with a 48% NOI margin. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the high-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year. 
For the quarter, Risk and Financial services had revenues of $144 million, a pro forma decline of 4%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 5% due to a softness in EMEA life consulting and a general softness in demand in the Americas. Investment revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in EMEA as demand softened for advisory services.  The Risk and Financial services segment is expected to have low-single-digit revenue growth for calendar year '16. We recently invested in senior marketing staff and the pipeline appears to be greater than at this point last year. We anticipate the impact of our marketing investments to impact revenues in the second half of the year. In addition, the prior year comparables for investments aren't as tough.  Risk and Financial services had a 23% NOI margin, and we expect to manage the business to achieve mid-20% margins. 
Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $124 million, down 9% on a pro forma constant currency basis and down 6% on a pro forma organic basis, as compared to the prior year quarter, which experienced 15% revenue growth. 
Executive Compensation revenues were down 1% as compared to 11% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Data, surveys and technology revenues decreased by 15%. We saw a 4% decline on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 9% revenue growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. As a reminder, we acquired Saville Consulting and sold our HR Service Delivery business. 
Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased 9% as compared to 23% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Talent and Rewards had a 10% NOI margin for the quarter. The first half of the calendar year is generally soft for this segment. We see an overall decrease in the number of transactions in the market globally, and as a result, we anticipate this impacting the segment's topline results, given that we're lowering our revenue outlook from a mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth to a low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with margins in the mid-20% range. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'd like to first reiterate John's comment on the great collaboration we're experiencing in Willis Towers Watson. The level of engagement I've seen from the operating committee members to colleagues around the globe has been tremendous. It really is an exciting time to be part of Willis Towers Watson and based on the foundation being created now, I look forward to a very successful future. 
Before moving to the performance of the legacy Willis segments, I'd like to add more color on John's comments regarding the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I'd also like to discuss a couple of noteworthy adjustments to earnings which were highlighted in the press release today. 
There were 2 significant positive impacts to adjusted diluted earnings per share: First, our adjusted tax rate came in at 19%, which was lower than our forecast. Due to the seasonal strength of our profitability this quarter, we expect higher tax rates in the coming quarters, particularly in those quarters with seasonally lower operating profit. 
Second, our outstanding weighted average diluted share count came in lower-than-expected due to the merger closing 4 days into the quarter. This lowered our average diluted share count to approximately $136 million. The current outstanding diluted shares are approximately $138 million. 
Now let me turn to the reconciliation of segment operating income to income from operations, which was highlighted in our press release this morning. Most of these adjustments are self-explanatory, but I thought there were 2 items which perhaps needed some additional explanation. 
First, amortization of $126 million represents the intangibles amortization which is excluded from the legacy Towers Watson segment results. In addition to this, there is $35 million of amortization expense reported in the legacy Willis segment results. The reporting treatment will be uniform next quarter when we report on the consolidated Willis Towers Watson segments. 
Second, as we've described in public filings, relevant parties have agreed in principle to settle the Stanford litigation for $120 million and seek a court issued bar order against all Stanford-related claims. We recorded a $70 million provision in the December quarter based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The balance of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter once the settlement amount and terms were agreed.  The settlement will need final court approval, which if granted, may take several quarters. This is still ongoing litigation, so we're not able to provide more detail beyond what we've already said in our public filings. 
Now let me turn to the legacy Willis segment performance. 
On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees, or C&F, for international increased by 84%; North America increased 3%; capital, wholesale and reinsurance increased by 14%; and Great Britain was flat. All of the C&F results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each of the legacy Willis segments in more depth. 
Turning to Willis International. With the consolidation of Gras Savoye, which contributed $235 million to revenue in the quarter, the top line grew 84% from the prior year. Gras Savoye's contribution for the quarter was bit ahead of plan. On an organic basis, international C&F declined by 5%. This was driven by weakness in Asia and a cancellation adjustment for a large natural resources project. This cancellation was not related to the economic environment of the energy sector, but was political in nature. 
We continued to see strong growth in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The segment's operating profit margin was 30% this quarter. Our outlook for organic C&F growth for the full year is in the mid-single-digit range with net operating margin in the low- to mid-teens range. 
Willis North America had a nice start to the year with organic C&F growth of 4%. The segment saw strength in all of its core regions across a number of lines of business, most notably construction, financial institutions and FINEX despite modest pricing headwinds. The Human Capital Practice also contributed mid-single-digit organic growth during the quarter. The segment's operating margin of 23% was modestly ahead of our expectations and highlights some of the strategic changes we've been making related to the Operational Improvement Program. 
The outlook for Willis North America organic C&F growth continues to be in the low- to mid-single digits with a margin in the high teens. 
Now turning to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CWR generated commissions and fees growth of 14%, driven primarily by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services which contributed $49 million of C&F in the quarter. Organic C&F declined 3%, primarily due to the year-over-year decline of our fine arts and jewelry business as a result of the departure of the team of associates to JLT, for which we recently settled litigation, as well as a strong comparable in the reinsurance business, which benefited last year by an uplift of $6.5 million on a restructured account. 
CWR's operating margin was 46% as this segment' business is seasonally weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect reported growth to be in the low double digits as Miller fully rolls on through the first half of the year. Organic C&F growth is expected to be in the low-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we don't see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates.  I should note that in our growth guidance for CWR on a commission and fees basis, is lower than the total revenues guidance we provided previously. This results from the fact that the earlier guidance included the anticipated impact of the $40 million settlement with JLT, which will be recognized in the second quarter as other income in total revenues. This item will not be adjusted out of GAAP earnings, consistent with the historic practice. We expect operating margin to be in the low-20% range. 
Finally, Willis GB C&F growth was flat for the quarter. The cancellation adjustment for the large natural resources project mentioned earlier also impacted Willis GB. Organic C&F declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the natural resources project, organic growth would have been up approximately 2%. The segment's reported operating margin was 14%, modestly lower as compared to the prior year, driven by the project-related revenue decline and some one-time expense adjustments. 
We continue to have a positive outlook for the business, and these one-time revenue and expense events which occurred this quarter are not indicative of our future outlook. Our outlook for organic C&F growth is in the low-single-digit range with margin in the high-20% range. 
Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. We issued a $1 billion of U.S. dollar notes in March, $450 million at 3.5%, with a maturity date of September 2021 and $550 million at 4.4% with a maturity date of March 26. We expect to go to the euro market for an additional $600 million to $800 million. Being in the market recently and finalizing the timing of our refinancing, we expect our interest charges to be approximately $200 million for the year 2016.  The proceeds from the dollar offering were used to repay our $300 million public note, which matured in March, repay the USD 400 million tranche of our one year banknote and reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. 
Let me turn now to capital allocation. 
As we mentioned, during the last earnings call, we expect to have a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility, while maintaining an investment grade-rated balance sheet. On a Moody's basis, this equates to a threshold of approximately 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Currently, our Moody's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 3.7. We expect this to self-correct over the next several quarters as our restructuring expenses decline, merger-related cost reduction programs are implemented and profits increase. 
We believe we have several hundred million dollars of capital allocation flexibility for the second half of the year. As always, we'll weigh the benefit of potential acquisitions versus repurchasing shares. We prefer to do good acquisitions, and after that, look to share buybacks, consistent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. 
Free cash flow was $70 million this quarter. Free cash flow is expected to generally improve through each consecutive quarter during the calendar year. This quarter we paid approximately $500 million in incentive compensation, which included the normal pay cycle for former Willis colleagues and a partial year bonus for former Towers Watson Associates. Additionally, we contributed approximately $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2016. We'll continue to incur various merger and integration-related costs. These costs will continue to be material as we work through the integration period, and we expect them to be in approximately the $150 million to $170 million -- I'm sorry, $175 million range for 2016. The level of spending will depend on how quickly we move through some of the integration activities. Both deferred revenues and transaction and integration related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low-double digits, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. For purposes of segment guidance, we'll use commissions and fees, which excludes other revenue. As noted previously, a legal settlement of approximately $40 million will be posted to other income in the second quarter. 
As we guide to overall company performance, we'll use total revenues, which includes fees and commissions and other revenues. We continue to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but based on the first quarter results, our expectations are a bit muted versus the beginning of the year. 
Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 20%, an increase from our previous guidance of around 19.5%. In calendar 2015, adjusted operating income was 19.1%. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. The current GAAP rate of approximately 7% is due to a number of factors, but the main driver is related to the valuation of intangibles as a result of purchase accounting.  The amortization of the intangibles is somewhat front-end loaded and the current GAAP rate will not be sustained over time. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.43 to the pound and $1.10 to the euro. While we've maintained our overall revenue growth projections, the first quarter has dampened the range of this growth. Our leadership team is aligned and committed to manage expenses as needed to achieve our 2016 adjusted EPS goal. 
Once again, we have many moving pieces related to the merger and integration, but I'm extremely pleased with how things are progressing. Our intent is to continue to streamline reporting over the next several quarters and provide a clear line of sight to our operations and results. Now I'll turn it back to John."

And I think the legacy Towers Watson RFS segment is one of those pieces. As we mentioned, the Talent and Rewards business came in softer than we expected, and we're not seeing the kind of project activity that we saw there last year. And then international, within legacy Willis and the CWR segment, is a little bit softer. So I think those are all the areas that were a little bit off where we expected. We do think that some of the elements there are timing in nature. So perhaps, you might look at our guidance and be surprised that we're not a little bit more muted. But we think that in Asia, we've mentioned Asia and international, there were some deals that didn't come in, in the first quarter, but we've seen them coming in later in the year. And also as I mentioned, there were -- in a couple of segments, there were some tougher comparables that don't repeat later in the year. So we think a little bit muted is the way to look at it."

Look, I think this goes back to the overall merger strategy and set up and what we're implementing. I can't really comment on the margin gap that you just articulated, but it doesn't sound all that dissimilar to what we were thinking about when we set the 25% EBITDA margin target for the overall company. We think there's opportunity there. We think that OIP is clearly a great asset to have as we move towards that target and is producing real results. So we do think, as you look at some comparables, that there's opportunity to enhance margin, and we're on the case. So I think that's the margin piece. I would say broadly, and maybe John wants to comment on this a little bit, relative to our past experience, but when you look at the growth results here versus other players in the market, first, legacy Willis was moving the last couple of years organically in that 3% to 4% range. There were some headwinds this quarter. Some of those were, again, timing in nature, including the pipeline adjustments that we talked about, which was probably worth about 0.5 point of growth. So I think you consider the overall merger activity and you look at comparables, and I think -- again, we're confident in improved growth -- organic growth as we go through the year, and while, again, a little bit muted, we think we're in an okay place here as we start the year."

I think the important thing from my viewpoint, though, is how quickly we're starting to at least see some of them come in, and it's very encouraging for the long-term trend. I think -- so it was really a confluence of different things, but on Exchange Solutions, we're delighted with just the growth in the retirees, in the actives and really across the board there."

We think that investment will do better the rest of the year than it did in the first quarter, just based on the pipeline that we see. One of the things that I think we alluded to, we haven't really discussed in the Q&A here, is the impact in Talent and Rewards of the sale of the Human Resource Service Delivery business. So we'll lap that at some point this year. Talent Rewards, I think the headline numbers make it look worse this quarter than it really is. And I guess, John said, there are some tough comparables from projects they had going on at this time last year that won't repeat. And then you do have, again some of the timing things we mentioned before. So I think again we've gone through each of the business lines, looked at them closely and we do think that this kind of muted view of mid-single-digit organic growth is really what our momentum reflects at this point."

I mean, I think, again, the trajectory that we expect from an EBITDA margin point of view, and I won't say necessarily every quarter. But given our focus, we expect gradually improving EBITDA margins. For this quarter particularly, one thing that we mentioned just briefly in the script that was a little bit stronger than our forecast and led to some of the margin enhancement, again, versus what we expected is Gras Savoye came in stronger in the first quarter than expected. Some of that was just due to some revenue accounting comparability between the 2 firms. So we haven't changed our view on the full year for Gras Savoye, and they're coming in nicely, but it did give some acceleration into the first quarter.  I think otherwise, OIP savings are flowing in. I think the team was attentive. And you might recall, if you followed both the legacy companies, there was cost activity going on as we entered the merger in both companies, and we're seeing a benefit of that. So I think, otherwise, there's disciplined operating activity going on. I mean, we did mention again -- and it is unfortunate with the project cancellation that we mentioned earlier, but when you look at the 2 parts of legacy Willis that were farthest advanced in the OIP program, both North America and GB are seeing a benefit now in their margins of OIP. Unfortunately, in GB, because of the cancellation, it's not as visible as it otherwise would have been."

And are you sticking to sort of the gross savings target that was originally out there, I think it was $150 million for this year? If that's the holding, can you tell us what you expect the net savings to be? Because I think, thus far, sort of on the legacy Willis side, we've seen the gross savings some, but a lot of it was being put back in.

I know there was sort of a commitment to start to repurchase shares in the second half of this year. It sounds like maybe you're a little bit more balanced of keeping some dry powder for M&A. Can you talk about what sort of you expect your share repurchases to look like? I don't think at this point, you have an authorization, so maybe you could remind me about that. And also, if you want to touch upon the free cash flow outlook, I think we were hoping to get a little bit more visibility on that as you think about things not only for this year, but going forward over the next couple of years as those one-time expenses roll off and what you think your underlying free cash flow power can be in a couple of years?"

So look, when we -- we didn't mean to signal any change from anything we said before. What Roger was saying is we expect to have a few hundred million dollars available in the second half of the year, which is I think always what we had talked about. This formulation that we said that what we want to do is maximize shareholder return. Generally, if we can find a very attractive acquisition, that's probably the way we could do that best, and we're always looking to do that. But as a practical matter, there's no way we're going to do any kind of really major acquisition in the first year or 1.5 year of this merger. We have work to do there, even a more modest acquisition. If there was something that was a unique property, that if we didn't buy it now, there wouldn't be an opportunity to buy one like that in the future, we might consider something like that. But in general, we're going to have higher standards for doing any acquisitions. But our overall approach has always been acquisitions are first, but we have some high standards for doing that, so it's hard to find them. And then after that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. I think our free cash flow is going to be the major source of how we can do that, and we're looking to, in general, deploy a lot of our free cash flow over the coming years to be doing share repurchases. We don't need any kind of a specific authorization from the board. We don't need any new authorization. We have about $500 million authorization that already exists. And so whatever we would be thinking about doing this year, we're already set for that."

And I think unlike some other mergers I've been involved in, in the past where you're buying firms where there's lot of overlap, sometimes there's angst among folks as to what their position is going to be in the new organization. With Willis Towers Watson and the relatively limited overlap we had, we've seen, I think more energy and excitement among colleagues at an earlier stage than we ever have before. We have been looking at our turnover statistics. There's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, if anything, they're a little bit lower than I might have expected. I think that we expect that we'll see normal turnover -- I was prepared for turnover actually, especially maybe last year between announcement and the closing to be a little bit higher than usual. We did not see that. And I think that, again, goes back to the enthusiasm that our colleagues around the world have had for this."

We see basically some cons and some pros. The London insurance market could see some premium declines accelerate. The insurance centers could move elsewhere. On the other hand, there is added complexity in the marketplaces, in general, something that's good for consulting firms and for brokers. There would be issues around if people did move legal entities or capital or staffing, that would create opportunities for us, in particular, could benefit CRB and HCB . So I think there would clearly be some short-term dislocations.

Before we review our first quarter 2016 results, I'd like to say how pleased I am to see the focus and excitement our colleagues have brought to the marketplace, and the collaboration that's taking place at all levels of the organization. I want to thank all of our colleagues for the spirit they've shown to date and all of the hard work that's keeping us on point for achieving our long-term goals. 
We're pleased with how we performed this quarter.  Reported revenues for the quarter were to $2.2 billion, which includes $53 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Despite the currency headwinds, adjusted revenues, which include $32 million of deferred revenues, were up 16% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an organic basis. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues. The prior year first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $579 million or 28.8%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye. Miller and Gras Savoye produced most of their profits in the first half of the calendar year. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $326 million or 15% of revenue. The prior year first quarter pro forma operating income was $369 million or 18%. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues, and for the prior year quarter was $540 million or 26.8% on a pro forma basis.  For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.75, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.41. Roger will address the adjusted EPS in more detail later in the call. 
I'd also like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First let's discuss the revenue synergies. 
We recently updated our revenue tracking tools and plan to have more detailed revenue synergy updates by the third quarter. However, as I travel to the various offices and see first hand the collaborative sales efforts and hear about our market success, it's clear our colleagues are not waiting for a top-down integration mandate or reporting tools to go to market. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 3 global healthcare solution clients and the pipeline looks very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange opportunities, we won 9 new clients for the 2017 enrollment season and continued to see the pipeline build. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we were awarded all the P&C lines for a multibillion-dollar construction organization. 
We're also seeing some success scenarios we didn't fully appreciate prior to the merger. As an example, we were recently awarded the global P&C business for a large multinational based outside of the U.S. The sales team incorporated the knowledge of the company from both legacy organizations so that we could tailor a solution that was in alignment with the client's needs. The client noted that our strong collaboration and the depth of our analytical capabilities set us apart from the competition and help us look at their prevailing risk and data issues from a very new and different perspective. 
Within just 4 weeks of bringing Willis Towers Watson together, we were able to come together as a single global team and radically change the way the client viewed Willis Towers Watson. 
We also experienced a win recently with a French multinational in an area we have no formal revenue synergy targets. Gras Savoye had a long-standing relationship with this client in healthcare and property and casualty. Joining forces with the Gras Savoye relationship team was a team of Talent and Reward consultants who were hired for a pay grading project. This is a great example of the full array of services we can now provide our clients. 
While these early wins may not have a significant immediate financial impact, we're very pleased with the progress we've made towards our revenue synergies. These wins are further proof of the strong culture alignment of the merged organizations and perhaps most importantly, these wins demonstrate that when we put client needs first and help them succeed, we will succeed. 
Seeing the overall level of sales activity we've had to date, I'm more confident than ever about achieving our 2018 revenue synergy objectives. 
Now, moving to the cost and tax synergies. We announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually, with these objectives achievable over a 3-year post-merger integration period. We budgeted $20 million in cost synergies for 2016, with an expected run rate of approximately $30 million of annualized savings and fully expect to meet our overall savings objectives by the end of 2018.  We should ultimately exceed our tax goal of $75 million of annual tax savings. 
As a side note, regarding the recently issued treasury roles, our outside advisors and tax group reviewed the treasury regulations thoroughly, and we feel confident these regulations will not impact our current or longer-term tax savings. 
I'd also like to address the legacy Willis Operational Improvement Program or now what we'll refer to as OIP. We continue to see this program as an important factor in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin objective by the end of 2018. We'll continue to provide color on the program and highlight savings, but we'll focus on the margin impact rather than the spread between revenue and expense growth. Incremental savings from the OIT were -- OIP, excuse me, were approximately $94 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. The momentum of continuing savings will be sustained throughout the year. We continue to be committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017.  This quarter, we incurred about $25 million of restructuring cost, and overall, we'll spend approximately $140 million in 2016.  This program continues to be on track to meet all of its financial objectives. 
One significant step taking place this month is the restructuring of mid-and back-office colleagues in Great Britain. As a reminder, much of the program is focused on streamlining processes and moving office and administrative functions to lower cost locations. Great Britain was one of the first regions to adopt the OIP and now entering the last phase of the project. They're on track to attain their saving goals on schedule and on budget. We continue to believe the majority of the company OIP savings will drop to the bottom line, and we're driving internal accountabilities to ensure that happens.  We will have more detailed information on margin impact during our Analyst Day in September. 
Now I'll review the first quarter 2016 legacy Towers Watson segment results and outlook, and Roger will provide the legacy Willis results and provide updated 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. 
As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies. The Willis margins include amortization, cash incentives and some of the restructuring cost, whereas Towers Watson margins exclude amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition cost and discretionary compensation. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of legacy Towers Watson segments. 
On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in Benefits increased 1%, Exchange Solutions increased 57%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 4%, and Talent and Rewards decreased 9%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. So let's look at each segment in more depth, starting with Benefits. 
For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $486 million, which represents a 1% increase as compared to a 5% pro forma revenue increase in the first quarter of 2015. Retirement revenues decreased by 2%, Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 8%,  and Technology and Administration Solutions revenues were up 8%. We don't anticipate any special demand for actuarial consulting services in 2016. Demand is expected to be good for healthcare consulting, and technology and administration is expected to go live with many client implementations throughout the year, which will drive additional revenues.  We expect Benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the low-single-digit range. Benefits had an NOI margin of 36%, and we continue to expect this segment to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016. 
Exchange Solutions had an outstanding quarter, with revenues of $152 million, a pro forma increase of 57%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 48%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 47%. And the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 73%, and 49% on an organic basis. Increased enrollments in new client revenues drove the revenue increases. Our consumer-directed accounts practice also contributed approximately $9 million in revenue this quarter.  
We believe the increase in lives will continue to support good growth for the rest of 2016, but we don't expect much off-cycle work during the calendar year. We have increased revenue growth expectations from low to mid-20% to a high 20% range for calendar year '16. 
Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin as compared to 21% in last year's first quarter. The Retiree and Access Exchanges line of business led this segment with a 48% NOI margin. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the high-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year. 
For the quarter, Risk and Financial services had revenues of $144 million, a pro forma decline of 4%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 5% due to a softness in EMEA life consulting and a general softness in demand in the Americas. Investment revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in EMEA as demand softened for advisory services.  The Risk and Financial services segment is expected to have low-single-digit revenue growth for calendar year '16. We recently invested in senior marketing staff and the pipeline appears to be greater than at this point last year. We anticipate the impact of our marketing investments to impact revenues in the second half of the year. In addition, the prior year comparables for investments aren't as tough.  Risk and Financial services had a 23% NOI margin, and we expect to manage the business to achieve mid-20% margins. 
Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $124 million, down 9% on a pro forma constant currency basis and down 6% on a pro forma organic basis, as compared to the prior year quarter, which experienced 15% revenue growth. 
Executive Compensation revenues were down 1% as compared to 11% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Data, surveys and technology revenues decreased by 15%. We saw a 4% decline on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 9% revenue growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. As a reminder, we acquired Saville Consulting and sold our HR Service Delivery business. 
Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased 9% as compared to 23% growth in the first quarter of calendar year '15. Talent and Rewards had a 10% NOI margin for the quarter. The first half of the calendar year is generally soft for this segment. We see an overall decrease in the number of transactions in the market globally, and as a result, we anticipate this impacting the segment's topline results, given that we're lowering our revenue outlook from a mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth to a low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with margins in the mid-20% range. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger."
36623,331460633,977639,"Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone.

I'd like to first reiterate John's comment on the great collaboration we're experiencing in Willis Towers Watson. The level of engagement I've seen from the operating committee members to colleagues around the globe has been tremendous. It really is an exciting time to be part of Willis Towers Watson and based on the foundation being created now, I look forward to a very successful future. 
Before moving to the performance of the legacy Willis segments, I'd like to add more color on John's comments regarding the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I'd also like to discuss a couple of noteworthy adjustments to earnings which were highlighted in the press release today. 
There were 2 significant positive impacts to adjusted diluted earnings per share: First, our adjusted tax rate came in at 19%, which was lower than our forecast. Due to the seasonal strength of our profitability this quarter, we expect higher tax rates in the coming quarters, particularly in those quarters with seasonally lower operating profit. 
Second, our outstanding weighted average diluted share count came in lower-than-expected due to the merger closing 4 days into the quarter. This lowered our average diluted share count to approximately $136 million. The current outstanding diluted shares are approximately $138 million. 
Now let me turn to the reconciliation of segment operating income to income from operations, which was highlighted in our press release this morning. Most of these adjustments are self-explanatory, but I thought there were 2 items which perhaps needed some additional explanation. 
First, amortization of $126 million represents the intangibles amortization which is excluded from the legacy Towers Watson segment results. In addition to this, there is $35 million of amortization expense reported in the legacy Willis segment results. The reporting treatment will be uniform next quarter when we report on the consolidated Willis Towers Watson segments. 
Second, as we've described in public filings, relevant parties have agreed in principle to settle the Stanford litigation for $120 million and seek a court issued bar order against all Stanford-related claims. We recorded a $70 million provision in the December quarter based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The balance of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter once the settlement amount and terms were agreed.  The settlement will need final court approval, which if granted, may take several quarters. This is still ongoing litigation, so we're not able to provide more detail beyond what we've already said in our public filings. 
Now let me turn to the legacy Willis segment performance. 
On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees, or C&F, for international increased by 84%; North America increased 3%; capital, wholesale and reinsurance increased by 14%; and Great Britain was flat. All of the C&F results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Now let's look at each of the legacy Willis segments in more depth. 
Turning to Willis International. With the consolidation of Gras Savoye, which contributed $235 million to revenue in the quarter, the top line grew 84% from the prior year. Gras Savoye's contribution for the quarter was bit ahead of plan. On an organic basis, international C&F declined by 5%. This was driven by weakness in Asia and a cancellation adjustment for a large natural resources project. This cancellation was not related to the economic environment of the energy sector, but was political in nature. 
We continued to see strong growth in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The segment's operating profit margin was 30% this quarter. Our outlook for organic C&F growth for the full year is in the mid-single-digit range with net operating margin in the low- to mid-teens range. 
Willis North America had a nice start to the year with organic C&F growth of 4%. The segment saw strength in all of its core regions across a number of lines of business, most notably construction, financial institutions and FINEX despite modest pricing headwinds. The Human Capital Practice also contributed mid-single-digit organic growth during the quarter. The segment's operating margin of 23% was modestly ahead of our expectations and highlights some of the strategic changes we've been making related to the Operational Improvement Program. 
The outlook for Willis North America organic C&F growth continues to be in the low- to mid-single digits with a margin in the high teens. 
Now turning to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CWR generated commissions and fees growth of 14%, driven primarily by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services which contributed $49 million of C&F in the quarter. Organic C&F declined 3%, primarily due to the year-over-year decline of our fine arts and jewelry business as a result of the departure of the team of associates to JLT, for which we recently settled litigation, as well as a strong comparable in the reinsurance business, which benefited last year by an uplift of $6.5 million on a restructured account. 
CWR's operating margin was 46% as this segment' business is seasonally weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect reported growth to be in the low double digits as Miller fully rolls on through the first half of the year. Organic C&F growth is expected to be in the low-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we don't see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates.  I should note that in our growth guidance for CWR on a commission and fees basis, is lower than the total revenues guidance we provided previously. This results from the fact that the earlier guidance included the anticipated impact of the $40 million settlement with JLT, which will be recognized in the second quarter as other income in total revenues. This item will not be adjusted out of GAAP earnings, consistent with the historic practice. We expect operating margin to be in the low-20% range. 
Finally, Willis GB C&F growth was flat for the quarter. The cancellation adjustment for the large natural resources project mentioned earlier also impacted Willis GB. Organic C&F declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the natural resources project, organic growth would have been up approximately 2%. The segment's reported operating margin was 14%, modestly lower as compared to the prior year, driven by the project-related revenue decline and some one-time expense adjustments. 
We continue to have a positive outlook for the business, and these one-time revenue and expense events which occurred this quarter are not indicative of our future outlook. Our outlook for organic C&F growth is in the low-single-digit range with margin in the high-20% range. 
Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. We issued a $1 billion of U.S. dollar notes in March, $450 million at 3.5%, with a maturity date of September 2021 and $550 million at 4.4% with a maturity date of March 26. We expect to go to the euro market for an additional $600 million to $800 million. Being in the market recently and finalizing the timing of our refinancing, we expect our interest charges to be approximately $200 million for the year 2016.  The proceeds from the dollar offering were used to repay our $300 million public note, which matured in March, repay the USD 400 million tranche of our 1 year banknote and reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. 
Let me turn now to capital allocation. 
As we mentioned, during the last earnings call, we expect to have a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility, while maintaining an investment grade-rated balance sheet. On a Moody's basis, this equates to a threshold of approximately 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Currently, our Moody's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 3.7. We expect this to self-correct over the next several quarters as our restructuring expenses decline, merger-related cost reduction programs are implemented and profits increase. 
We believe we have several hundred million dollars of capital allocation flexibility for the second half of the year. As always, we'll weigh the benefit of potential acquisitions versus repurchasing shares. We prefer to do good acquisitions, and after that, look to share buybacks, consistent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. 
Free cash flow was $70 million this quarter. Free cash flow is expected to generally improve through each consecutive quarter during the calendar year. This quarter we paid approximately $500 million in incentive compensation, which included the normal pay cycle for former Willis colleagues and a partial year bonus for former Towers Watson Associates. Additionally, we contributed approximately $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2016. We'll continue to incur various merger and integration-related costs. These costs will continue to be material as we work through the integration period, and we expect them to be in approximately the $150 million to $170 million -- I'm sorry, $175 million range for 2016. The level of spending will depend on how quickly we move through some of the integration activities. Both deferred revenues and transaction and integration related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. 
In fiscal '16, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low-double digits, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. For purposes of segment guidance, we'll use commissions and fees, which excludes other revenue. As noted previously, a legal settlement of approximately $40 million will be posted to other income in the second quarter. 
As we guide to overall company performance, we'll use total revenues, which includes fees and commissions and other revenues. We continue to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but based on the first quarter results, our expectations are a bit muted versus the beginning of the year. 
Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 20%, an increase from our previous guidance of around 19.5%. In calendar 2015, adjusted operating income was 19.1%. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. The current GAAP rate of approximately 7% is due to a number of factors, but the main driver is related to the valuation of intangibles as a result of purchase accounting.  The amortization of the intangibles is somewhat front-end loaded and the current GAAP rate will not be sustained over time. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.43 to the pound and $1.10 to the euro. While we've maintained our overall revenue growth projections, the first quarter has dampened the range of this growth. Our leadership team is aligned and committed to manage expenses as needed to achieve our 2016 adjusted EPS goal. 
Once again, we have many moving pieces related to the merger and integration, but I'm extremely pleased with how things are progressing. Our intent is to continue to streamline reporting over the next several quarters and provide a clear line of sight to our operations and results. Now I'll turn it back to John."

And then international, within legacy Willis and the CWR segment, is a little bit softer. So I think those are all the areas that were a little bit off where we expected. We do think that some of the elements there are timing in nature. So perhaps, you might look at our guidance and be surprised that we're not a little bit more muted. But we think that in Asia, we've mentioned Asia and international, there were some deals that didn't come in, in the first quarter, but we've seen them coming in later in the year.

We think there's opportunity there. We think that OIP is clearly a great asset to have as we move towards that target and is producing real results. So we do think, as you look at some comparables, that there's opportunity to enhance margin, and we're on the case. So I think that's the margin piece. I would say broadly, and maybe John wants to comment on this a little bit, relative to our past experience, but when you look at the growth results here versus other players in the market, first, legacy Willis was moving the last couple of years organically in that 3% to 4% range. There were some headwinds this quarter. Some of those were, again, timing in nature, including the pipeline adjustments that we talked about, which was probably worth about 0.5 point of growth. So I think you consider the overall merger activity and you look at comparables, and I think -- again, we're confident in improved growth -- organic growth as we go through the year, and while, again, a little bit muted, we think we're in an okay place here as we start the year."

It's still early days for that. And I mean -- I think when I went through the different revenue synergies, I acknowledge, we're seeing these things for the Exchange Solutions and for some of the others, but it's still really early. I mean, most of those revenue synergies, we will see them in the back half of the 3 years, not in the end. I think the important thing from my viewpoint, though, is how quickly we're starting to at least see some of them come in, and it's very encouraging for the long-term trend. I think -- so it was really a confluence of different things, but on Exchange Solutions, we're delighted with just the growth in the retirees, in the actives and really across the board there."

I mean, I think, again, the trajectory that we expect from an EBITDA margin point of view, and I won't say necessarily every quarter. But given our focus, we expect gradually improving EBITDA margins. For this quarter particularly, one thing that we mentioned just briefly in the script that was a little bit stronger than our forecast and led to some of the margin enhancement, again, versus what we expected is Gras Savoye came in stronger in the first quarter than expected. Some of that was just due to some revenue accounting comparability between the 2 firms. So we haven't changed our view on the full year for Gras Savoye, and they're coming in nicely, but it did give some acceleration into the first quarter.  I think otherwise, OIP savings are flowing in. I think the team was attentive. And you might recall, if you followed both the legacy companies, there was cost activity going on as we entered the merger in both companies, and we're seeing a benefit of that. So I think, otherwise, there's disciplined operating activity going on. I mean, we did mention again -- and it is unfortunate with the project cancellation that we mentioned earlier, but when you look at the 2 parts of legacy Willis that were farthest advanced in the OIP program, both North America and GB are seeing a benefit now in their margins of OIP. Unfortunately, in GB, because of the cancellation, it's not as visible as it otherwise would have been."

So look, when we -- we didn't mean to signal any change from anything we said before. What Roger was saying is we expect to have a few hundred million dollars available in the second half of the year, which is I think always what we had talked about. This formulation that we said that what we want to do is maximize shareholder return. Generally, if we can find a very attractive acquisition, that's probably the way we could do that best, and we're always looking to do that. But as a practical matter, there's no way we're going to do any kind of really major acquisition in the first year or 1.5 year of this merger. We have work to do there, even a more modest acquisition. If there was something that was a unique property, that if we didn't buy it now, there wouldn't be an opportunity to buy one like that in the future, we might consider something like that. But in general, we're going to have higher standards for doing any acquisitions. But our overall approach has always been acquisitions are first, but we have some high standards for doing that, so it's hard to find them. And then after that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. I think our free cash flow is going to be the major source of how we can do that, and we're looking to, in general, deploy a lot of our free cash flow over the coming years to be doing share repurchases. We don't need any kind of a specific authorization from the board. We don't need any new authorization. We have about $500 million authorization that already exists.

With Willis Towers Watson and the relatively limited overlap we had, we've seen, I think more energy and excitement among colleagues at an earlier stage than we ever have before. We have been looking at our turnover statistics. There's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, if anything, they're a little bit lower than I might have expected. I think that we expect that we'll see normal turnover -- I was prepared for turnover actually, especially maybe last year between announcement and the closing to be a little bit higher than usual. We did not see that. And I think that, again, goes back to the enthusiasm that our colleagues around the world have had for this."

We see basically some cons and some pros. The London insurance market could see some premium declines accelerate. The insurance centers could move elsewhere. On the other hand, there is added complexity in the marketplaces, in general, something that's good for consulting firms and for brokers. There would be issues around if people did move legal entities or capital or staffing, that would create opportunities for us, in particular, could benefit CRB and HCB . So I think there would clearly be some short-term dislocations.

Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment res",1918,"Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016. 
We're pleased with our performance this quarter in a business environment that had some challenges. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion, which includes $31 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Adjusted revenues, which includes $26 million of deferred revenues, were up 11% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Commissions and fees were up 3% on an organic basis. 
Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $72 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $114 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $401 million or 22.1% of adjusted revenues. The second quarter is the seasonally weak quarter due to the low level of renewals for some lines of business, primarily related to Gras Savoye and Miller, where they had very strong renewals in the first quarter. Portions of the consulting and administration businesses also have weaker performance in the second quarter of the calendar year due to seasonality. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $1,077,000,000 or 25.4% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2015 of $979 million or 25.6% of adjusted revenues. Due to the seasonality quarter-over-quarter, we believe the first half of calendars 2016 is a more meaningful indicator of performance. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.60. 
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergy; cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 9 global healthcare solution clients, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange. We've won a number of new clients with approximately 70,000 eligible lives for implementations this year and continued to see the pipeline build. To provide some context to the 2017 Willis, acting as our channel partner last year, sold approximately 9,000 lives for all of 2016. 
Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 10 new projects so far this year. We're certainly off to a strong start, but we continue to believe that our revenue synergies will be much more heavily weighted to 2017 and 2018. As we've mentioned last quarter, most of these wins will not have a significant impact on our 2016 financial results, however, we're very pleased with the progress to date. 
Now moving on to the tax and costs synergies. We continued to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We are reaching the estimating merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. As noted last quarter, we plan to save about $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of about $30 million. 
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $97 million from [ph] the second quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $16 million of restructuring costs in the same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 and remain committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. OIP continues to be on track. We'll have more detailed information regarding margin impact at our Analyst Day in September. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital and benefits increased 3%, corporate risk and broking increased 9%, investment risk and Reinsurance increased 7% and Exchange Solutions increased 47%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Okay. So now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital and Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 3%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to strong demand in Great Britain, which was offset by the expected decline in the U.S. revenues with the decreased demand for both lump sum project work. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down, as the number of M&A transactions and special projects slowed year-over-year. Health and benefits serves continues to see strong demand on the U.S. large company. And as I mentioned earlier, the global benefit solution business had strong momentum. 
Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to increased projects and call center demand. We continued to have a positive outlook for the HCB business for the rest of 2016. The demand for both lump sum projects and onetime annuity purchases had been picking up, and we expect greater activity for the second half of the calendar year. Talent and Rewards generally has easier comps and a promising data services pipeline. We also continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses. 
Turning to Corporate Risk and Brokering or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 9% from the prior year, largely as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees grew by 1%. 
In North America, commissions and fees were down slightly after a strong first quarter. Retention levels were strong, but we experienced lower levels of new businesses compared to last year. 
Great Britain produced solid results as the P&C and financial lines led our growth. The international region had modest growth despite a challenging quarter for both China and Brazil. 
Western Europe had solid organic results given the environment, and Iberia was particularly strong, growing mid-single digits as a result of new business. 
We expect CRB to show growth in the second half of the calendar year. We've seen some slowdown in the emerging markets but generally, we see a good pipeline around the globe even if it is a bit softer than a year ago. While we don't believe the North America new business levels show any secular change in the market, we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
Now to investment risk and reinsurance. Commissions and fees grew 7% for the quarter, driven by the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services, which is performing in line with our acquisition assumptions. Organic commissions and fees declined 4.5%, primarily due to a continued decline in demand for risk consulting projects, lower demand for investment advisory services, lower profit sharing on certain insurance contracts and a slowdown in Capital Markets. 
Capital Markets commissions and fees are closely tied to the number of insurance-related M&A transactions, and we've seen a significant slowdowns in transactions year-over-year. Reinsurance commissions and fees were flat as the international market and the specialty business did quite well but new business was soft in North America. We anticipate some growth in the second half of the year as comparables get a bit easier for the IRR segment and we maybe seeing a slight increase in demand for Reinsurance due to the recent losses noted by many of the carriers this past quarter. However, we expect most of the market headwinds related to this segment to continue for the rest of the calendar year. 
As discussed in the last earnings call, JLT paid a $40 million settlement in quarter 2 related to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. This settlement was included in IRR's total revenues as other income. This item has not been adjusted out of GAAP earnings, and this is consistent with historic practice. 
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up a strong first quarter with another outstanding quarter, with commissions and fees of $154 million, an increase of 47%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions' segment grew by 43%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenues increased 48% and the other Exchange Solutions business has increased 44% and 36% on an organic basis. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. 
Our health and welfare administration business is growing, primarily as a result of the unprecedented new business won over the last 2 years. 
I'd also like to provide some comments regarding the selling season for the 2017 enrollment period. We had a strong selling season and expect to enroll over 300,000 retirees and active employees onto our exchanges. In the retiree space, a little over 100,000 retirees are expected to enroll for 2017. Now we had a record enrollment last year as a result of the state of Ohio, and we did not anticipate duplicating the 2016 enrollment levels. While we are enrolling the retirees of a large state of municipality this year, we continue to feel confident in this market in the long term. However, we would also expect that the enrollments in this market will have some volatility from year-to-year. 
In the active space, we sold approximately 200,000 lives, with 1 client opting to enroll for 2018. We anticipate enrollment growth of approximately 80% to 100% year-over-year. I've previously mentioned the success we had in the mid-market in a very short time since the merger. I've had one comment in my previous statements regarding the mid-market environment. It appears that the adoption rate in the mid-market has accelerated, and we feel that this is sustainable. We continue to see strong interest from the large market, and we've had some success in winning a few large clients, but the pace of adoption continues to be slower as these organizations are still taking more time to make decisions. We can't predict the inflection point in this market, but the value exchange provide to both the employee and employer is quite impactful, and we continue to expect the large market to be a significant part of the overall exchange markets. We expect the second half will be strong but we will not have any significant off-cycle enrollments this year, so the second half commissions and fees growth rates will be lower than we've seen year-to-date. In the exchanges other, we continue to add new administration clients but have strong comparables in the fourth quarter. So we would expect commission and fee growth rates to normalize for this line of business as well. 
I'm encouraged by the quarterly results, the strong collaboration we're experiencing at the grassroots level, the commitment to the integration efforts, including the revenue synergies and of course, the continued focus on our clients. I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their hard work in helping shape this organization for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'd also like to add my thanks to our colleagues for all their hard work. Prior to the merger, in a previous call, I talked about the unique opportunity we had to create a powerful organization, which would be stronger than what we could have achieved as individual organizations. Now that we're into our eighth month of integration, I'm happy to say that we're seeing clear development of these merger synergy focus areas. We have confirmation that the enhanced global footprint and large market relationships are having a positive impact on our global benefit solutions business. We're seeing some early success in utilizing the U.S. mid-market distribution network for our healthcare exchange, and we've had some early wins in the large market P&C space and our cost rationalization efforts are bearing fruit. There's a lot of hard work ahead of us, but seeing the collaboration among our colleagues and the market activity make me optimistic that we're creating the powerful organization that we envisioned.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $136 million or 7% of revenues. The prior year second quarter pro forma operating income was $170 million or 9.4% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues. In the prior year quarter, pro forma adjusted operating income was $347 million or 19.2% of adjusted revenues. Income from operations for the first half of 2016 was $462 million or 11% of revenues. The prior year first half pro forma operating income was $553 million or 14.5% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2016 was $1 billion or 23.7% of adjusted revenues and the prior year first half pro forma adjusted operating income was $884 million or 23% of adjusted revenues. 
During the quarter, we recognized a net $6 million currency gains as shown in other nonoperating income. This gain is driven by the reversal of the currency loss recognized on certain balance sheet positions in the first quarter. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21% and the adjusted tax rate was 25%. 
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we've provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. 
For the second quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital and Benefits segment, or HCB, was 15% as compared to pro forma 20% last year. Commission and fee declines in talent rewards and quarterly timing in the mid-market health and benefits business and in incentive costs drove the second quarter margin lower than the prior year. As a reminder, the North America mid-market health and benefits business placed a greater number of their policies in the first quarter this year, depressing the second quarter results. For the first half of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 24% as compared to 26% in 2015. We anticipate the HCB segment margin to be in the low 20% range for the year. 
For the second quarter, the corporate risk and broking segment, or CRB, had a 19% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 22% in the prior year. For the first half of 2016, the CRB operating margin was 19% as compared to 17% last year. As a result of the heavy lift weighting of commissions and fees for Gras Savoye in the first quarter, the seasonality of the quarterly margin has changed as well. We anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The team is focused on balancing the expense base against the current revenue environment in order to drive margin enhancement. 
For the quarter, the investment risk And reinsurance segment, or IRR, had a 25% operating margin. The margin included the $40 million JLT settlement relating to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. Without the legal settlement, IRR's operating margin would have been 17% for the second quarter or flat year-over-year. The increased margin was a result of the legal settlement and the Miller acquisition, which were partially offset by the decline in commissions and fees in the Risk Consulting and Software and investment businesses. Inclusive of the legal settlement, we expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year. 
Exchange Solutions' operating margin was quite strong at 20% as compared to 8% in last year's quarter. For the first half of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions' segment operating margin was 22% as compared to 11% last year. 
For the quarter, the Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with a 45% operating margin, with margins being flat to down for all other lines of business. We continue to invest in the actives exchange. Margin on the administration business is generally soft for several quarters as new clients come on the platform. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions' segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the year due to our enrollment season. Costs build up prior to the open enrollment, but commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, we successfully issued our first public Eurobond of EUR 540 million, 6-year issuance. This transaction completed our debt restructuring plan for the year. A portion of the bond proceeds were used to pay off the remaining balance on the $1 billion term loan facility we entered into in November 2015. 
We also reinitiated our stock buyback program in June. Through August 1, we've repurchased $100 million or approximately 805,000 shares. We anticipate repurchasing another $200 million by the end of December for a total repurchase of $300 million for the 2016 calendar year.
Free cash flow was $265 million this quarter and $335 million for the first half of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016 for Willis Towers Watson. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for integration- and transaction-related items. Our deferred revenue add back adjustments were completed in the June quarter. Integration- and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.
In fiscal '16, we expect reported revenue growth to be around 7% and constant currency revenue growth to be around 10%, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions and the Exchange Solutions' segment. We're bringing organic revenue growth guidance down to a range of 2% to 3%. Although the second quarter organic growth was quite solid at 5% overall and 3% for commissions and fees, we continue to see headwinds and lag where we expect it to be. This new range reflects the market environment we've seen in the first half, with some expectation of slightly improved commission and fee organic growth in the second half due to pockets of improve the business momentum and areas of better sequential and year-over-year comparisons. 
We continue to expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 8% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. We believe the various cost-reduction programs underway will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.68. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is down from the previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.95. Guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.38 to the pound and $1.11 to the euro. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the integration efforts, including the early wins that relate to our revenue synergies. The focus on margin growth and our continued progress in streamlining reporting. Now I'll turn it back to John."

I think, we see some challenges in Talent and Rewards, as I mentioned. And specifically, that is obviously the most economically sensitive of our businesses there and tends to go up and down. As we've seen a cutback on M&A and on some other projects, that has impacted where we are. We don't feel that we're losing out necessarily to the market at all. I just think we see the market as being a little bit slower. We do feel pretty good about -- that we think we'll see a little more of a pick up there. We have easier comparables, and we also see maybe a slightly improved pipeline for the second half of the year. So while it's down, we don't feel that we're losing any market share, and we feel that we continue to be well positioned there. I think in the Risk Consulting and Software and in the investment part of the business, those are both ones that I've seen some challenges in the last couple of years really. And I think we continue to see them undergoing some challenges. Now the Risk Consulting and Software is not one that our major competitors really have, so we don't have any direct comparables there. But we do see a decline in a lot of the risk consulting projects. The software piece of that business is doing relatively well but the consulting part of the business, we're just seeing a less of an appetite for that among our clients. And I would say that again, it's not so much that it strikes us that we're losing market share there. It's that we just see the market being softer than it had been. In the investment part of the world, we don't run the funds of funds and so we don't have a direct comparison again to some of our competitors, but we are seeing a decline in some of the consulting projects around that. And so we're seeing more of a focus to some of our delegated investment, which I think was the growth area that we see. But a large part of our business has been consulting, and we do see some softness there. If I look at the rest of the businesses, whether it's legacy Willis or legacy Towers Watson, I think we see some ups and downs. I think, in general, we're within 1% or so of where the market is going, with the -- with maybe an exception of the Exchange Solution, which has just had a fantastic half -- first half of the year."

If we kind of live in a market -- in an environment with a 2% GDP, the 10-year stays around 2%, inflation is kind of constant and the P&C rates stay in this sort of negative -- a couple hundred basis points maybe, is that an environment where you feel confident that you're going to be able to drive towards that 10 10 number in 2018?

So let me just sort of talk about that at an overall level there. I think as you mentioned, when I was responding to the question about the legacy Towers Watson, I said to the extent we see some areas that are underperforming, we have a sense that if the market and not so much as specific things go in there. One of the things that makes a little bit difficult is in some of those areas like Risk Consulting and Software. We don't have natural competitors that are public companies to look to, to see what the market is. But our overall sense is just that the market is down there. And we've been through this. We see some ups and downs. We have areas like our old Talent and Rewards that are very heavily dependent on the economy overall. So we see those going on. We have areas, we have similar areas like that in -- from the legacy Willis part of the business. So when we look at the Capital Markets area there, that's a small area but it's one that is very sensitive to the amount of insurance-related transaction -- M&A transactions that are going on. And for comparison last year, there was $110 billion in M&A transactions in the insurance space. So far this year, there's been $10 billion. That's a pretty big difference, and it's one of the reasons why that is contributed to a decline in the IRR this year. I think when we look at it, there's a couple areas where we are trailing the market. I think if we look at our corporate risk and broking and if we look at the Reinsurance, we're a little bit lower than the market there. I think in both cases, we look at those as it maybe, in some cases, a portfolio of that. So for example, I think the international, which has been the real source of growth for Willis versus the market over the last several years, that's the area that's particularly down this year. And so that may affect us more than some of our competitors. But I think it's safe to say that we're probably 1% or so below them this year. We don't see anything that's structural. We think that some of that is related to just some goings on in the business that we expect to reverse themselves. We expect to be growing at about the level of the market or better in 2017."

But by far, the bulk of it will occur in the first half. So I don't have all at my fingertips, whether it's like 80% occurs in the first half or it's probably something like that. But we'll get you those numbers. I would think it's safe to say though that the bulk of the sales have already occurred by far, although there will be some continuing. I think I made a comment in the script to say that we look at the mid-market as the saying that it's accelerated and that we feel that that's sustainable. So that's based on our talking with clients, our seeing what's happening to the pipeline. So I don't think we're expecting to see we've had a terrific first half of the year in terms of selling this. We're not predicting any decline in the second half as a result of that. We think we're going to continue to see the mid-market being an important source of new business."

It can vary based on the specific geographical distribution of the employers. It can vary based on what kind of planned are coming from, whether they already have planned that, for example, have high deductibles or what other features they might have already have built into it. Generally, we look at saving between 5% and 15% for the employer. Although often, what will happen is the employers will probably give about 2/3 of that back to -- or about 1/3 of that back to the employees and keep about 2/3. So when they make the exchange, it's a win-win for both the employer and employee in terms of the cost aspect to that. That's been something that we've seen since the beginning. We don't -- we're not seeing any change in that overall. I think in terms of growth adoption rate, it's hard to say exactly what or whether people distracted by some of these other ACA. I tend to think that, that's not the case. I think we have seen, as I said, the mid-market pickup. And in fact, if you are thinking about employers that might be distracted more you might think that actually it's the smaller one that have more of those distractions. So I don't think that's what we're really seeing there. I do think we're seeing the natural conservatism of larger organizations continue to be a factor in the marketplace. But we are seeing the smaller ones adopting it as somewhat more enthusiastically than they did even a year ago."

And I guess, it was last month after Brexit it went through that. I would say, we really don't have any change in views or necessarily guidance from then to now. When we look at Brexit, I think it's a hodgepodge of both pluses and minuses. And when we look at our overall exposure, for example, incorporate risk and broking, the overall CRB revenue exposure is about 7% of our revenues. So it's not like we see that, that is the biggest deal in the world. If markets were to move from moving to elsewhere, it's not clear that we're disadvantaged by that. In fact, we might even advantage depending where it were to move to. So I think there's nothing that we see now that will say this is necessarily a problem for us.

Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016.

Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016. 
We're pleased with our performance this quarter in a business environment that had some challenges. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion, which includes $31 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Adjusted revenues, which includes $26 million of deferred revenues, were up 11% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Commissions and fees were up 3% on an organic basis. 
Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $72 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $114 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $401 million or 22.1% of adjusted revenues. The second quarter is the seasonally weak quarter due to the low level of renewals for some lines of business, primarily related to Gras Savoye and Miller, where they had very strong renewals in the first quarter. Portions of the consulting and administration businesses also have weaker performance in the second quarter of the calendar year due to seasonality. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $1,077,000,000 or 25.4% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2015 of $979 million or 25.6% of adjusted revenues. Due to the seasonality quarter-over-quarter, we believe the first half of calendars 2016 is a more meaningful indicator of performance. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.66. 
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 9 global healthcare solution clients, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange. We've won a number of new clients with approximately 70,000 eligible lives for implementations this year and continued to see the pipeline build. To provide some context to the 2017 wins, Willis, acting as our channel partner last year, sold approximately 9,000 lives for all of 2016. 
Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 10 new projects so far this year. We're certainly off to a strong start, but we continue to believe that our revenue synergies will be much more heavily weighted to 2017 and 2018. As we've mentioned last quarter, most of these wins will not have a significant impact on our 2016 financial results, however, we're very pleased with the progress to date. 
Now moving on to the tax and costs synergies. We continued to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We are reaching the estimating merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. As noted last quarter, we plan to save about $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of about $30 million. 
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $97 million from [ph] the second quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $16 million of restructuring costs in this same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 and remain committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. OIP continues to be on track. We'll have more detailed information regarding margin impact at our Analyst Day in September. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital and benefits increased 3%, corporate risk and broking increased 9%, investment risk and Reinsurance increased 7% and Exchange Solutions increased 47%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Okay. So now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital and Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 3%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to strong demand in Great Britain, which was offset by the expected decline in the U.S. revenues with the decreased demand for both lump sum project work. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down, as the number of M&A transactions and special projects slowed year-over-year. Health and Benefits services continues to see strong demand and the U.S. large company. And as I mentioned earlier, the Global benefit solution business had strong momentum. 
Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to increased projects and call center demand. We continued to have a positive outlook for the HCB business for the rest of 2016. The demand for both lump sum projects and onetime annuity purchases has been picking up, and we expect greater activity for the second half of the calendar year. Talent and Rewards generally has easier comps and a promising data services pipeline. We also continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses. 
Turning to Corporate Risk and Brokering or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 9% from the prior year, largely as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees grew by 1%. 
In North America, commissions and fees were down slightly after a strong first quarter. Retention levels were strong, but we experienced lower levels of new business as compared to last year. 
Great Britain produced solid results as the P&C and financial lines led our growth. The international region had modest growth despite a challenging quarter for both China and Brazil. 
Western Europe had solid organic results given the environment, and Iberia was particularly strong, growing mid-single digits as a result of new business. 
We expect CRB to show growth in the second half of the calendar year. We've seen some slowdown in the emerging markets but generally, we see a good pipeline around the globe even if it is a bit softer than a year ago. While we don't believe the North America new business levels show any secular change in the market, we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
Now to investment risk and reinsurance. Commissions and fees grew 7% for the quarter, driven by the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services, which is performing in line with our acquisition assumptions. Organic commissions and fees declined 4.5%, primarily due to a continued decline in demand for risk consulting projects, lower demand for investment advisory services, lower profit sharing on certain insurance contracts and a slowdown in Capital Markets. 
Capital Markets commissions and fees are closely tied to the number of insurance-related M&A transactions, and we've seen a significant slowdown in transactions year-over-year. Reinsurance commissions and fees were flat as the international market and the specialty business did quite well but new business was soft in North America. We anticipate some growth in the second half of the year as comparables get a bit easier for the IRR segment and we may be seeing a slight increase in demand for Reinsurance due to the recent losses noted by many of the carriers this past quarter. However, we expect most of the market headwinds related to this segment to continue for the rest of the calendar year. 
As discussed in the last earnings call, JLT paid a $40 million settlement in quarter 2 related to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. This settlement was included in IRR's total revenues as other income. This item has not been adjusted out of GAAP earnings, and this is consistent with historic practice. 
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up a strong first quarter with another outstanding quarter, with commissions and fees of $154 million, an increase of 47%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions' segment grew by 43%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenues increased 48% and the other Exchange Solutions business has increased 44% and 36% on an organic basis. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. 
Our health and welfare administration business is growing, primarily as a result of the unprecedented new business won over the last 2 years. 
I'd also like to provide some comments regarding the selling season for the 2017 enrollment period. We had a strong selling season and expect to enroll over 300,000 retirees and active employees onto our exchanges. In the retiree space, a little over 100,000 retirees are expected to enroll for 2017. Now we had a record enrollment last year as a result of the state of Ohio, and we did not anticipate duplicating the 2016 enrollment levels. While we aren't enrolling the retirees of a large state of municipality this year, we continue to feel confident in this market in the long term. However, we would also expect that the enrollments in this market will have some volatility from year-to-year. 
In the active space, we sold approximately 200,000 lives, with 1 client opting to enroll for 2018. We anticipate enrollment growth of approximately 80% to 100% year-over-year. I've previously mentioned the success we've had in the mid-market in the very short time since the merger. I've had one comment in my previous statements regarding the mid-market environment. It appears that the adoption rate in the mid-market has accelerated, and we feel that this is sustainable. We continue to see strong interest from the large market, and we've had some success in winning a few large clients, but the pace of adoption continues to be slower as these organizations are still taking more time to make decisions. We can't predict the inflection point in this market, but the value Exchanges provide to both the employee and employer is quite impactful, and we continue to expect the large market to be a significant part of the overall exchange market. We expect the second half will be strong but we will not have any significant off-cycle enrollments this year, so the second half commissions and fees growth rates will be lower than we've seen year-to-date. In the Exchanges Other, we continue to add new administration clients but have strong comparables in the fourth quarter. So we would expect commission and fee growth rates to normalize for this line of business as well. 
I'm encouraged by the quarterly results, the strong collaboration we're experiencing at the grassroots level, the commitment to the integration efforts, including the revenue synergies and of course, the continued focus on our clients. I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their hard work in helping shape this organization for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'd also like to add my thanks to our colleagues for all their hard work. Prior to the merger, in a previous call, I talked about the unique opportunity we had to create a powerful organization, which would be stronger than what we could have achieved as individual organizations. Now that we're into our eighth month of integration, I'm happy to say that we're seeing clear development of these merger synergy focus areas. We have confirmation that the enhanced global footprint and large market relationships are having a positive impact on our Global Benefit Solutions business. We're seeing some early success in utilizing the U.S. mid-market distribution network for our healthcare exchange, and we've had some early wins in the large market P&C space and our cost rationalization efforts are bearing fruit. There's still a lot of hard work ahead of us, but seeing the collaboration among our colleagues and the market activity make me optimistic that we're creating the powerful organization that we envisioned.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $136 million or 7% of revenues. The prior year second quarter pro forma operating income was $170 million or 9.4% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues. In the prior year quarter, pro forma adjusted operating income was $347 million or 19.2% of adjusted revenues. Income from operations for the first half of 2016 was $462 million or 11% of revenues. The prior year first half pro forma operating income was $553 million or 14.5% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2016 was $1 billion or 23.7% of adjusted revenues and the prior year first half pro forma adjusted operating income was $884 million or 23% of adjusted revenues. 
During the quarter, we recognized a net $6 million currency gain as shown in other nonoperating income. This gain is driven by the reversal of the currency loss recognized on certain balance sheet positions in the first quarter. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21% and the adjusted tax rate was 25%. 
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we've provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. 
For the second quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital and Benefits segment, or HCB, was 15% as compared to pro forma 20% last year. Commission and fee declines in talent rewards and quarterly timing in the mid-market health and benefits business and in incentive costs drove the second quarter margin lower than the prior year. As a reminder, the North America mid-market health and benefits business placed a greater number of their policies in the first quarter this year, depressing the second quarter results. For the first half of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 24% as compared to 26% in 2015. We anticipate the HCB segment margin to be in the low 20% range for the year. 
For the second quarter, the corporate risk and broking segment, or CRB, had a 19% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 22% in the prior year. For the first half of 2016, the CRB operating margin was 19% as compared to 17% last year. As a result of the heavy lift weighting of commissions and fees for Gras Savoye in the first quarter, the seasonality of the quarterly margin has changed as well. We anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The team is focused on balancing the expense base against the current revenue environment in order to drive margin enhancement. 
For the quarter, the investment risk And reinsurance segment, or IRR, had a 25% operating margin. The margin included the $40 million JLT settlement relating to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. Without the legal settlement, IRR's operating margin would have been 17% for the second quarter or flat year-over-year. The increased margin was a result of the legal settlement and the Miller acquisition, which were partially offset by the decline in commissions and fees in the Risk Consulting and Software and investment businesses. Inclusive of the legal settlement, we expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year. 
Exchange Solutions' operating margin was quite strong at 20% as compared to 8% in last year's quarter. For the first half of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions' segment operating margin was 22% as compared to 11% last year. 
For the quarter, the Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with a 45% operating margin, with margins being flat to down for all other lines of business. We continue to invest in the actives exchange. Margin on the administration business is generally soft for several quarters as new clients come on the platform. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions' segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the year due to our enrollment season. Costs built up prior to the open enrollment, but commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, we successfully issued our first public Eurobond of EUR 540 million, 6-year issuance. This transaction completed our debt restructuring plan for the year. A portion of the bond proceeds were used to pay off the remaining balance on the $1 billion term loan facility we entered into in November 2015. 
We also reinitiated our stock buyback program in June. Through August 1, we've repurchased $100 million or approximately 805,000 shares. We anticipate repurchasing another $200 million by the end of December for a total repurchase of $300 million for the 2016 calendar year.
Free cash flow was $265 million this quarter and $335 million for the first half of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016 for Willis Towers Watson. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for integration- and transaction-related items. Our deferred revenue add back adjustments were completed in the June quarter. Integration- and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.
In fiscal '16, we expect reported revenue growth to be around 7% and constant currency revenue growth to be around 10%, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions and the Exchange Solutions' segment. We're bringing organic revenue growth guidance down to a range of 2% to 3%. Although the second quarter organic growth was quite solid at 5% overall and 3% for commissions and fees, we continue to see headwinds and lag where we expect it to be. This new range reflects the market environment we've seen in the first half, with some expectation of slightly improved commission and fee organic growth in the second half due to pockets of improved business momentum and areas of better sequential and year-over-year comparisons. 
We continue to expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 8% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. We believe the various cost-reduction programs underway will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.68. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is down from the previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.95. Guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.38 to the pound and $1.11 to the euro. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the integration efforts, including the early wins that relate to our revenue synergies. The focus on margin growth and our continued progress in streamlining reporting. Now I'll turn it back to John."

I think we see some challenges in Talent and Rewards, as I mentioned. And specifically, that is obviously the most economically sensitive of our businesses there and tends to go up and down. As we've seen a cutback on M&A and on some other projects, that has impacted where we are. We don't feel that we're losing out necessarily to the market at all. I just think we see the market as being a little bit slower. We do feel pretty good about -- that we think we'll see a little more of a pick up there. We have easier comparables, and we also see maybe a slightly improved pipeline for the second half of the year. So while it's down, we don't feel that we're losing any market share, and we feel that we continue to be well positioned there. I think in the Risk Consulting and Software and in the investment part of the business, those are both ones that have seen some challenges in the last couple of years really. And I think we continue to see them undergoing some challenges. Now the Risk Consulting and Software is not one that our major competitors really have, so we don't have any direct comparables there. But we do see a decline in a lot of the risk consulting projects. The software piece of that business is doing relatively well but the consulting part of the business, we're just seeing a less of an appetite for that among our clients. And I would say that again, it's not so much that it strikes us that we're losing market share there. It's that we just see the market being softer than it had been. In the investment part of the world, we don't run the funds of funds and so we don't have a direct comparison again to some of our competitors, but we are seeing a decline in some of the consulting projects around that. And so we're seeing more of a focus to some of our delegated investment, which I think was the growth area that we see. But a large part of our business has been consulting, and we do see some softness there. If I look at the rest of the businesses, whether it's legacy Willis or legacy Towers Watson, I think we see some ups and downs. I think, in general, we're within 1% or so of where the market is going, with the -- with maybe an exception of the Exchange Solution, which has just had a fantastic half -- first half of the year."

And it's really, as we said in the first quarter call, the Gras Savoye revenues came in about -- 70% of the revenues came in, in the first quarter so there's extreme seasonality that drove that. So again, as we said in the script, we think the 6-month margin numbers are more indicative of where the company is."

If we kind of live in a market -- in an environment with a 2% GDP, the 10-year stays around 2%, inflation is kind of constant and the P&C rates stay in this sort of negative -- a couple hundred basis points maybe, is that an environment where you feel confident that you're going to be able to drive towards that 10 10 number in 2018?

So let me just sort of talk about that at an overall level there. I think, as you mentioned, when I was responding to the question about the legacy Towers Watson, I said to the extent we see some areas that are underperforming, we have a sense that it's the market and not so much specific things going there. One of the things that makes it a little bit difficult is in some of those areas, like Risk Consulting and Software, we don't have natural competitors that are public companies to look to, to see what the market is. But our overall sense is just that the market is down there. And we've been through this. We see some ups and downs. We have areas like our old Talent and Rewards that are very heavily dependent on the economy overall. So we see those going on. We have areas, we have similar areas like that in -- from the legacy Willis part of the business. So when we look at the Capital Markets area there, that's a small area but it's one that is very sensitive to the amount of insurance-related transaction -- M&A transactions that are going on. And for comparison last year, there was $110 billion in M&A transactions in the insurance space. So far this year, there's been $10 billion. That's a pretty big difference, and it's one of the reasons why that has contributed to a decline in the IRR this year. I think when we look at it, there's a couple areas where we are trailing the market. I think if we look at our corporate risk and broking and if we look at the Reinsurance, we're a little bit lower than the market there. I think in both cases, we look at those as it may be, in some cases, a portfolio effect. So for example, I think the international, which has been the real source of growth for Willis versus the market over the last several years, that's the area that's particularly down this year. And so that may affect us more than some of our competitors. But I think it's safe to say that we're probably 1% or so below them this year. We don't see anything that's structural. We think that some of that is related to just some goings on in the business that we expect to reverse themselves. We expect to be growing at about the level of the market or better in 2017."

When we look at the -- there is obviously seasonality. And so we notice this in the old Towers Watson days. You get more turnover after you've just paid bonuses than you do there. We continue to see that. No particular changes there. And I think when we look at specifically where we've had some competitors try to target some of our individuals, one of the things we do is we prioritize those, and we don't necessarily try to respond to every rate on an employee like that. And we target the ones that we think are the real high-value employees. We've been very successful at that and we've continued to hold on to the ones that we really wanted to."

So I don't have right off at my fingertips here, Mark, the relative numbers for the second half, but the mid-market is different than the large market in that you can continue to have sales that occur up until almost to the November time frame in term -- and still implement them. But by far, the bulk of it will occur in the first half. So I don't have all at my fingertips, whether it's like 80% occurs in the first half or it's probably something like that. But we'll get you those numbers. I would think it's safe to say though that the bulk of the sales have already occurred by far, although there will be some continuing. I think I made a comment in the script to say that we look at the mid-market as saying that it's accelerated and that we feel that, that's sustainable. So that's based on our talking with clients, our seeing what's happening to the pipeline. So I don't think we're expecting to see we've had a terrific first half of the year in terms of selling this. We're not predicting any decline in the second half as a result of that. We think we're going to continue to see the mid-market being an important source of new business."

It can vary based on the specific geographical distribution of the employers. It can vary based on what kind of planned are coming from, whether they already have a plan that, for example, has high deductibles or what other features they might have already had built into it. Generally, we look at saving between 5% and 15% for the employer. Although often what will happen is the employers will probably give about 2/3 of that back to -- or about 1/3 of that back to the employees and keep about 2/3. So when they make the exchange, it's a win-win for both the employer and employee in terms of the cost aspect to that. That's been something that we've seen since the beginning. We don't -- we're not seeing any change in that overall. I think in terms of growth adoption rate, it's hard to say exactly what -- whether people are distracted by some of these other ACA things. I tend to think that, that's not the case. I think we have seen, as I said, the mid-market pickup. And in fact, if you are thinking about employers that might be distracted more you might think that actually it's the smaller one that have more of those distractions. So I don't think that's what we're really seeing there. I do think we're seeing the natural conservatism of larger organizations continue to be a factor in the marketplace. But we are seeing the smaller ones adopting it somewhat more enthusiastically than they did even a year ago."

And I guess it was last month after Brexit, and went through that. I would say that we really don't have any change in views or necessarily guidance from then to now. When we look at Brexit, I think it's a hodgepodge of both pluses and minuses. And when we look at our overall exposure, for example, in corporate risk and broking, the overall CRB revenue exposure is about 7% of our revenues. So it's not like we see that, that is the biggest deal in the world. If markets were to move from London to elsewhere, it's not clear that we're disadvantaged by that. In fact, we might even be advantaged depending where it were to move to. So I think there's nothing that we see now that we say this is necessarily a problem for us. I mean, I think even at the senior levels of our company, we have different views as to the impact of Brexit overall. Some of us have -- I've been relatively relaxed about the notion of Brexit.

Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016.

Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016. 
We're pleased with our performance this quarter in a business environment that had some challenges. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion, which includes $31 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Adjusted revenues, which include $26 million of deferred revenues, were up 11% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Commissions and fees were up 3% on an organic basis. 
Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $72 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $114 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $401 million or 22.1% of adjusted revenues. The second quarter is the seasonally weak quarter due to the low level of renewals for some lines of business, primarily related to Gras Savoye and Miller, where they had very strong renewals in the first quarter. Portions of the consulting and administration businesses also have weaker performance in the second quarter of the calendar year due to seasonality. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $1,077,000,000 or 25.4% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2015 of $979 million or 25.6% of adjusted revenues. Due to the seasonality quarter-over-quarter, we believe the first half of calendars 2016 is a more meaningful indicator of performance. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.66. 
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergies, cost synergies, and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange, and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 9 global healthcare solution clients, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange. We've won a number of new clients with approximately 70,000 eligible lives for implementations this year and continue to see the pipeline build. To provide some context to the 2017 wins, Willis, acting as our channel partner last year, sold approximately 9,000 lives for all of 2016. 
Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 10 new projects so far this year. We're certainly off to a strong start, but we continue to believe that our revenue synergies will be much more heavily weighted to 2017 and 2018. As we'd mentioned last quarter, most of these wins will not have a significant impact on our 2016 financial results, however, we're very pleased with the progress to date. 
Now moving on to the tax and costs synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We are reaching the estimating merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. As noted last quarter, we plan to save about $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of about $30 million. 
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $97 million from the second quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $16 million of restructuring costs in this same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 and remain committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. OIP continues to be on track. We'll have more detailed information regarding margin impact at our Analyst Day in September. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital and benefits increased 3%, corporate risk and broking increased 9%, investment risk and Reinsurance increased 7% and Exchange Solutions increased 47%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Okay. So now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital and Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 3%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to strong demand in Great Britain, which was offset by the expected decline in the U.S. revenues with the decreased demand for both lump sum project works. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down, as the number of M&A transactions and special projects slowed year-over-year. Health and Benefits services continued to see strong demand and the U.S. large company. And as I mentioned earlier, the Global benefit solution business had strong momentum. 
Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to increased project and call center demand. We continued to have a positive outlook for the HCB business for the rest of 2016. The demand for both lump sum projects and one-time annuity purchases has been picking up, and we expect greater activity in the second half of the calendar year. Talent and Rewards generally has easier comps and a promising data services pipeline. We also continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses. 
Turning to Corporate Risk and Brokering or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 9% from the prior year, largely as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees grew by 1%. 
In North America, commissions and fees were down slightly after a strong first quarter. Retention levels were strong, but we experienced lower levels of new business as compared to last year. 
Great Britain produced solid results as the P&C and financial lines led our growth. The international region had modest growth despite a challenging quarter for both China and Brazil. 
Western Europe had solid organic results given the environment, and Iberia was particularly strong, growing mid-single digits as a result of new business. 
We expect CRB to show growth in the second half of the calendar year. We've seen some slowdown in the emerging markets but generally, we see a good pipeline around the globe even if it is a bit softer than a year ago. While we don't believe the North America new business levels show any secular change in the market, we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
Now to investment risk and reinsurance. Commissions and fees grew 7% for the quarter, driven by the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services, which is performing in line with our acquisition assumptions. Organic commissions and fees declined 4.5%, primarily due to a continued decline in demand for risk consulting projects, lower demand for investment advisory services, lower profit sharing on certain insurance contracts and a slowdown in Capital Markets. 
Capital Markets commissions and fees are closely tied to the number of insurance-related M&A transactions, and we've seen a significant slowdown in transactions year-over-year. Reinsurance commissions and fees were flat as the international market and the specialty business did quite well but new business was soft in North America. We anticipate some growth in the second half of the year as comparables get a bit easier for the IRR segment and we may be seeing a slight increase in demand for Reinsurance due to the recent losses noted by many of the carriers this past quarter. However, we expect most of the market headwinds related to this segment to continue for the rest of the calendar year. 
As discussed in the last earnings call, JLT paid a $40 million settlement in quarter 2 related to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. This settlement was included in IRR's total revenues as other income. This item has not been adjusted out of GAAP earnings, and this is consistent with historic practice. 
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up a strong first quarter with another outstanding quarter, with commissions and fees of $154 million, an increase of 47%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions' segment grew by 43%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenues increased 48% and the other Exchange Solutions business has increased 44% and 36% on an organic basis. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. 
Our health and welfare administration business is growing, primarily as a result of the unprecedented new business won over the last 2 years. 
I'd also like to provide some comments regarding the selling season for the 2017 enrollment period. We had a strong selling season and expect to enroll over 300,000 retirees and active employees onto our exchanges. In the retiree space, a little over 100,000 retirees are expected to enroll for 2017. Now we had a record enrollment last year as a result of the State of Ohio, and we did not anticipate duplicating the 2016 enrollment levels. While we aren't enrolling the retirees of a large state of municipality this year, we continue to feel confident in this market in the long term. However, we would also expect that the enrollments in this market will have some volatility from year-to-year. 
In the active space, we sold approximately 200,000 lives, with 1 client opting to enroll for 2018. We anticipate enrollment growth of approximately 80% to 100% year-over-year. I've previously mentioned the success we've had in the mid-market in the very short time since the merger. I've had one comment in my previous statements regarding the mid-market environment. It appears that the adoption rate in the mid-market has accelerated, and we feel that this is sustainable. We continue to see strong interest from the large market, and we've had some success in winning a few large clients, but the pace of adoption continues to be slower as these organizations are still taking more time to make decisions. We can't predict the inflection point in this market, but the value Exchanges provide to both the employee and employer is quite impactful and we continue to expect the large market to be a significant part of the overall exchange market. We expect the second half will be strong but we will not have any significant off-cycle enrollments this year, so the second half commissions and fees growth rates will be lower than we've seen year-to-date. In the Exchanges Other, we continue to add new administration clients but have strong comparables in the fourth quarter. So we would expect commission and fee growth rates to normalize for this line of business as well. 
I'm encouraged by the quarterly results, the strong collaboration we're experiencing at a grassroots level, the commitment to the integration efforts, including the revenue synergies and of course, the continued focus on our clients. I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their hard work in helping shape this organization for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'd also like to add my thanks to our colleagues for all their hard work. Prior to the merger, in a previous call, I had talked about the unique opportunity we had to create a powerful organization, which would be stronger than what we could have achieved as individual organizations. Now that we're into our eighth month of integration, I'm happy to say that we're seeing clear development of these merger synergy focus areas. We have confirmation that the enhanced global footprint and large market relationships are having a positive impact on our Global Benefit Solutions business. We're seeing some early success in utilizing the U.S. mid-market distribution network for our healthcare exchange, and we've had some early wins in the large market P&C space and our cost rationalization efforts are bearing fruit. There's still a lot of hard work ahead of us, but seeing the collaboration among our colleagues and the market activity make me optimistic that we're creating the powerful organization that we envisioned.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $136 million or 7% of revenues. The prior year second quarter pro forma operating income was $170 million or 9.4% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues. In the prior year quarter, pro forma adjusted operating income was $347 million or 19.2% of adjusted revenues. Income from operations for the first half of 2016 was $462 million or 11% of revenues. The prior year first half pro forma operating income was $553 million or 14.5% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2016 was $1 billion or 23.7% of adjusted revenues and the prior year first half pro forma adjusted operating income was $884 million or 23% of adjusted revenues. 
During the quarter, we recognized a net $6 million currency gain as shown in other nonoperating income. This gain is driven by the reversal of a currency loss recognized on certain balance sheet positions in the first quarter. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21% and the adjusted tax rate was 25%. 
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we've provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. 
For the second quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital and Benefits segment, or HCB, was 15% as compared to pro forma 20% last year. Commission and fee declines in talent rewards and quarterly timing in the mid-market health and benefits business and in incentive costs drove the second quarter margin lower than the prior year. As a reminder, the North America mid-market health and benefits business placed a greater number of their policies in the first quarter this year, depressing the second quarter results. For the first half of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 24% as compared to 26% in 2015. We anticipate the HCB segment margin to be in the low 20% range for the year. 
For the second quarter, the corporate risk and broking segment, or CRB, had a 19% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 22% in the prior year. For the first half of 2016, the CRB operating margin was 19% as compared to 17% last year. As a result of the heavy lift weighting of commissions and fees for Gras Savoye in the first quarter, the seasonality of the quarterly margin has changed as well. We anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The team is focused on balancing the expense base against the current revenue environment in order to drive margin enhancement. 
For the quarter, the investment risk and reinsurance segment, or IRR, had a 25% operating margin. The margin included the $40 million JLT settlement relating to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. Without the legal settlement, IRR's operating margin would have been 17% for the second quarter or flat year-over-year. The increased margin was a result of the legal settlement and the Miller acquisition, which were partially offset by the decline in commissions and fees in the Risk Consulting and Software and investment businesses. Inclusive of the legal settlement, we expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year. 
Exchange Solutions' operating margin was quite strong at 20% as compared to 8% in last year's quarter. For the first half of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions' segment operating margin was 22% as compared to 11% last year. 
For the quarter, the Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with a 45% operating margin, with margins being flat to down for all other lines of business. We continue to invest in the actives exchange. Margin on the administration business is generally soft for several quarters as new clients come on the platform. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions' segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the year due to our enrollment season. Costs build up prior to the open enrollment, but commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, we successfully issued our first public Eurobond of EUR 540 million, 6-year issuance. This transaction completed our debt restructuring plan for the year. A portion of the bond proceeds was used to pay off the remaining balance on the $1 billion term loan facility we entered into in November 2015. 
We also reinitiated our stock buyback program in June. Through August 1, we've repurchased $100 million or approximately 805,000 shares. We anticipate repurchasing another $200 million by the end of December for a total repurchase of $300 million for the 2016 calendar year.
Free cash flow was $265 million this quarter and $335 million for the first half of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016 for Willis Towers Watson. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for integration- and transaction-related items. Our deferred revenue add back adjustments were completed in the June quarter. Integration- and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.
In fiscal '16, we expect reported revenue growth to be around 7% and constant currency revenue growth to be around 10%, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions and the Exchange Solutions' segment. We're bringing organic revenue growth guidance down to a range of 2% to 3%. Although the second quarter organic growth was quite solid at 5% overall and 3% for commissions and fees, we continue to see headwinds and lag where we expect it to be. This new range reflects the market environment we've seen in the first half, with some expectation of slightly improved commission and fee organic growth in the second half due to pockets of improved business momentum and areas of better sequential and year-over-year comparisons. 
We continue to expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 8% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. We believe the various cost-reduction programs underway will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.68. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is down from the previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.95. Guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.38 to the pound and $1.11 to the euro. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the integration efforts, including the early wins that relate to our revenue synergies. The focus on margin growth and our continued progress in streamlining reporting. Now I'll turn it back to John."

I think -- we see some challenges in Talent and Rewards, as I mentioned. And specifically, that is obviously the most economically sensitive of our businesses there and tends to go up and down. As we've seen a cutback on M&A and on some other projects, that has impacted where we are. We don't feel that we're losing out necessarily to the market at all. I just think we see the market as being a little bit slower. We do feel pretty good about -- that we think we'll see a little more of a pick-up there. We have easier comparables, and we also see maybe a slightly improved pipeline for the second half of the year. So while it's down, we don't feel that we're losing any market share, and we feel that we continue to be well positioned there. I think in the Risk Consulting and Software and in the investment part of the business, those are both ones that have seen some challenges in the last couple of years really. And I think we continue to see them undergoing some challenges. Now the Risk Consulting and Software is not one that our major competitors really have, so we don't have any direct comparables there. But we do see a decline in a lot of the risk consulting projects. The software piece of that business is doing relatively well but the consulting part of the business, we're just seeing less of an appetite for that among our clients. And I would say that again, it's not so much that it strikes us that we're losing market share there. It's that we just see the market being softer than it had been. In the investment part of the world, we don't run the funds of funds and so we don't have a direct comparison again to some of our competitors, but we are seeing a decline in some of the consulting projects around that. And so we're seeing more of a focus to some of our delegated investment, which I think was the growth area that we see. But a large part of our business has been consulting, and we do see some softness there. If I look at the rest of the businesses, whether it's legacy Willis or legacy Towers Watson, I think we see some ups and downs. I think, in general, we're within 1% or so of where the market is going, with the -- with maybe an exception of the Exchange Solution, which has just had a fantastic half -- first half of the year."

If we kind of live in a market -- in an environment with a 2% GDP, the 10-year stays around 2%, inflation is kind of constant and the P&C rates stay in this sort of negative -- a couple hundred basis points maybe, is that an environment where you feel confident that you're going to be able to drive towards that 10 10 number in 2018?

So let me just sort of talk about that at an overall level there. I think, as you mentioned, when I was responding to the question about the legacy Towers Watson, I said to the extent we see some areas that are underperforming, we have a sense that it's the market and not so much specific things going there. One of the things that make it a little bit difficult is in some of those areas, like Risk Consulting and Software, we don't have natural competitors that are public companies to look to -- to see what the market is. But our overall sense is just that the market is down there. And we've been through this. We see some ups and downs. We have areas like our old Talent and Rewards that are very heavily dependent on the economy overall. So we see those going on. We have areas -- we have similar areas like that in -- from the legacy Willis part of the business. So when we look at the Capital Markets area there, that's a small area but it's one that is very sensitive to the amount of insurance-related transaction -- M&A transactions that are going on. And for comparison last year, there was $110 billion in M&A transactions in the insurance space. So far this year, there's been $10 billion. That's a pretty big difference, and it's one of the reasons why that has contributed to a decline in the IRR this year. I think when we look at it, there're a couple areas where we are trailing the market. I think if we look at our corporate risk and broking and if we look at the Reinsurance, we're a little bit lower than the market there. I think in both cases, we look at those as it may be, in some cases, a portfolio effect. So for example, I think the international, which has been the real source of growth for Willis versus the market over the last several years, that's the area that's particularly down this year. And so that may affect us more than some of our competitors. But I think it's safe to say that we're probably 1% or so below them this year. We don't see anything that's structural. We think that some of that is related to just some goings on in the business that we expect to reverse themselves. We expect to be growing at about the level of the market or better in 2017."

We were running at, I think for last year or so, a little over 10% in voluntary turnover, and we're actually running just under 10% now, which I used to think in terms of when we were in just the consulting area, whether it was Watson Wyatt or Towers Watson, I used to think of maybe 10% to 12% voluntary turnover rate as being about the right level. And I think there's probably more turnover in the brokerage market generally. So I would have expected that to be somewhat higher. So I think coming in at just under 10, we're at 9.8 or something like that now, is a little bit lower than I'd expected. And so that's what we feel about that overall. When we look at the -- there is obviously seasonality. And so we noticed this in the old Towers Watson days. You get more turnovers after you've just paid bonuses than you do there. We continue to see that. No particular changes there. And I think when we look at specifically where we've had some competitors try to target some of our individuals, one of the things we do is we prioritize those, and we don't necessarily try to respond to every raid on an employee like that. And we target the ones that we think are the real high-value employees. We've been very successful at that and we've continued to hold on to the ones that we really wanted to."

So I don't have right off at my fingertips here, Mark, the relative numbers for the second half, but the mid-market is different than the large market in that you can continue to have sales that occur up until almost to the November time frame in term -- and still implement them. But by far, the bulk of it will occur in the first half. So I don't have all at my fingertips, whether it's like 80% occurs in the first half or it's probably something like that. But we'll get you those numbers. I would think it's safe to say though that the bulk of the sales have already occurred by far, although there will be some continuing. I think -- I made a comment in the script to say that we look at the mid-market as saying that it's accelerated and that we feel that that's sustainable. So that's based on our talking with clients, our seeing what's happening to the pipeline. So I don't think we're expecting to see -- we've had a terrific first half of the year in terms of selling this. We're not predicting any decline in the second half as a result of that. We think we're going to continue to see the mid-market being an important source of new business."

It can vary based on the specific geographical distribution of the employers. It can vary based on what kind of plan they're coming from, whether they already had a plan that, for example, had high deductibles or what other features they might have already had built into it. Generally, we look at saving between 5% and 15% for the employer. Although often what will happen is the employers will probably give about 2/3 of that back to -- or about 1/3 of that back to the employees and keep about 2/3. So when they make the exchange, it's a win-win for both the employer and the employee in terms of the cost aspect to that. That's been something that we've seen since the beginning and we don't -- we're not seeing any change in that overall. I think in terms of the adoption rate, it's hard to say exactly what -- whether people are distracted by some of these other ACA things. I tend to think that that's not the case. I think we have seen, as I said, the mid-market pickup. And in fact, if you are thinking about employers that might be distracted more you might think that actually, it's the smaller ones that have more of those distractions. So I don't think that's what we're really seeing there. I do think we're seeing the natural conservatism of larger organizations continue to be a factor in the marketplace. But we are seeing the smaller ones adopting it somewhat more enthusiastically than they did even a year ago."

And I guess it was last month after Brexit, and went through that. I would say that we really don't have any change in views or necessarily guidance from then to now. When we look at Brexit, I think it's a hodgepodge of both pluses and minuses. And when we look at our overall exposure, for example, in corporate risk and broking, the overall CRB revenue exposure is about 7% of our revenues. So it's not like we see that, that is the biggest deal in the world. If markets were to move from London to elsewhere, it's not clear that we're disadvantaged by that. In fact, we might even be advantaged depending on where it was to move to. So I think there's nothing that we see now that we say this is necessarily a problem for us. I mean, I think even at the senior levels of our company, we have different views as to the impact of Brexit overall. Some of us have -- I've been relatively relaxed about the notion of Brexit. Some other people are more concerned about that. But I think overall, we don't see the movement of the B or V today isn't anything that was unexpected, and I don't think it changes our overall guidance."

Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment res",1920,"Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016. 
We're pleased with our performance this quarter in a business environment that had some challenges. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion, which includes $31 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Adjusted revenues, which include $26 million of deferred revenues, were up 11% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Commissions and fees were up 3% on an organic basis. 
Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $72 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $114 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $401 million or 22.1% of adjusted revenues. The second quarter is the seasonally weak quarter due to the low level of renewals for some lines of business, primarily related to Gras Savoye and Miller, where they had very strong renewals in the first quarter. Portions of the consulting and administration businesses also have weaker performance in the second quarter of the calendar year due to seasonality. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $1,077,000,000 or 25.4% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2015 of $979 million or 25.6% of adjusted revenues. Due to the seasonality quarter-over-quarter, we believe the first half of calendars 2016 is a more meaningful indicator of performance. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $0.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.66. 
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: Revenue synergies, cost synergies, and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We're making very good inroads in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange, and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another 9 global healthcare solution clients, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. 
Turning to the mid-market exchange. We've won a number of new clients with approximately 70,000 eligible lives for implementations this year and continue to see the pipeline build. To provide some context to the 2017 wins, Willis, acting as our channel partner last year, sold approximately 9,000 lives for all of 2016. 
Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 10 new projects so far this year. We're certainly off to a strong start, but we continue to believe that our revenue synergies will be much more heavily weighted to 2017 and 2018. As we'd mentioned last quarter, most of these wins will not have a significant impact on our 2016 financial results, however, we're very pleased with the progress to date. 
Now moving on to the tax and costs synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We are reaching the estimating merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. As noted last quarter, we plan to save about $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of about $30 million. 
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $97 million from the second quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $16 million of restructuring costs in this same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 and remain committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. OIP continues to be on track. We'll have more detailed information regarding margin impact at our Analyst Day in September. 
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital and benefits increased 3%, corporate risk and broking increased 9%, investment risk and Reinsurance increased 7% and Exchange Solutions increased 47%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Okay. So now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital and Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 3%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to strong demand in Great Britain, which was offset by the expected decline in the U.S. revenues with the decreased demand for both lump sum project works. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down, as the number of M&A transactions and special projects slowed year-over-year. Health and Benefits services continued to see strong demand and the U.S. large company. And as I mentioned earlier, the Global benefit solution business had strong momentum. 
Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to increased project and call center demand. We continued to have a positive outlook for the HCB business for the rest of 2016. The demand for both lump sum projects and one-time annuity purchases has been picking up, and we expect greater activity in the second half of the calendar year. Talent and Rewards generally has easier comps and a promising data services pipeline. We also continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses. 
Turning to Corporate Risk and Brokering or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 9% from the prior year, largely as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees grew by 1%. 
In North America, commissions and fees were down slightly after a strong first quarter. Retention levels were strong, but we experienced lower levels of new business as compared to last year. 
Great Britain produced solid results as the P&C and financial lines led our growth. The international region had modest growth despite a challenging quarter for both China and Brazil. 
Western Europe had solid organic results given the environment, and Iberia was particularly strong, growing mid-single digits as a result of new business. 
We expect CRB to show growth in the second half of the calendar year. We've seen some slowdown in the emerging markets but generally, we see a good pipeline around the globe even if it is a bit softer than a year ago. While we don't believe the North America new business levels show any secular change in the market, we'll continue to monitor this closely. 
Now to investment risk and reinsurance. Commissions and fees grew 7% for the quarter, driven by the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services, which is performing in line with our acquisition assumptions. Organic commissions and fees declined 4.5%, primarily due to a continued decline in demand for risk consulting projects, lower demand for investment advisory services, lower profit sharing on certain insurance contracts and a slowdown in Capital Markets. 
Capital Markets commissions and fees are closely tied to the number of insurance-related M&A transactions, and we've seen a significant slowdown in transactions year-over-year. Reinsurance commissions and fees were flat as the international market and the specialty business did quite well but new business was soft in North America. We anticipate some growth in the second half of the year as comparables get a bit easier for the IRR segment and we may be seeing a slight increase in demand for Reinsurance due to the recent losses noted by many of the carriers this past quarter. However, we expect most of the market headwinds related to this segment to continue for the rest of the calendar year. 
As discussed in the last earnings call, JLT paid a $40 million settlement in quarter 2 related to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. This settlement was included in IRR's total revenues as other income. This item has not been adjusted out of GAAP earnings, and this is consistent with historic practice. 
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up a strong first quarter with another outstanding quarter, with commissions and fees of $154 million, an increase of 47%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions' segment grew by 43%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenues increased 48% and the other Exchange Solutions business has increased 44% and 36% on an organic basis. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. 
Our health and welfare administration business is growing, primarily as a result of the unprecedented new business won over the last 2 years. 
I'd also like to provide some comments regarding the selling season for the 2017 enrollment period. We had a strong selling season and expect to enroll over 300,000 retirees and active employees onto our exchanges. In the retiree space, a little over 100,000 retirees are expected to enroll for 2017. Now we had a record enrollment last year as a result of the State of Ohio, and we did not anticipate duplicating the 2016 enrollment levels. While we aren't enrolling the retirees of a large state of municipality this year, we continue to feel confident in this market in the long term. However, we would also expect that the enrollments in this market will have some volatility from year-to-year. 
In the active space, we sold approximately 200,000 lives, with 1 client opting to enroll for 2018. We anticipate enrollment growth of approximately 80% to 100% year-over-year. I've previously mentioned the success we've had in the mid-market in the very short time since the merger. I've had one comment in my previous statements regarding the mid-market environment. It appears that the adoption rate in the mid-market has accelerated, and we feel that this is sustainable. We continue to see strong interest from the large market, and we've had some success in winning a few large clients, but the pace of adoption continues to be slower as these organizations are still taking more time to make decisions. We can't predict the inflection point in this market, but the value Exchanges provide to both the employee and employer is quite impactful and we continue to expect the large market to be a significant part of the overall exchange market. We expect the second half will be strong but we will not have any significant off-cycle enrollments this year, so the second half commissions and fees growth rates will be lower than we've seen year-to-date. In the Exchanges Other, we continue to add new administration clients but have strong comparables in the fourth quarter. So we would expect commission and fee growth rates to normalize for this line of business as well. 
I'm encouraged by the quarterly results, the strong collaboration we're experiencing at a grassroots level, the commitment to the integration efforts, including the revenue synergies and of course, the continued focus on our clients. I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their hard work in helping shape this organization for long-term success. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

We're seeing some early success in utilizing the U.S. mid-market distribution network for our healthcare exchange, and we've had some early wins in the large market P&C space and our cost rationalization efforts are bearing fruit. There's still a lot of hard work ahead of us, but seeing the collaboration among our colleagues and the market activity make me optimistic that we're creating the powerful organization that we envisioned.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. 
Income from operations for the quarter was $136 million or 7% of revenues. The prior year second quarter pro forma operating income was $170 million or 9.4% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues. In the prior year quarter, pro forma adjusted operating income was $347 million or 19.2% of adjusted revenues. Income from operations for the first half of 2016 was $462 million or 11% of revenues. The prior year first half pro forma operating income was $553 million or 14.5% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2016 was $1 billion or 23.7% of adjusted revenues and the prior year first half pro forma adjusted operating income was $884 million or 23% of adjusted revenues. 
During the quarter, we recognized a net $6 million currency gain as shown in other nonoperating income. This gain is driven by the reversal of a currency loss recognized on certain balance sheet positions in the first quarter. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21% and the adjusted tax rate was 25%. 
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we've provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. 
For the second quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital and Benefits segment, or HCB, was 15% as compared to pro forma 20% last year. Commission and fee declines in talent rewards and quarterly timing in the mid-market health and benefits business and in incentive costs drove the second quarter margin lower than the prior year. As a reminder, the North America mid-market health and benefits business placed a greater number of their policies in the first quarter this year, depressing the second quarter results. For the first half of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 24% as compared to 26% in 2015. We anticipate the HCB segment margin to be in the low 20% range for the year. 
For the second quarter, the corporate risk and broking segment, or CRB, had a 19% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 22% in the prior year. For the first half of 2016, the CRB operating margin was 19% as compared to 17% last year. As a result of the heavy lift weighting of commissions and fees for Gras Savoye in the first quarter, the seasonality of the quarterly margin has changed as well. We anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The team is focused on balancing the expense base against the current revenue environment in order to drive margin enhancement. 
For the quarter, the investment risk and reinsurance segment, or IRR, had a 25% operating margin. The margin included the $40 million JLT settlement relating to the fine arts and jewelry team departure. Without the legal settlement, IRR's operating margin would have been 17% for the second quarter or flat year-over-year. The increased margin was a result of the legal settlement and the Miller acquisition, which were partially offset by the decline in commissions and fees in the Risk Consulting and Software and investment businesses. Inclusive of the legal settlement, we expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year. 
Exchange Solutions' operating margin was quite strong at 20% as compared to 8% in last year's quarter. For the first half of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions' segment operating margin was 22% as compared to 11% last year. 
For the quarter, the Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with a 45% operating margin, with margins being flat to down for all other lines of business. We continue to invest in the actives exchange. Margin on the administration business is generally soft for several quarters as new clients come on the platform. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions' segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the year due to our enrollment season. Costs build up prior to the open enrollment, but commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, we successfully issued our first public Eurobond of EUR 540 million, 6-year issuance. This transaction completed our debt restructuring plan for the year. A portion of the bond proceeds was used to pay off the remaining balance on the $1 billion term loan facility we entered into in November 2015. 
We also reinitiated our stock buyback program in June. Through August 1, we've repurchased $100 million or approximately 805,000 shares. We anticipate repurchasing another $200 million by the end of December for a total repurchase of $300 million for the 2016 calendar year.
Free cash flow was $265 million this quarter and $335 million for the first half of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. 
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016 for Willis Towers Watson. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for integration- and transaction-related items. Our deferred revenue add back adjustments were completed in the June quarter. Integration- and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.
In fiscal '16, we expect reported revenue growth to be around 7% and constant currency revenue growth to be around 10%, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions and the Exchange Solutions' segment. We're bringing organic revenue growth guidance down to a range of 2% to 3%. Although the second quarter organic growth was quite solid at 5% overall and 3% for commissions and fees, we continue to see headwinds and lag where we expect it to be. This new range reflects the market environment we've seen in the first half, with some expectation of slightly improved commission and fee organic growth in the second half due to pockets of improved business momentum and areas of better sequential and year-over-year comparisons. 
We continue to expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 8% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. We believe the various cost-reduction programs underway will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.68. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is down from the previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.95. Guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.38 to the pound and $1.11 to the euro. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the integration efforts, including the early wins that relate to our revenue synergies. The focus on margin growth and our continued progress in streamlining reporting. Now I'll turn it back to John."

I think -- we see some challenges in Talent and Rewards, as I mentioned. And specifically, that is obviously the most economically sensitive of our businesses there and tends to go up and down. As we've seen a cutback on M&A and on some other projects, that has impacted where we are. We don't feel that we're losing out necessarily to the market at all. I just think we see the market as being a little bit slower. We do feel pretty good about -- that we think we'll see a little more of a pick-up there. We have easier comparables, and we also see maybe a slightly improved pipeline for the second half of the year. So while it's down, we don't feel that we're losing any market share, and we feel that we continue to be well positioned there. I think in the Risk Consulting and Software and in the investment part of the business, those are both ones that have seen some challenges in the last couple of years really. And I think we continue to see them undergoing some challenges. Now the Risk Consulting and Software is not one that our major competitors really have, so we don't have any direct comparables there. But we do see a decline in a lot of the risk consulting projects. The software piece of that business is doing relatively well but the consulting part of the business, we're just seeing less of an appetite for that among our clients. And I would say that again, it's not so much that it strikes us that we're losing market share there. It's that we just see the market being softer than it had been. In the investment part of the world, we don't run the funds of funds and so we don't have a direct comparison again to some of our competitors, but we are seeing a decline in some of the consulting projects around that. And so we're seeing more of a focus to some of our delegated investment, which I think was the growth area that we see. But a large part of our business has been consulting, and we do see some softness there. If I look at the rest of the businesses, whether it's legacy Willis or legacy Towers Watson, I think we see some ups and downs. I think, in general, we're within 1% or so of where the market is going, with the -- with maybe an exception of the Exchange Solution, which has just had a fantastic half -- first half of the year."

But can you just kind of go into more detail, I guess, on what outside of just those 2 acquisitions is really driving the margin deterioration? And how, I guess, you expect that to kind of flip as you move -- now expect margin improvement in the back half of the year and as you go towards that 25% target?"

If we kind of live in a market -- in an environment with a 2% GDP, the 10-year stays around 2%, inflation is kind of constant and the P&C rates stay in this sort of negative -- a couple hundred basis points maybe, is that an environment where you feel confident that you're going to be able to drive towards that 10 10 number in 2018?

So let me just sort of talk about that at an overall level there. I think, as you mentioned, when I was responding to the question about the legacy Towers Watson, I said to the extent we see some areas that are underperforming, we have a sense that it's the market and not so much specific things going there. One of the things that make it a little bit difficult is in some of those areas, like Risk Consulting and Software, we don't have natural competitors that are public companies to look to -- to see what the market is. But our overall sense is just that the market is down there. And we've been through this. We see some ups and downs. We have areas like our old Talent and Rewards that are very heavily dependent on the economy overall. So we see those going on. We have areas -- we have similar areas like that in -- from the legacy Willis part of the business. So when we look at the Capital Markets area there, that's a small area but it's one that is very sensitive to the amount of insurance-related transaction -- M&A transactions that are going on. And for comparison last year, there was $110 billion in M&A transactions in the insurance space. So far this year, there's been $10 billion. That's a pretty big difference, and it's one of the reasons why that has contributed to a decline in the IRR this year. I think when we look at it, there're a couple areas where we are trailing the market. I think if we look at our corporate risk and broking and if we look at the Reinsurance, we're a little bit lower than the market there. I think in both cases, we look at those as it may be, in some cases, a portfolio effect. So for example, I think the international, which has been the real source of growth for Willis versus the market over the last several years, that's the area that's particularly down this year. And so that may affect us more than some of our competitors. But I think it's safe to say that we're probably 1% or so below them this year. We don't see anything that's structural. We think that some of that is related to just some goings on in the business that we expect to reverse themselves. We expect to be growing at about the level of the market or better in 2017."

So I think overall, the -- frankly, the turnover has been lower than I would have expected.  We were running at, I think for last year or so, a little over 10% in voluntary turnover, and we're actually running just under 10% now, which I used to think in terms of when we were in just the consulting area, whether it was Watson Wyatt or Towers Watson, I used to think of maybe 10% to 12% voluntary turnover rate as being about the right level. And I think there's probably more turnover in the brokerage market generally. So I would have expected that to be somewhat higher. So I think coming in at just under 10, we're at 9.8 or something like that now, is a little bit lower than I'd expected. And so that's what we feel about that overall. When we look at the -- there is obviously seasonality. And so we noticed this in the old Towers Watson days. You get more turnovers after you've just paid bonuses than you do there. We continue to see that. No particular changes there. And I think when we look at specifically where we've had some competitors try to target some of our individuals, one of the things we do is we prioritize those, and we don't necessarily try to respond to every raid on an employee like that. And we target the ones that we think are the real high-value employees. We've been very successful at that and we've continued to hold on to the ones that we really wanted to."

So I don't have right off at my fingertips here, Mark, the relative numbers for the second half, but the mid-market is different than the large market in that you can continue to have sales that occur up until almost to the November time frame in term -- and still implement them. But by far, the bulk of it will occur in the first half. So I don't have all at my fingertips, whether it's like 80% occurs in the first half or it's probably something like that. But we'll get you those numbers. I would think it's safe to say though that the bulk of the sales have already occurred by far, although there will be some continuing. I think -- I made a comment in the script to say that we look at the mid-market as saying that it's accelerated and that we feel that that's sustainable. So that's based on our talking with clients, our seeing what's happening to the pipeline. So I don't think we're expecting to see -- we've had a terrific first half of the year in terms of selling this. We're not predicting any decline in the second half as a result of that. We think we're going to continue to see the mid-market being an important source of new business."

It can vary based on the specific geographical distribution of the employers. It can vary based on what kind of plan they're coming from, whether they already had a plan that, for example, had high deductibles or what other features they might have already had built into it. Generally, we look at saving between 5% and 15% for the employer. Although often what will happen is the employers will probably give about 2/3 of that back to -- or about 1/3 of that back to the employees and keep about 2/3. So when they make the exchange, it's a win-win for both the employer and the employee in terms of the cost aspect to that. That's been something that we've seen since the beginning and we don't -- we're not seeing any change in that overall. I think in terms of the adoption rate, it's hard to say exactly what -- whether people are distracted by some of these other ACA things. I tend to think that that's not the case. I think we have seen, as I said, the mid-market pickup. And in fact, if you are thinking about employers that might be distracted more you might think that actually, it's the smaller ones that have more of those distractions. So I don't think that's what we're really seeing there. I do think we're seeing the natural conservatism of larger organizations continue to be a factor in the marketplace. But we are seeing the smaller ones adopting it somewhat more enthusiastically than they did even a year ago."

And I guess it was last month after Brexit, and went through that. I would say that we really don't have any change in views or necessarily guidance from then to now. When we look at Brexit, I think it's a hodgepodge of both pluses and minuses. And when we look at our overall exposure, for example, in corporate risk and broking, the overall CRB revenue exposure is about 7% of our revenues. So it's not like we see that, that is the biggest deal in the world. If markets were to move from London to elsewhere, it's not clear that we're disadvantaged by that. In fact, we might even be advantaged depending on where it was to move to. So I think there's nothing that we see now that we say this is necessarily a problem for us. I mean, I think even at the senior levels of our company, we have different views as to the impact of Brexit overall. Some of us have -- I've been relatively relaxed about the notion of Brexit. Some other people are more concerned about that. But I think overall, we don't see the movement of the B or V today isn't anything that was unexpected, and I don't think it changes our overall guidance."

Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.
Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.
I'd like to take a few minutes to address the management changes we announced last week. First, I'd like to thank Dominic Casserley for his contributions to Willis and all of his efforts in assisting in the creation of Willis Towers Watson. Dominic has been a terrific partner throughout the entire transaction and integration process. Second, I'm extremely pleased with the appointments we've made to the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance and the Corporate Risk & Broking businesses and to the Americas region. Not only have we enhanced the Operating Committee by increasing the strength of the brokerage perspective, but I'm very excited about bringing the vision and passion Carl Hess, Todd Jones and Joe Gunn bring to their new roles. I'm confident that based on their previous success and the depth of their knowledge of our business, they'll continue to be strong and effective leaders.
Now let's turn to our results for the quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.78 billion, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. This includes $51 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Commissions and fees for the reportable segments were up 2% on an organic basis.
The net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $32 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $209 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $275 million or 15.5% of revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $307 million or 17.6% of revenues. The year-over-year decline is due to revenue pressure from CRB and IRR and the seasonality of the Gras Savoye business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.35 billion or 22.5% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2015 of $1.27 billion or 22.8% of adjusted revenues.
For the quarter, loss per diluted share was $0.23, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04. Currency fluctuations, net of hedging, had a negative impact of $0.02 on adjusted EPS.
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. In the first year, we expected to achieve sales of approximately 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergies. We are where we want to be, but we also realize that achieving our first year goals is a small portion of our overall objective and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we've discussed on previous calls, the global health solutions and mid-market revenues will primarily be recognized in 2017. The majority of the P&C wins will also impact 2017 and beyond.
We're continuing to make good progress in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: global health care solutions, the mid-market health care exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector.
We've won another 6 global health care solution clients this quarter, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. We also won 30 single-country multinational assignments.
Turning to the mid-market exchange. As previously discussed, we sold approximately 70,000 eligible lives for the 2017 enrollment. We may see a pause in sales activity while the enrollment season is underway but continue to be pleased with our 2018 sales pipeline. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 16 new projects so far this year.
Now moving on to the tax and cost synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule, in fact. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term.
We originally estimated merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. We continue to estimate savings of approximately $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of at least $30 million.
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from OIP were approximately $14 million from the third quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $11 million of restructuring costs in the same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 for restructuring charges.
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%, Corporate Risk & Broking increased 8%, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance decreased 5% and Exchange Solutions increased 25%. All of the revenue results discussed in this segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.
Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 5%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees increased 2%. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to increased bulk lump sum project work in the U.S. and new pension administration client implementations, which were offset by softness in the Netherlands. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up as a result of strong demand for executive compensation work and the delivery of data surveys. But we continue to experience softness in the Rewards, Talent and Communication business in North America and EMEA.
Moving to health and benefits. We continue to see strong demand in the large company space globally, with strong product and planned management activity in North America. Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to new clients and higher call center demand.
We continue to have a positive outlook for HCB business for the rest of 2016. We should continue to see both lump sum projects in the fourth quarter. Talent and Rewards is seasonally stronger in the second half of the calendar year, and we continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses.
Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 8% from the prior year as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Revenue declines in North America and in the international business offset the growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. In North America, a onetime project in 2015 created a strong comparable, and our new business was lower than expected. China and Brazil accounted for most of the revenue declines in our international business as a result of the economic and political climate in those countries. Great Britain had very strong results across all lines of business, and Iberia led the growth for Western Europe, with some weakness in Denmark and with the affinity business.
We expect Great Britain and Western Europe to continue providing revenue growth, and we don't see any significant near-term changes in the Asian and Latin American markets. We're seeing a small pricing headwind in the North American market and continue to focus on building our new business pipeline. Overall, we expect similar results in the fourth quarter.
Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Commissions and fees were down by 5% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 5%, primarily due to a decline in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets business. The decline in North American reinsurance revenues offset the revenue growth in the other regions. The Capital Markets business, which is generally volatile and is dependent on transactions, generated its highest revenue ever in the third quarter of calendar year '15 and had nominal revenue this quarter. So while the business is rather small to our portfolio, the volatility had a material impact on the growth of the segment.
On a positive note, we continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Risk Consulting had modest revenue growth, led by software sales, and Investment had a very strong quarter as a result of increased performance fees and a soft comparable in the third quarter of '15. We anticipate that IRR will continue to see headwinds in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets businesses as we don't expect the overall environment to change by the end of the calendar year.
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first half with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $161 million, an increase of 25%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchanges revenue increased 35%, and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 14%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. Our Health and Welfare administration business continues to grow, primarily as a result of the new business we've won over the last 2 years.
We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from retirees, where 95% feel they selected the right plans to best meet their needs, and we have an overall 93% retiree satisfaction rate. We've also experienced 100% renewal as our first round of active exchange client contracts were ending this year.
We expect the fourth quarter revenue growth to be more moderate as the retiree and health and welfare businesses start to overlap the strong enrollment numbers and new clients, which were added in the fourth quarter of calendar year '15, which created a strong comparable.
I'm pleased with the progress on a number of initiatives associated with the merger, especially the focus on revenue synergies. We're even seeing crossover in marketing efforts we did not contemplate as we created Willis Towers Watson and remain committed to continue to support and encourage these activities. In order to provide the investments needed to attain our growth goals, we're taking steps to help ensure we achieve our merger commitments of enhanced margins and shareholder return. We're extremely focused on balancing our growth initiative while maintaining financial discipline. I feel we have the right team in place to deliver the 2017 objectives and beyond.
And last, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their enthusiasm in supporting our efforts and their continued steadfast commitments to our clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.
Income from operations for the quarter was $1 million or 0.1% of revenues. The prior year third quarter pro forma operating income was $104 million or 5.9% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $243 million or 13.7% of revenues, and the prior year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $267 million or 15.3% of revenues. As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the third quarter margin.
Income from operations for the first 9 months of 2016 was $463 million or 7.8% of revenues. The prior year first 9 months pro forma operating income was $632 million or 11.3% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.25 billion or 20.7% of adjusted revenues, and the prior year first 9 months pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.13 billion or 20.3% of revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 46%, and the adjusted tax rate was 22%.
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.
For the third quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment, or HCB, was 16% as compared to pro forma 17% last year. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the company average.
For the first 9 months of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 22% as compared to pro forma 23% in 2015. We continue to anticipate the HCB segment operating margin will be in the low 20% range for the year.
For the third quarter, the Corporate Risk & Broking segment, or CRB, had an 11% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 14% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. Revenue pressure from North America and the international business impacted margin. The heavy weighting of Gras Savoye in the first quarter has also changed the seasonality of the quarterly margin. For the first 9 months, the operating margins for 2016 and pro forma for 2015 were 16%. We continue to anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The change in leadership has not impacted the focus to drive margin enhancement.
For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment, or IRR, had an 8% operating margin as compared to pro forma 10% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. The revenue pressure from Capital Markets and Reinsurance was generally offset by growth in Wholesale, Risk Consulting and Investment. For the first 9 months of 2016, the IRR segment operating margin was 26% as compared to pro forma 25% in 2015. Inclusive of the JLT legal settlement, we continue to expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.
Exchange Solutions' operating margin for the quarter and the prior year pro forma was 12%. For the first 9 months of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 18% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year. For the quarter, retiree and access exchanges led the segment with a 27% operating margin as we continue to invest in the active exchange.
For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year due to cost buildup for the enrollment season. Commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As of September 30, we had repurchased $233 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. We continue to anticipate a total repurchase of $300 million for 2016.
Free cash flow was $122 million this quarter and $457 million for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. We still expect to deliver approximately $650 million in free cash flow for 2016.
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for both integration and transaction-related items and restructuring items. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures. In fiscal '16, we're adjusting the expected reported revenue growth to be around 6% and constant currency revenue growth to be in the 9% to 10% range, with the primary growth drivers being the Gras Savoye acquisition and the Exchange Solutions segment. Last quarter, we estimated that organic revenue growth would be in the 2% to 3% range. Based on the third quarter results, we now expect organic revenue growth to be around 2%. 
We expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 7% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5%, and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
We're progressing with various cost-reduction programs, which will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. And we believe that we're beginning to realize the results of this cost control work. While costs can ebb and flow and it can be difficult to fully lock down sequential organic momentum, we believe we saw a modest net sequential enterprise expense reduction in Q2 and that we enhanced the level of sequential reduction in the third quarter versus the second. Assuming continued organic revenue growth, this is the path to margin expansion momentum in 2017.
On a segment basis, we're holding margin estimates to previously reported estimates for all segments. For revenue guidance, we'll be referring to organic commissions and fees. Based on the third quarter results, we're maintaining low single-digit revenue growth for HCB, lowering CRB revenue estimates from low single-digit growth to flat, lowering IRR revenue estimates from a low single-digit decline to a mid-single-digit decline and, finally, increasing Exchange Solutions' revenue growth from high 20s to around 30%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 5% to 7%, and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 23%. We expected GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is in line with our previous guidance. While our financial results this year haven't been as strong as we hoped, this adjusted EPS range represents upper-teens percentage growth over the merger pro forma for 2015. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro.
I continue to be pleased with the integration efforts. While we're seeing early signs of success in areas like reducing the tax rate, winning projects aligned to our revenue synergies and a greater focus on margin management, many of these initiatives are building the foundation for 2017 and beyond. I remain confident in achieving our long-term success.
Now I'll turn it back to John."

We see those things as being -- turning around somewhat next year. I think we had tough comparables on the international, for example, last year. We had some reversals of some income that we had booked in 2015 that occurred this year, that we have going on. I think we -- when we said what we were going to try to do this year, it was, first, we were going to try to make sure we got the right kind of margins, and then we were going to use that to a platform to build with profitable revenue growth. I think that's still been our focus. We feel pretty good about coming in at exactly what we had said last quarter with the EPS. We might be 1% or so lower on the -- or at the bottom end of the revenue guidance that we gave last quarter. But we still feel we'll come in right around there. I think with the new team we have in place, too, I think one of the things I like about that, with some strong brokerage representation for North America leading both CRB and the Americas geography, I think we're well poised to turn around North America there. So I do feel like we have the right people there, we have the right offerings, and I think we just need to build on that."

As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio. But in this particular quarter, best quarter ever in the third quarter of 2015. And nominal revenue is really -- I mean, it was pretty close to 0. So it was really quite nominal revenue for this year. And it reflects the fact that there's just been a dearth of deals in the insurance business generally. And so we're not expecting to see, for example, that to pick back up in the fourth quarter, although we do see some signs that 2017 -- I mean, we have had a couple of wins recently that could very well deliver some nice revenue in 2017. So we'll have to see about that. Reinsurance, we have a -- we are facing some headwinds in reinsurance. We -- our facultative reinsurance, of course, is off in CRB. So we don't report that with our -- in IRR. And that's the part of the business that's been growing more than the 3. But -- so we see that business is still facing some headwinds. I think some of restructurings that our clients have done and some of the just withdrawal of reinsurance from the market, as you've seen some big mergers, have also contributed to headwinds for us there. So again, we're not projecting that the fourth quarter is going to be a big improvement there either. I think some of the other businesses, Investment, which has been down for a number of quarters here, we saw some real improvement in the third quarter, and I think we feel better about the fourth quarter now than we would have a quarter or so ago. And I think we're beginning to see some signs in the Risk Consulting and Software of a bit of a pickup. So it's a mixed bag, but I think the -- I think we continue to see pressure on Reinsurance, and we continue to see Capital Markets as being down. And I think, overall, that's what contributes to a lower forecast for the fourth quarter for that segment."

But what really we challenged ourselves to do this quarter was step back and say, ""Do we start to see the seeds of momentum shift towards our margin expansion goal?"" And while we're still in this period of, one, having comparison to big acquisition periods, so that makes it a little difficult on a comparison side. And so the comparisons aren't really apples and apples year-over-year. But we took a look sequentially at what we saw in the numbers, and given the actions we know we've taken this year, the path to margin expansion is continuing the kind of growth as we've had this year, albeit at a low level. And then sequentially costs are going down, the way margin enhancement pops is you get to a quarter where you're comparing to a year where you began the cost reductions and revenues have been growing through that period, and the margin enhancement pops. And so the only point I was trying to make is -- and again, with a lot of kind of noise in the system and you have to adjust for things that are seasonal in nature, but we believe that we see a sequential cost reduction momentum, which means that when we start comparing next year to 2016, that we would expect to see margin enhancement. So I didn't mean anything particular by citing organic growth, just saying that's the calculation."

In terms of getting -- where we are right now and getting to the end of the year and having a material impact on margins, I don't think those adjustments are at that level. And I guess the other thing, just in terms of the way the accounting works that I'd observed is that the -- what we called in Towers Watson discretionary compensation, which was a quite material item financially relative to a total year, it's not as material for Willis Towers Watson because there are more separate sales compensation programs in Willis Towers Watson. So anyway, long and the short is just pure kind of bonus, not as impactful as Towers Watson was.

And so we've seen that occur partly because people are buying less reinsurance, partly because mergers have actually just taken -- just cut the market in total. And then we've also seen -- we've had a couple of clients that have restructured things, some of the reinsurance programs, which have led to revenues being shifted to different years. And we've seen that on a couple of big ones that have had a material impact on our results. When we look at it overall, the Reinsurance is -- it does tend to be a little lumpy from year-to-year when we compare our results to -- I'd looked at -- we were looking at one of our big competitors the other day, and they were minus 4% last year and they're plus 1% this year. And so we were -- we had a better 2015 and a little bit lower 2016. I think we tend to look maybe at a little bit longer trends than just a year or so. But when we look at it, we fundamentally are encouraged by the fact that the new business efforts have been strong even in North America, and in fact, it exceeded targets. And that's what makes us think that we -- going into 2017, we're well placed."

And at that time, it included both Risk Consulting and Software and our -- the Reinsurance business that we had at Towers Watson. So Karl has some background in all 3 of those areas. I think the background he has in investment will serve him well in understanding the Capital Markets part of the business also. Karl's one of the smartest people we have in the organization, and I think he'll be a quick study on the other parts of the business, too. So we like his background. We like the fact that he has been involved with delivering high revenue growth in the areas he's been in, and he understands the importance of generating profitable revenue growth. Said he was, I think, a very good fit for that. In terms of CRB and North America, as I mentioned in the script, one of the things that I thought we needed more of a perspective on at the Operating Committee was the -- our brokers. And by moving Todd, who has a brokerage background, and then putting Joe Gunn in charge of North America, we have increased some of that perspective on the operating committee. And I think that will be very helpful. Both Todd and Joe, I think, are hardcharging folks who understand what we need to do to build up the Brokerage business in North America, and I think that's going to be one of their key focuses in the short run. And as I said earlier, I do think that this is a business that we probably have overcomplicated or structured a little bit, and I do think some streamlining is probably called for."

But we are on track for the savings, and the savings are realized. There is a very disciplined process to track, both the exits as well as then how that relates to the additional folks that are added in Mumbai or elsewhere in the service centers. So those costs are ""dropping"" to the bottom line. Of course, as a result of both the shortfall in revenues versus what we expected and the plans that had been built for the year relative to that business momentum, that has certainly challenged our ability to show kind of net margin expansion as a result of the savings that are going on, which is really why I wanted to highlight that sequential cost momentum item that I talked about in my script. So while, right now, you see in the adjusted operating margin a little bit of increase, it's not at all what you would expect based on the savings we're seeing in OIP plus merger. But we have been adjusting our expense levels all year as the year went by. And we're now starting to see the results of that. In this 2017 planning period, we continue to emphasize that. So we have our eye on the prize, and we think we're starting to see the kinds of results financially that will lead to margin expansion, but we're not seeing it yet."

I think that -- and it's why we cite the shortfall, the revenues. I think there are areas in the company, I would say, specifically, the legacy Willis International business, where there had been tremendous success, I guess, over the last few years at least, in growing revenues organically. Certainly, as they targeted that and anticipated that it would continue, they did have plans of continuing to add resources and invest relative to that momentum. It certainly has halted here this year. So we have been in the process of both pulling back what had been identified, let's say, as targeted investment initiatives but also pulling back the momentum of cost growth relative to prior organic growth momentum. So it's been a major discussion item. Again, it's a major planning item. And we're pushing that hard to make sure that where we are investing, it's in places where there's good visibility of getting a payback. If there isn't, then we're not going to do it."

Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.
Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.
I'd like to take a few minutes to address the management changes we announced last week. First, I'd like to thank Dominic Casserley for his contributions to Willis and all of his efforts in assisting in the creation of Willis Towers Watson. Dominic has been a terrific partner throughout the entire transaction and integration process. Second, I'm extremely pleased with the appointments we've made to the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance and the Corporate Risk & Broking businesses and to the Americas region. Not only have we enhanced the Operating Committee by increasing the strength of the brokerage perspective, but I'm very excited about bringing the vision and passion Carl Hess, Todd Jones and Joe Gunn bring to their new roles. I'm confident that based on their previous success and the depth of their knowledge of our business, they'll continue to be strong and effective leaders.
Now let's turn to our results for the quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.78 billion, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. This includes $51 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Commissions and fees for the reportable segments were up 2% on an organic basis.
The net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $32 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $209 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $275 million or 15.5% of revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $307 million or 17.6% of revenues. The year-over-year decline is due to revenue pressure from CRB and IRR and the seasonality of the Gras Savoye business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.35 billion or 22.5% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2015 of $1.27 billion or 22.8% of adjusted revenues.
For the quarter, loss per diluted share was $0.23, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04. Currency fluctuations, net of hedging, had a negative impact of $0.02 on adjusted EPS.
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. In the first year, we expected to achieve sales of approximately 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergies. We are where we want to be, but we also realize that achieving our first year goals is a small portion of our overall objective and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we've discussed on previous calls, the global health solutions and mid-market revenues will primarily be recognized in 2017. The majority of the P&C wins will also impact 2017 and beyond.
We're continuing to make good progress in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: global health care solutions, the mid-market health care exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector.
We've won another 6 global health care solution clients this quarter, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. We also won 30 single-country multinational assignments.
Turning to the mid-market exchange. As previously discussed, we sold approximately 70,000 eligible lives for the 2017 enrollment. We may see a pause in sales activity while the enrollment season is underway but continue to be pleased with our 2018 sales pipeline. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 16 new projects so far this year.
Now moving on to the tax and cost synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule, in fact. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term.
We originally estimated merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. We continue to estimate savings of approximately $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of at least $30 million.
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from OIP were approximately $14 million from the third quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $11 million of restructuring costs in the same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 for restructuring charges.
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%, Corporate Risk & Broking increased 8%, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance decreased 5% and Exchange Solutions increased 25%. All of the revenue results discussed in this segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.
Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 5%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees increased 2%. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to increased bulk lump sum project work in the U.S. and new pension administration client implementations, which were offset by softness in the Netherlands. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up as a result of strong demand for executive compensation work and the delivery of data surveys. But we continue to experience softness in the Rewards, Talent and Communication business in North America and EMEA.
Moving to health and benefits. We continue to see strong demand in the large company space globally, with strong product and planned management activity in North America. Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to new clients and higher call center demand.
We continue to have a positive outlook for HCB business for the rest of 2016. We should continue to see both lump sum projects in the fourth quarter. Talent and Rewards is seasonally stronger in the second half of the calendar year, and we continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses.
Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 8% from the prior year as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Revenue declines in North America and in the international business offset the growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. In North America, a onetime project in 2015 created a strong comparable, and our new business was lower than expected. China and Brazil accounted for most of the revenue declines in our international business as a result of the economic and political climate in those countries. Great Britain had very strong results across all lines of business, and Iberia led the growth for Western Europe, with some weakness in Denmark and with the affinity business.
We expect Great Britain and Western Europe to continue providing revenue growth, and we don't see any significant near-term changes in the Asian and Latin American markets. We're seeing a small pricing headwind in the North American market and continue to focus on building our new business pipeline. Overall, we expect similar results in the fourth quarter.
Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Commissions and fees were down by 5% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 5%, primarily due to a decline in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets business. The decline in North American reinsurance revenues offset the revenue growth in the other regions. The Capital Markets business, which is generally volatile and is dependent on transactions, generated its highest revenue ever in the third quarter of calendar year '15 and had nominal revenue this quarter. So while the business is rather small to our portfolio, the volatility had a material impact on the growth of the segment.
On a positive note, we continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Risk Consulting had modest revenue growth, led by software sales, and Investment had a very strong quarter as a result of increased performance fees and a soft comparable in the third quarter of '15. We anticipate that IRR will continue to see headwinds in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets businesses as we don't expect the overall environment to change by the end of the calendar year.
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first half with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $161 million, an increase of 25%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchanges revenue increased 35%, and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 14%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. Our Health and Welfare administration business continues to grow, primarily as a result of the new business we've won over the last 2 years.
We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from retirees, where 95% feel they selected the right plans to best meet their needs, and we have an overall 93% retiree satisfaction rate. We've also experienced 100% renewal as our first round of active exchange client contracts were ending this year.
We expect the fourth quarter revenue growth to be more moderate as the retiree and health and welfare businesses start to overlap the strong enrollment numbers and new clients, which were added in the fourth quarter of calendar year '15, which created a strong comparable.
I'm pleased with the progress on a number of initiatives associated with the merger, especially the focus on revenue synergies. We're even seeing crossover in marketing efforts we did not contemplate as we created Willis Towers Watson and remain committed to continue to support and encourage these activities. In order to provide the investments needed to attain our growth goals, we're taking steps to help ensure we achieve our merger commitments of enhanced margins and shareholder return. We're extremely focused on balancing our growth initiative while maintaining financial discipline. I feel we have the right team in place to deliver the 2017 objectives and beyond.
And last, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their enthusiasm in supporting our efforts and their continued steadfast commitments to our clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

I'd like to add my congratulations to Todd Jones, Carl Hess and Joe Gunn. I'm excited about how the experience Todd, Carl and Joe bring to the table aligns with our long-term opportunities and goals. And based on their proven track records, I'm confident in their future success.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.
Income from operations for the quarter was $1 million or 0.1% of revenues. The prior year third quarter pro forma operating income was $104 million or 5.9% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $243 million or 13.7% of revenues, and the prior year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $267 million or 15.3% of revenues. As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the third quarter margin.
Income from operations for the first 9 months of 2016 was $463 million or 7.8% of revenues. The prior year first 9 months pro forma operating income was $632 million or 11.3% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.25 billion or 20.7% of adjusted revenues, and the prior year first 9 months pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.13 billion or 20.3% of revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 46%, and the adjusted tax rate was 22%.
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.
For the third quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment, or HCB, was 16% as compared to pro forma 17% last year. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the company average.
For the first 9 months of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 22% as compared to pro forma 23% in 2015. We continue to anticipate the HCB segment operating margin will be in the low 20% range for the year.
For the third quarter, the Corporate Risk & Broking segment, or CRB, had an 11% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 14% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. Revenue pressure from North America and the international business impacted margin. The heavy weighting of Gras Savoye in the first quarter has also changed the seasonality of the quarterly margin. For the first 9 months, the operating margins for 2016 and pro forma for 2015 were 16%. We continue to anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The change in leadership has not impacted the focus to drive margin enhancement.
For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment, or IRR, had an 8% operating margin as compared to pro forma 10% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. The revenue pressure from Capital Markets and Reinsurance was generally offset by growth in Wholesale, Risk Consulting and Investment. For the first 9 months of 2016, the IRR segment operating margin was 26% as compared to pro forma 25% in 2015. Inclusive of the JLT legal settlement, we continue to expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.
Exchange Solutions' operating margin for the quarter and the prior year pro forma was 12%. For the first 9 months of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 18% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year. For the quarter, retiree and access exchanges led the segment with a 27% operating margin as we continue to invest in the active exchange.
For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year due to cost buildup for the enrollment season. Commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As of September 30, we had repurchased $233 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. We continue to anticipate a total repurchase of $300 million for 2016.
Free cash flow was $122 million this quarter and $457 million for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. We still expect to deliver approximately $650 million in free cash flow for 2016.
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for both integration and transaction-related items and restructuring items. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures. In fiscal '16, we're adjusting the expected reported revenue growth to be around 6% and constant currency revenue growth to be in the 9% to 10% range, with the primary growth drivers being the Gras Savoye acquisition and the Exchange Solutions segment. Last quarter, we estimated that organic revenue growth would be in the 2% to 3% range. Based on the third quarter results, we now expect organic revenue growth to be around 2%. 
We expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 7% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5%, and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
We're progressing with various cost-reduction programs, which will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. And we believe that we're beginning to realize the results of this cost control work. While costs can ebb and flow and it can be difficult to fully lock down sequential organic momentum, we believe we saw a modest net sequential enterprise expense reduction in Q2 and that we enhanced the level of sequential reduction in the third quarter versus the second. Assuming continued organic revenue growth, this is the path to margin expansion momentum in 2017.
On a segment basis, we're holding margin estimates to previously reported estimates for all segments. For revenue guidance, we'll be referring to organic commissions and fees. Based on the third quarter results, we're maintaining low single-digit revenue growth for HCB, lowering CRB revenue estimates from low single-digit growth to flat, lowering IRR revenue estimates from a low single-digit decline to a mid-single-digit decline and, finally, increasing Exchange Solutions' revenue growth from high 20s to around 30%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 5% to 7%, and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 23%. We expected GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is in line with our previous guidance. While our financial results this year haven't been as strong as we hoped, this adjusted EPS range represents upper-teens percentage growth over the merger pro forma for 2015. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro.
I continue to be pleased with the integration efforts. While we're seeing early signs of success in areas like reducing the tax rate, winning projects aligned to our revenue synergies and a greater focus on margin management, many of these initiatives are building the foundation for 2017 and beyond. I remain confident in achieving our long-term success.
Now I'll turn it back to John."

Thanks, Shlomo. I think as we came into this year, we could see there were some headwinds in some of the businesses that we were facing a little bit.

I think we've seen North America has been a place where we've probably seen it, particularly in CRB more than in some areas, although international has also been a place where we've experienced a good bit of a decline there. We see those things as being -- turning around somewhat next year. I think we had tough comparables on the international, for example, last year. We had some reversals of some income that we had booked in 2015 that occurred this year, that we have going on. I think we -- when we said what we were going to try to do this year, it was, first, we were going to try to make sure we got the right kind of margins, and then we were going to use that to a platform to build with profitable revenue growth. I think that's still been our focus. We feel pretty good about coming in at exactly what we had said last quarter with the EPS. We might be 1% or so lower on the -- or at the bottom end of the revenue guidance that we gave last quarter. But we still feel we'll come in right around there. I think with the new team we have in place, too, I think one of the things I like about that, with some strong brokerage representation for North America leading both CRB and the Americas geography, I think we're well poised to turn around North America there. So I do feel like we have the right people there, we have the right offerings, and I think we just need to build on that."

As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio. But in this particular quarter, best quarter ever in the third quarter of 2015. And nominal revenue is really -- I mean, it was pretty close to 0. So it was really quite nominal revenue for this year. And it reflects the fact that there's just been a dearth of deals in the insurance business generally. And so we're not expecting to see, for example, that to pick back up in the fourth quarter, although we do see some signs that 2017 -- I mean, we have had a couple of wins recently that could very well deliver some nice revenue in 2017. So we'll have to see about that. Reinsurance, we have a -- we are facing some headwinds in reinsurance. We -- our facultative reinsurance, of course, is off in CRB. So we don't report that with our -- in IRR. And that's the part of the business that's been growing more than the 3. But -- so we see that business is still facing some headwinds. I think some of restructurings that our clients have done and some of the just withdrawal of reinsurance from the market, as you've seen some big mergers, have also contributed to headwinds for us there. So again, we're not projecting that the fourth quarter is going to be a big improvement there either. I think some of the other businesses, Investment, which has been down for a number of quarters here, we saw some real improvement in the third quarter, and I think we feel better about the fourth quarter now than we would have a quarter or so ago. And I think we're beginning to see some signs in the Risk Consulting and Software of a bit of a pickup. So it's a mixed bag, but I think the -- I think we continue to see pressure on Reinsurance, and we continue to see Capital Markets as being down. And I think, overall, that's what contributes to a lower forecast for the fourth quarter for that segment."

Just a comment, Greg, on my words there. And they weren't intended to be profound words. It was actually more -- and I don't say mathematics in front of John. It was arithmetic.

It was actually more -- and I don't say mathematics in front of John. It was arithmetic. But what really we challenged ourselves to do this quarter was step back and say, ""Do we start to see the seeds of momentum shift towards our margin expansion goal?"" And while we're still in this period of, one, having comparison to big acquisition periods, so that makes it a little difficult on a comparison side. And so the comparisons aren't really apples and apples year-over-year. But we took a look sequentially at what we saw in the numbers, and given the actions we know we've taken this year, the path to margin expansion is continuing the kind of growth as we've had this year, albeit at a low level. And then sequentially costs are going down, the way margin enhancement pops is you get to a quarter where you're comparing to a year where you began the cost reductions and revenues have been growing through that period, and the margin enhancement pops. And so the only point I was trying to make is -- and again, with a lot of kind of noise in the system and you have to adjust for things that are seasonal in nature, but we believe that we see a sequential cost reduction momentum, which means that when we start comparing next year to 2016, that we would expect to see margin enhancement. So I didn't mean anything particular by citing organic growth, just saying that's the calculation."

But -- so certainly, we have incentive compensation programs across our businesses that are sensitized to performance. And you can see in our numbers that the segments, there's pretty broad diversity of performance in the segments. So there is a reduction at this point in incentive compensation, total dollars versus what the target amounts might be. And so those -- we have had some adjustments over the last couple of quarters. In terms of getting -- where we are right now and getting to the end of the year and having a material impact on margins, I don't think those adjustments are at that level. And I guess the other thing, just in terms of the way the accounting works that I'd observed is that the -- what we called in Towers Watson discretionary compensation, which was a quite material item financially relative to a total year, it's not as material for Willis Towers Watson because there are more separate sales compensation programs in Willis Towers Watson. So anyway, long and the short is just pure kind of bonus, not as impactful as Towers Watson was. But there have been some downward adjustments, and that's a part of -- that's supported margin somewhat."

If we look at North America, which is where we have experienced, I think, some of the biggest headwinds, we actually have exceeded our new business targets so far this year. So the new business part of it has gone relatively well. What has hurt us is, a, there has been a -- some of the existing clients are buying less reinsurance. And so we've seen that occur partly because people are buying less reinsurance, partly because mergers have actually just taken -- just cut the market in total. And then we've also seen -- we've had a couple of clients that have restructured things, some of the reinsurance programs, which have led to revenues being shifted to different years. And we've seen that on a couple of big ones that have had a material impact on our results. When we look at it overall, the Reinsurance is -- it does tend to be a little lumpy from year-to-year when we compare our results to -- I'd looked at -- we were looking at one of our big competitors the other day, and they were minus 4% last year and they're plus 1% this year. And so we were -- we had a better 2015 and a little bit lower 2016. I think we tend to look maybe at a little bit longer trends than just a year or so.

I think the background he has in investment will serve him well in understanding the capital markets part of the business also. Carl is one of the smartest people we have in the organization, and I think he'll be a quick study on the other parts of the business, too. So we like his background. We like the fact that he has been involved with delivering high revenue growth in the areas he's been in, and he understands the importance of generating profitable revenue growth.

And by moving Todd, who has a brokerage background, and then putting Joe Gunn in charge of North America, we have increased some of that perspective on the Operating Committee. And I think that will be very helpful. Both Todd and Joe, I think, are hardcharging folks who understand what we need to do to build up the brokerage business in North America, and I think that's going to be one of their key focuses in the short run.

There's a very disciplined process to track both the exits as well as then how that relates to the additional folks that are added in Mumbai or elsewhere in the service centers. So those costs are ""dropping"" to the bottom line. Of course, as a result of both the shortfall in revenues versus what we expected and the plans that had been built for the year relative to that business momentum, that has certainly challenged our ability to show kind of net margin expansion as a result of the savings that are going on, which is really why I wanted to highlight that sequential cost momentum item that I talked about in my script. So while, right now, you see in the adjusted operating margin a little bit of increase, it's not at all what you would expect based on the savings we're seeing in OIP plus merger. But we have been adjusting our expense levels all year as the year went by. And we're now starting to see the results of that. In this 2017 planning period, we continue to emphasize that. So we have our eye on the prize, and we think we're starting to see the kinds of results financially that will lead to margin expansion, but we're not seeing it yet."

It certainly has halted here this year.

Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.
Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.
I'd like to take a few minutes to address the management changes we announced last week. First, I'd like to thank Dominic Casserley for his contributions to Willis and all of his efforts in assisting in the creation of Willis Towers Watson. Dominic has been a terrific partner throughout the entire transaction and integration process. Second, I'm extremely pleased with the appointments we've made to the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance and the Corporate Risk & Broking businesses and to the Americas region. Not only have we enhanced the Operating Committee by increasing the strength of the brokerage perspective, but I'm very excited about bringing the vision and passion Carl Hess, Todd Jones and Joe Gunn bring to their new roles. I'm confident that based on their previous success and the depth of their knowledge of our business, they'll continue to be strong and effective leaders.
Now let's turn to our results for the quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.78 billion, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. This includes $51 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Commissions and fees for the reportable segments were up 2% on an organic basis.
The net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $32 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $209 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $275 million or 15.5% of revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $307 million or 17.6% of revenues. The year-over-year decline is due to revenue pressure from CRB and IRR and the seasonality of the Gras Savoye business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.35 billion or 22.5% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2015 of $1.27 billion or 22.8% of adjusted revenues.
For the quarter, loss per diluted share was $0.23, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04. Currency fluctuations, net of hedging, had a negative impact of $0.02 on adjusted EPS.
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. In the first year, we expected to achieve sales of approximately 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergies. We are where we want to be, but we also realize that achieving our first year goals is a small portion of our overall objective and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we've discussed on previous calls, the global health solutions and mid-market revenues will primarily be recognized in 2017. The majority of the P&C wins will also impact 2017 and beyond.
We're continuing to make good progress in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: global health care solutions, the mid-market health care exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector.
We've won another 6 global health care solution clients this quarter, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. We also won 30 single-country multinational assignments.
Turning to the mid-market exchange. As previously discussed, we sold approximately 70,000 eligible lives for the 2017 enrollment. We may see a pause in sales activity while the enrollment season is underway but continue to be pleased with our 2018 sales pipeline. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 16 new projects so far this year.
Now moving on to the tax and cost synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule, in fact. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term.
We originally estimated merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. We continue to estimate savings of approximately $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of at least $30 million.
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from OIP were approximately $14 million from the third quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $11 million of restructuring costs in the same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 for restructuring charges.
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%, Corporate Risk & Broking increased 8%, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance decreased 5% and Exchange Solutions increased 25%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.
Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 5%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees increased 2%. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to increased bulk lump sum project work in the U.S. and new pension administration client implementations, which were offset by softness in the Netherlands. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up as a result of strong demand for executive compensation work and the delivery of data surveys. But we continue to experience softness in the Rewards, Talent and Communication business in North America and EMEA.
Moving to health and benefits. We continue to see strong demand in the large company space globally, with strong product and planned management activity in North America. Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to new clients and higher call center demand.
We continue to have a positive outlook for HCB business for the rest of 2016. We should continue to see both lump sum projects in the fourth quarter. Talent and Rewards is seasonally stronger in the second half of the calendar year, and we continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses.
Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 8% from the prior year as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Revenue declines in North America and in the international business offset the growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. In North America, a onetime project in 2015 created a strong comparable, and our new business was lower than expected. China and Brazil accounted for most of the revenue declines in our international business as a result of the economic and political climate in those countries. Great Britain had very strong results across all lines of business, and Iberia led the growth for Western Europe, with some weakness in Denmark and with the affinity business.
We expect Great Britain and Western Europe to continue providing revenue growth, and we don't see any significant near-term changes in the Asian and Latin American markets. We're seeing a small pricing headwind in the North American market and continue to focus on building our new business pipeline. Overall, we expect similar results in the fourth quarter.
Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Commissions and fees were down by 5% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 5%, primarily due to a decline in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets business. The decline in North American reinsurance revenues offset the revenue growth in the other regions. The Capital Markets business, which is generally volatile and is dependent on transactions, generated its highest revenue ever in the third quarter of calendar year '15 and had nominal revenue this quarter. So while the business is rather small to our portfolio, the volatility had a material impact on the growth of the segment.
On a positive note, we continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Risk Consulting had modest revenue growth, led by software sales, and Investment had a very strong quarter as a result of increased performance fees and a soft comparable in the third quarter of '15. We anticipate that IRR will continue to see headwinds in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets businesses as we don't expect the overall environment to change by the end of the calendar year.
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first half with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $161 million, an increase of 25%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchanges revenue increased 35%, and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 14%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. Our Health and Welfare administration business continues to grow, primarily as a result of the new business we've won over the last 2 years.
We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from retirees, where 95% feel they selected the right plans to best meet their needs, and we have an overall 93% retiree satisfaction rate. We've also experienced 100% renewal as our first round of active exchange client contracts were ending this year.
We expect the fourth quarter revenue growth to be more moderate as the retiree and health and welfare businesses start to overlap the strong enrollment numbers and new clients, which were added in the fourth quarter of calendar year '15, which created a strong comparable.
I'm pleased with the progress on a number of initiatives associated with the merger, especially the focus on revenue synergies. We're even seeing crossover in marketing efforts we did not contemplate as we created Willis Towers Watson and remain committed to continue to support and encourage these activities. In order to provide the investments needed to attain our growth goals, we're taking steps to help ensure we achieve our merger commitments of enhanced margins and shareholder return. We're extremely focused on balancing our growth initiative while maintaining financial discipline. I feel we have the right team in place to deliver the 2017 objectives and beyond.
And last, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their enthusiasm in supporting our efforts and their continued steadfast commitments to our clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

And based on their proven track records, I'm confident in their future success.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.
Income from operations for the quarter was $1 million or 0.1% of revenues. The prior year third quarter pro forma operating income was $104 million or 5.9% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $243 million or 13.7% of revenues, and the prior year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $267 million or 15.3% of revenues. As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the third quarter margin.
Income from operations for the first 9 months of 2016 was $463 million or 7.8% of revenues. The prior year first 9 months pro forma operating income was $632 million or 11.3% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.25 billion or 20.7% of adjusted revenues, and the prior year first 9 months pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.13 billion or 20.3% of revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 46%, and the adjusted tax rate was 22%.
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.
For the third quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment, or HCB, was 16% as compared to pro forma 17% last year. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the company average.
For the first 9 months of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 22% as compared to pro forma 23% in 2015. We continue to anticipate the HCB segment operating margin will be in the low 20% range for the year.
For the third quarter, the Corporate Risk & Broking segment, or CRB, had an 11% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 14% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. Revenue pressure from North America and the international business impacted margin. The heavy weighting of Gras Savoye in the first quarter has also changed the seasonality of the quarterly margin. For the first 9 months, the operating margins for 2016 and pro forma for 2015 were 16%. We continue to anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The change in leadership has not impacted the focus to drive margin enhancement.
For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment, or IRR, had an 8% operating margin as compared to pro forma 10% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. The revenue pressure from Capital Markets and Reinsurance was generally offset by growth in Wholesale, Risk Consulting and Investment. For the first 9 months of 2016, the IRR segment operating margin was 26% as compared to pro forma 25% in 2015. Inclusive of the JLT legal settlement, we continue to expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.
Exchange Solutions operating margin for the quarter and the prior year pro forma was 12%. For the first 9 months of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 18% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year. For the quarter, retiree and access exchanges led the segment with a 27% operating margin as we continue to invest in the active exchange.
For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year due to cost buildup for the enrollment season. Commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As of September 30, we had repurchased $233 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. We continue to anticipate a total repurchase of $300 million for 2016.
Free cash flow was $122 million this quarter and $457 million for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. We still expect to deliver approximately $650 million in free cash flow for 2016.
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for both integration and transaction-related items and restructuring items. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures. In fiscal '16, we're adjusting the expected reported revenue growth to be around 6% and constant currency revenue growth to be in the 9% to 10% range, with the primary growth drivers being the Gras Savoye acquisition and the Exchange Solutions segment. Last quarter, we estimated that organic revenue growth would be in the 2% to 3% range. Based on the third quarter results, we now expect organic revenue growth to be around 2%. 
We expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 7% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5%, and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
We're progressing with various cost-reduction programs, which will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. And we believe that we're beginning to realize the results of this cost control work. While costs can ebb and flow and it can be difficult to fully lock down sequential organic momentum, we believe we saw a modest net sequential enterprise expense reduction in Q2 and that we enhanced the level of sequential reduction in the third quarter versus the second. Assuming continued organic revenue growth, this is the path to margin expansion momentum in 2017.
On a segment basis, we're holding margin estimates to previously reported estimates for all segments. For revenue guidance, we'll be referring to organic commissions and fees. Based on the third quarter results, we're maintaining low single-digit revenue growth for HCB, lowering CRB revenue estimates from low single-digit growth to flat, lowering IRR revenue estimates from a low single-digit decline to a mid-single-digit decline and, finally, increasing Exchange Solutions revenue growth from high 20s to around 30%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 5% to 7%, and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 23%. We expected GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is in line with our previous guidance. While our financial results this year haven't been as strong as we hoped, this adjusted EPS range represents upper-teens percentage growth over the merger pro forma for 2015. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro.
I continue to be pleased with the integration efforts. While we're seeing early signs of success in areas like reducing the tax rate, winning projects aligned to our revenue synergies and a greater focus on margin management, many of these initiatives are building the foundation for 2017 and beyond. I remain confident in achieving our long-term success.
Now I'll turn it back to John."

Thanks, Shlomo. I think as we came into this year, we could see there were some headwinds in some of the businesses that we were facing a little bit.

I think we've seen North America has been a place where we've probably seen it, particularly in CRB more than in some areas, although international has also been a place where we've experienced a good bit of a decline there. We see those things as being -- turning around somewhat next year. I think we had tough comparables on the international; for example, last year, we had some reversals of some income that we had booked in 2015 that occurred this year, that we have going on. I think we -- when we said what we were going to try to do this year, it was, first, we were going to try to make sure we got the right kind of margins, and then we were going to use that to a platform to build with profitable revenue growth. I think that's still been our focus. We feel pretty good about coming in at exactly what we had said last quarter with the EPS. We might be 1% or so lower on the -- or at the bottom end of the revenue guidance that we gave last quarter. But we still feel we'll come in right around there. 
I think with the new team we have in place, too, I think one of the things I like about that, with some strong brokerage representation for North America leading both CRB and the Americas geography, I think we're well poised to turn around North America there. So I do feel like we have the right people there, we have the right offerings, and I think we just need to build on that."

I think IRR is a -- it's a mixture of a number of businesses. As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio.

As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio. But in this particular quarter, best quarter ever in the third quarter of 2015. And nominal revenue is really -- I mean, it was pretty close to 0. So it was really quite nominal revenue for this year. And it reflects the fact that there's just been a dearth of deals in the insurance business generally. And so we're not expecting to see, for example, that to pick back up in the fourth quarter, although we do see some signs that 2017 -- I mean, we have had a couple of wins recently that could very well deliver some nice revenue in 2017. So we'll have to see about that. 
Reinsurance. We have a -- we are facing some headwinds in reinsurance. We -- our facultative reinsurance, of course, is off in CRB. So we don't report that with our -- in IRR. And that's the part of the business that's been growing more than the 3. But -- so we see that business is still facing some headwinds. I think some of restructurings that our clients have done and some of the just withdrawal of reinsurance from the market, as you've seen some big mergers, have also contributed to headwinds for us there. So again, we're not projecting that the fourth quarter is going to be a big improvement there either. I think some of the other businesses, Investment, which has been down for a number of quarters here, we saw some real improvement in the third quarter, and I think we feel better about the fourth quarter now than we would have a quarter or so ago. And I think we're beginning to see some signs in the Risk Consulting and Software of a bit of a pickup.

It was actually more -- and I don't say mathematics in front of John. It was arithmetic. But what really we challenged ourselves to do this quarter was step back and say, ""Do we start to see the seeds of momentum shift towards our margin expansion goal?"" And while we're still in this period of, one, having comparison to big acquisition periods, so that makes it a little difficult on a comparison side. And so the comparisons aren't really apples and apples year-over-year. But we took a look sequentially at what we saw in the numbers. And given the actions we know we've taken this year, the path to margin expansion is continuing the kind of growth as we've had this year, albeit at a low level. And then if sequentially costs are going down, the way margin enhancement pops is you get to a quarter where you're comparing to a year where you began the cost reductions and revenues have been growing through that period, and the margin enhancement pops. And so the only point I was trying to make is -- and again, with a lot of kind of noise in the system and you have to adjust for things that are seasonal in nature, but we believe that we see a sequential cost reduction momentum, which means that when we start comparing next year to 2016, that we would expect to see margin enhancement. So I didn't mean anything particular by citing organic growth, just saying that's the calculation."

But -- so certainly, we have incentive compensation programs across our businesses that are sensitized to performance. And you can see in our numbers that the segments -- there's pretty broad diversity of performance in the segments. So there is a reduction at this point in incentive compensation, total dollars versus what the target amounts might be. And so those -- we have had some adjustments over the last couple of quarters. 
In terms of getting -- where we are right now and getting to the end of the year and having a material impact on margins, I don't think those adjustments are at that level. And I guess the other thing, just in terms of the way the accounting works that I'd observed is that the -- what we called in Towers Watson discretionary compensation, which was a quite material item financially relative to a total year, it's not as material for Willis Towers Watson because there are more separate sales compensation programs in Willis Towers Watson. 
So anyway, long and the short is just pure kind of bonus, not as impactful as Towers Watson was. But there have been some downward adjustments, and that's a part of -- that's supported margin somewhat."

If we look at North America, which is where we have experienced, I think, some of the biggest headwinds, we actually have exceeded our new business targets so far this year. So the new business part of it has gone relatively well. What has hurt us is, a, there has been a -- some of the existing clients are buying less reinsurance. And so we've seen that occur partly because people are buying less reinsurance, partly because mergers have actually just taken -- just cut the market in total. And then we've also seen -- we've had a couple of clients that have restructured things, some of the reinsurance programs, which have led to revenues being shifted to different years. And we've seen that on a couple of big ones that have had a material impact on our results. 
When we look at it overall, the Reinsurance is -- it does tend to be a little lumpy from year-to-year when we compare our results to -- I'd look at -- we were looking at one of our big competitors the other day, and they were minus 4% last year and they're plus 1% this year. And so we were -- we had a better 2015 and a little bit lower 2016. I think we tend to look maybe at a little bit longer trends than just a year or so.

I think I'll let -- Roger will probably have some things to add to that. But I think, Mark, if you remember that slide we had from Analyst Day, one of the points of that was to show that there were a number of different levers that if you grew at 2.5%, then you're at a 25% tax rate, and you reduce to 8 million shares, you could get to $10.10. If you grew at 4.5% and you had a 25% for tax rate and you only reduced by 2 million or 4 million shares, you could still get to $10.10. 
So what we were trying to illustrate is we did have a number of levers to pull. We tended to focus in that one on that even at a relatively low growth rate, we could still get to $10.10 if we were buying back enough shares. But in addition to that, we could -- we didn't factor in what happens if our tax rate is better than we had suggested, for example. So there -- we have a couple of different levers that we could pull.

Well, so first of all, when Dominic indicated his intention to leave at the end of the year, we had to find a replacement for running IRR. And I think one of the things that we especially like about Carl, he had run the investment line of business for both Watson Wyatt and Towers Watson as part -- when he was running that, he was part of a leadership team in that segment. And at the time, it included both Risk Consulting and Software and our -- the Reinsurance business that we had at Towers Watson. So Carl has some background in all 3 of those areas. I think the background he has in investment will serve him well in understanding the capital markets part of the business also. Carl is one of the smartest people we have in the organization, and I think he'll be a quick study on the other parts of the business, too. So we liked his background. We like the fact that he has been involved with delivering high revenue growth in the areas he's been in, and he understands the importance of generating profitable revenue growth. So he was, I think, a very good fit for that. 
In terms of CRB and North America, as I mentioned in the script, one of the things that I thought we needed more of a perspective on at the Operating Committee was the -- our brokers. And by moving Todd, who has a brokerage background, and then putting Joe Gunn in charge of North America, we have increased some of that perspective on the Operating Committee. And I think that will be very helpful. Both Todd and Joe, I think, are hard-charging folks who understand what we need to do to build up the brokerage business in North America, and I think that's going to be one of their key focuses in the short run. And as I said earlier, I do think that this is a business that we probably have overcomplicated our structure a little bit, and I do think some streamlining is probably called for."

So those costs are ""dropping"" to the bottom line. Of course, as a result of both the shortfall in revenues versus what we expected and the plans that had been built for the year relative to that business momentum, that has certainly challenged our ability to show kind of net margin expansion as a result of the savings that are going on, which is really why I wanted to highlight that sequential cost momentum item that I talked about in my script. 
So while right now you see in the adjusted operating margin a little bit of increase, it's not at all what you would expect based on the savings we're seeing in OIP plus merger. But we have been adjusting our expense levels all year as the year went by. And we're now starting to see the results of that. In this 2017 planning period, we continue to emphasize that.

It certainly has halted here this year.

When we watched the Analyst Day on 9/30, I sort of assumed that Tim Wright and Dominic Casserley were the authors of the plan that was articulated for the traditional insurance brokers type segment.

Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.
Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We've provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.
I'd like to take a few minutes to address the management changes we announced last week. First, I'd like to thank Dominic Casserley for his contributions to Willis and all of his efforts in assisting in the creation of Willis Towers Watson. Dominic has been a terrific partner throughout the entire transaction and integration process. Second, I'm extremely pleased with the appointments we've made to the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance and the Corporate Risk & Broking businesses and to the Americas region. Not only have we enhanced the Operating Committee by increasing the strength of the brokerage perspective, but I'm very excited about bringing the vision and passion Carl Hess, Todd Jones and Joe Gunn bring to their new roles. I'm confident that based on their previous success and the depth of their knowledge of our business, they'll continue to be strong and effective leaders.
Now let's turn to our results for the quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.78 billion, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. This includes $51 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Commissions and fees for the reportable segments were up 2% on an organic basis.
The net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $32 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $209 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $275 million or 15.5% of revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $307 million or 17.6% of revenues. The year-over-year decline is due to revenue pressure from CRB and IRR and the seasonality of the Gras Savoye business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.35 billion or 22.5% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2015 of $1.27 billion or 22.8% of adjusted revenues.
For the quarter, loss per diluted share was $0.23, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04. Currency fluctuations, net of hedging, had a negative impact of $0.02 on adjusted EPS.
Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. In the first year, we expected to achieve sales of approximately 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergies. We are where we want to be, but we also realize that achieving our first year goals is a small portion of our overall objective and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we've discussed on previous calls, the global health solutions and mid-market revenues will primarily be recognized in 2017. The majority of the P&C wins will also impact 2017 and beyond.
We're continuing to make good progress in the 3 areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: global health care solutions, the mid-market health care exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector.
We've won another 6 global health care solution clients this quarter, and the pipeline continues to look very strong. We also won 30 single-country multinational assignments.
Turning to the mid-market exchange. As previously discussed, we sold approximately 70,000 eligible lives for the 2017 enrollment. We may see a pause in sales activity while the enrollment season is underway but continue to be pleased with our 2018 sales pipeline. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 16 new projects so far this year.
Now moving on to the tax and cost synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule, in fact. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term.
We originally estimated merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. We continue to estimate savings of approximately $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of at least $30 million.
Next, I'd like to move to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. Incremental savings from OIP were approximately $14 million from the third quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $11 million of restructuring costs in the same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 for restructuring charges.
Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%, Corporate Risk & Broking increased 8%, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance decreased 5% and Exchange Solutions increased 25%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.
Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 5%, driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees increased 2%. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to increased bulk lump sum project work in the U.S. and new pension administration client implementations, which were offset by softness in the Netherlands. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up as a result of strong demand for executive compensation work and the delivery of data surveys. But we continue to experience softness in the Rewards, Talent and Communication business in North America and EMEA.
Moving to health and benefits. We continue to see strong demand in the large company space globally, with strong product and planned management activity in North America. Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, continued to produce solid results due to new clients and higher call center demand.
We continue to have a positive outlook for HCB business for the rest of 2016. We should continue to see both lump sum projects in the fourth quarter. Talent and Rewards is seasonally stronger in the second half of the calendar year, and we continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses.
Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB. Commissions and fees grew 8% from the prior year as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Revenue declines in North America and in the international business offset the growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. In North America, a onetime project in 2015 created a strong comparable, and our new business was lower than expected. China and Brazil accounted for most of the revenue declines in our international business as a result of the economic and political climate in those countries. Great Britain had very strong results across all lines of business, and Iberia led the growth for Western Europe, with some weakness in Denmark and with the affinity business.
We expect Great Britain and Western Europe to continue providing revenue growth, and we don't see any significant near-term changes in the Asian and Latin American markets. We're seeing a small pricing headwind in the North American market and continue to focus on building our new business pipeline. Overall, we expect similar results in the fourth quarter.
Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Commissions and fees were down by 5% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 5%, primarily due to a decline in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets business. The decline in North American reinsurance revenues offset the revenue growth in the other regions. The Capital Markets business, which is generally volatile and is dependent on transactions, generated its highest revenue ever in the third quarter of calendar year '15 and had nominal revenue this quarter. So while the business is rather small to our portfolio, the volatility had a material impact on the growth of the segment.
On a positive note, we continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Risk Consulting had modest revenue growth, led by software sales, and Investment had a very strong quarter as a result of increased performance fees and a soft comparable in the third quarter of '15. We anticipate that IRR will continue to see headwinds in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets businesses as we don't expect the overall environment to change by the end of the calendar year.
Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first half with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $161 million, an increase of 25%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchanges revenue increased 35%, and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 14%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. Our Health and Welfare administration business continues to grow, primarily as a result of the new business we've won over the last 2 years.
We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from retirees, where 95% feel they selected the right plans to best meet their needs, and we have an overall 93% retiree satisfaction rate. We've also experienced 100% renewal as our first round of active exchange client contracts were ending this year.
We expect the fourth quarter revenue growth to be more moderate as the retiree and health and welfare businesses start to overlap the strong enrollment numbers and new clients, which were added in the fourth quarter of calendar year '15, which created a strong comparable.
I'm pleased with the progress on a number of initiatives associated with the merger, especially the focus on revenue synergies. We're even seeing crossover in marketing efforts we did not contemplate as we created Willis Towers Watson and remain committed to continue to support and encourage these activities. In order to provide the investments needed to attain our growth goals, we're taking steps to help ensure we achieve our merger commitments of enhanced margins and shareholder return. We're extremely focused on balancing our growth initiative while maintaining financial discipline. I feel we have the right team in place to deliver the 2017 objectives and beyond.
And last, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their enthusiasm in supporting our efforts and their continued steadfast commitments to our clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger."

And based on their proven track records, I'm confident in their future success.
Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.
Income from operations for the quarter was $1 million or 0.1% of revenues. The prior year third quarter pro forma operating income was $104 million or 5.9% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $243 million or 13.7% of revenues, and the prior year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $267 million or 15.3% of revenues. As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the third quarter margin.
Income from operations for the first 9 months of 2016 was $463 million or 7.8% of revenues. The prior year first 9 months pro forma operating income was $632 million or 11.3% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.25 billion or 20.7% of adjusted revenues, and the prior year first 9 months pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.13 billion or 20.3% of revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 46%, and the adjusted tax rate was 22%.
Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.
For the third quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment, or HCB, was 16% as compared to pro forma 17% last year. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the company average.
For the first 9 months of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 22% as compared to pro forma 23% in 2015. We continue to anticipate the HCB segment operating margin will be in the low 20% range for the year.
For the third quarter, the Corporate Risk & Broking segment, or CRB, had an 11% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 14% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. Revenue pressure from North America and the international business impacted margin. The heavy weighting of Gras Savoye in the first quarter has also changed the seasonality of the quarterly margin. For the first 9 months, the operating margins for 2016 and pro forma for 2015 were 16%. We continue to anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The change in leadership has not impacted the focus to drive margin enhancement.
For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment, or IRR, had an 8% operating margin as compared to pro forma 10% operating margin in the prior year third quarter. The revenue pressure from Capital Markets and Reinsurance was generally offset by growth in Wholesale, Risk Consulting and Investment. For the first 9 months of 2016, the IRR segment operating margin was 26% as compared to pro forma 25% in 2015. Inclusive of the JLT legal settlement, we continue to expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.
Exchange Solutions operating margin for the quarter and the prior year pro forma was 12%. For the first 9 months of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 18% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year. For the quarter, retiree and access exchanges led the segment with a 27% operating margin as we continue to invest in the active exchange.
For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year due to cost buildup for the enrollment season. Commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.
Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. As of September 30, we had repurchased $233 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. We continue to anticipate a total repurchase of $300 million for 2016.
Free cash flow was $122 million this quarter and $457 million for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. We still expect to deliver approximately $650 million in free cash flow for 2016.
Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for both integration and transaction-related items and restructuring items. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures. In fiscal '16, we're adjusting the expected reported revenue growth to be around 6% and constant currency revenue growth to be in the 9% to 10% range, with the primary growth drivers being the Gras Savoye acquisition and the Exchange Solutions segment. Last quarter, we estimated that organic revenue growth would be in the 2% to 3% range. Based on the third quarter results, we now expect organic revenue growth to be around 2%. 
We expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 7% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5%, and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%.
We're progressing with various cost-reduction programs, which will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. And we believe that we're beginning to realize the results of this cost control work. While costs can ebb and flow and it can be difficult to fully lock down sequential organic momentum, we believe we saw a modest net sequential enterprise expense reduction in Q2 and that we enhanced the level of sequential reduction in the third quarter versus the second. Assuming continued organic revenue growth, this is the path to margin expansion momentum in 2017.
On a segment basis, we're holding margin estimates to previously reported estimates for all segments. For revenue guidance, we'll be referring to organic commissions and fees. Based on the third quarter results, we're maintaining low single-digit revenue growth for HCB, lowering CRB revenue estimates from low single-digit growth to flat, lowering IRR revenue estimates from a low single-digit decline to a mid-single-digit decline and, finally, increasing Exchange Solutions revenue growth from high 20s to around 30%.
The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 5% to 7%, and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 23%. We expected GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is in line with our previous guidance. While our financial results this year haven't been as strong as we hoped, this adjusted EPS range represents upper-teens percentage growth over the merger pro forma for 2015. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro.
I continue to be pleased with the integration efforts. While we're seeing early signs of success in areas like reducing the tax rate, winning projects aligned to our revenue synergies and a greater focus on margin management, many of these initiatives are building the foundation for 2017 and beyond. I remain confident in achieving our long-term success.

I think as we came into this year, we could see there were some headwinds in some of the businesses that we were facing a little bit. I think we've seen North America has been a place where we've probably seen it, particularly in CRB more than in some areas, although international has also been a place where we've experienced a good bit of a decline there. We see those things as being -- turning around somewhat next year. I think we had tough comparables on the international; for example, last year, we had some reversals of some income that we had booked in 2015 that occurred this year, that we have going on. I think we -- when we said what we were going to try to do this year, it was, first, we were going to try to make sure we got the right kind of margins, and then we were going to use that to a platform to build with profitable revenue growth. I think that's still been our focus. We feel pretty good about coming in at exactly what we had said last quarter with the EPS. We might be 1% or so lower on the -- or at the bottom end of the revenue guidance that we gave last quarter. But we still feel we'll come in right around there. I think with the new team we have in place, too, I think one of the things I like about that, with some strong brokerage representation for North America leading both CRB and the Americas geography, I think we're well poised to turn around North America there. So I do feel like we have the right people there, we have the right offerings, and I think we just need to build on that."

As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio. But in this particular quarter, best quarter ever in the third quarter of 2015. And nominal revenue is really -- I mean, it was pretty close to 0. So it was really quite nominal revenue for this year. And it reflects the fact that there's just been a dearth of deals in the insurance business generally. And so we're not expecting to see, for example, that to pick back up in the fourth quarter, although we do see some signs that 2017 -- I mean, we have had a couple of wins recently that could very well deliver some nice revenue in 2017. So we'll have to see about that. Reinsurance. We have a -- we are facing some headwinds in reinsurance. We -- our facultative reinsurance, of course, is off in CRB. So we don't report that with our -- in IRR. And that's the part of the business that's been growing more than the 3. But -- so we see that business is still facing some headwinds. I think some of restructurings that our clients have done and some of the just withdrawal of reinsurance from the market, as you've seen some big mergers, have also contributed to headwinds for us there. So again, we're not projecting that the fourth quarter is going to be a big improvement there either. I think some of the other businesses, Investment, which has been down for a number of quarters here, we saw some real improvement in the third quarter, and I think we feel better about the fourth quarter now than we would have a quarter or so ago. And I think we're beginning to see some signs in the Risk Consulting and Software of a bit of a pickup. So it's a mixed bag, but I think the -- I think we continue to see pressure on Reinsurance, and we continue to see Capital Markets as being down. And I think, overall, that's what contributes to a lower forecast for the fourth quarter for that segment."

It was actually more -- and I don't say mathematics in front of John. It was arithmetic. But what really we challenged ourselves to do this quarter was step back and say, ""Do we start to see the seeds of momentum shift towards our margin expansion goal?"" And while we're still in this period of, one, having comparison to big acquisition periods, so that makes it a little difficult on a comparison side. And so the comparisons aren't really apples and apples year-over-year. But we took a look sequentially at what we saw in the numbers. And given the actions we know we've taken this year, the path to margin expansion is continuing the kind of growth as we've had this year, albeit at a low level. And then if sequentially costs are going down, the way margin enhancement pops is you get to a quarter where you're comparing to a year where you began the cost reductions and revenues have been growing through that period, and the margin enhancement pops. And so the only point I was trying to make is -- and again, with a lot of kind of noise in the system and you have to adjust for things that are seasonal in nature, but we believe that we see a sequential cost reduction momentum, which means that when we start comparing next year to 2016, that we would expect to see margin enhancement. So I didn't mean anything particular by citing organic growth, just saying that's the calculation."

So there is a reduction at this point in incentive compensation, total dollars versus what the target amounts might be. And so those -- we have had some adjustments over the last couple of quarters. In terms of getting -- where we are right now and getting to the end of the year and having a material impact on margins, I don't think those adjustments are at that level. And I guess the other thing, just in terms of the way the accounting works that I'd observed is that the -- what we called in Towers Watson discretionary compensation, which was a quite material item financially relative to a total year, it's not as material for Willis Towers Watson because there are more separate sales compensation programs in Willis Towers Watson. So anyway, long and the short is just pure kind of bonus, not as impactful as Towers Watson was.

So the new business part of it has gone relatively well. What has hurt us is, a, there has been a -- some of the existing clients are buying less reinsurance. And so we've seen that occur partly because people are buying less reinsurance, partly because mergers have actually just taken -- just cut the market in total. And then we've also seen -- we've had a couple of clients that have restructured things, some of the reinsurance programs, which have led to revenues being shifted to different years. And we've seen that on a couple of big ones that have had a material impact on our results. When we look at it overall, the Reinsurance is -- it does tend to be a little lumpy from year-to-year when we compare our results to -- I'd look at -- we were looking at one of our big competitors the other day, and they were minus 4% last year and they're plus 1% this year. And so we were -- we had a better 2015 and a little bit lower 2016. I think we tend to look maybe at a little bit longer trends than just a year or so.

And I made the changes to put that team in place. And so it wasn't anything specific about just 1 quarter or just -- it was a matter of identifying the teams that I felt the most confidence in."

If you grew at 4.5% and you had a 25% for tax rate and you only reduced by 2 million or 4 million shares, you could still get to $10.10.

Well, so first of all, when Dominic indicated his intention to leave at the end of the year, we had to find a replacement for running IRR. And I think one of the things that we especially like about Carl, he had run the investment line of business for both Watson Wyatt and Towers Watson as part -- when he was running that, he was part of a leadership team in that segment. And at the time, it included both Risk Consulting and Software and our -- the Reinsurance business that we had at Towers Watson. So Carl has some background in all 3 of those areas. I think the background he has in investment will serve him well in understanding the capital markets part of the business also. Carl is one of the smartest people we have in the organization, and I think he'll be a quick study on the other parts of the business, too. So we liked his background. We like the fact that he has been involved with delivering high revenue growth in the areas he's been in, and he understands the importance of generating profitable revenue growth. So he was, I think, a very good fit for that. In terms of CRB and North America, as I mentioned in the script, one of the things that I thought we needed more of a perspective on at the Operating Committee was the -- our brokers. And by moving Todd, who has a brokerage background, and then putting Joe Gunn in charge of North America, we have increased some of that perspective on the Operating Committee. And I think that will be very helpful. Both Todd and Joe, I think, are hard-charging folks who understand what we need to do to build up the brokerage business in North America, and I think that's going to be one of their key focuses in the short run. And as I said earlier, I do think that this is a business that we probably have overcomplicated our structure a little bit, and I do think some streamlining is probably called for."

Of course, as a result of both the shortfall in revenues versus what we expected and the plans that had been built for the year relative to that business momentum, that has certainly challenged our ability to show kind of net margin expansion as a result of the savings that are going on, which is really why I wanted to highlight that sequential cost momentum item that I talked about in my script. So while right now you see in the adjusted operating margin a little bit of increase, it's not at all what you would expect based on the savings we're seeing in OIP plus merger. But we have been adjusting our expense levels all year as the year went by. And we're now starting to see the results of that. In this 2017 planning period, we continue to emphasize that.
