I am pleased with our results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and I commend our Associates for the tremendous value they provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel.

I am pleased with our results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and I commend our Associates for the tremendous value they provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel. Day in and day out, they are focused on creating value for all of our stakeholders, and ultimately, for the patients we all serve. We play a vital role in the provision of health care which is grounded in our dedication to operational excellence, our continued improvement in efficiency and our bold and great innovation. Everything we do is ultimately driven by [indiscernible] enabling high-quality pharmaceutical care for patient. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed and our partnership philosophy and increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing creative solutions to the challenges inherent in today's healthcare market base. The  proficiency with which run our business creates value for all of our stakeholders and enables us to strategically position ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are unfolding in a rapidly changing landscape. 
Tim will provide the details on our financial performance in the quarter, but I want to highlight a few items. Revenues were up 9% in the December quarter to $36.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.27, an impressive result considering the strong performance in the prior year. We are making good progress on our free cash flow objectives for the year, generating $661 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. In addition, we have continued to manage strategic investments in our business in order to position ourselves well to meet the changing needs of our customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities. In November, we closed acquisition of PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compound and sterile operations to acute-care hospitals in the U.S. Health systems are playing increasingly important role for our patient care. And this acquisition represents a significant investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to the key customer segments. PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high quality CSPs in select therapeutic areas, combined with the impressive track record of growth makes them a compelling addition to ABDC. We are very pleased that PharMEDium's new state of the art facility based in New Jersey is now open and providing high-quality sterile IV products to the customers. This new facility firmly enhances their capabilities and capacity, and will be critical to supporting the future growth we expect in this business. The integration work with ABDC is going very well, and PharMEDium is on track to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and to our health systems customers for many years to come. As we have previously discussed, in addition to making investments in our business, we have also carved out our commitment to our shareholders and have virtually completely offset the expected impact of exercises of the warrants held by Walgreens Boots Alliance we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017. While the only share repurchases in the December quarter were under the special program and related to hedging, we did repurchase $100 million under our normal share repurchases program in January. I'm very proud of the financial stewardship we have demonstrated over the years and we remain disciplined in the deployment of capital. We are fortunate to be part of a unique and very successful industry that is excelled by constantly working to take costs out of the health care system by helping to ensure that patients have the widest possible access to the many patients the physicians prescribe for them. The industry is competitive and stable in large part because we enjoy a solid level of organic market growth, but also because participants in this industry are sophisticated enterprises that have made important investments in infrastructure and technology in order to continuously improve the most efficient and secure pharmaceutical supply chain in the world. Today, our expertise extends well beyond the [indiscernible] logistics. We help enable pharmaceutical care, serving manufacturers as they strive to develop new products and get to the market and healthcare providers as they focus on expertly improving patient outcomes while managing the costs of care. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned within this industry to help support the entire life cycle of growth and to ensure patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapies across all sites of care. We work with thousands of manufacturers and make daily deliveries to tens of thousands of customers, efficiently turning our inventory to maintain an order full rate of 99%. We work effectively in a highly regulated environment, maintain the flexibility to respond to emergencies on demand and we do start an exceptionally low cost. In many cases, patients' lives are at stake, and our Associates never hesitate to creatively solve problems and meet whatever challenges might be in front of them. 
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. AmerisourceBergen drive at a solid quarter, with revenues up 5%, driven in large part by solid organic volume growth, offset in part by some previously announced lost business. Our retail chain, mail order and hospital customers all had strong revenue growth in the quarter. ABDC is working with some tough compressions this year, and generic inflation in particular, is declining more than we had originally anticipated. As always, we continue to remain focused on driving efficiency in operations without sacrificing the service we are able to provide our customers. We also are committed to make inventions in our business and will position us well to take advantage of future opportunities. These activities are critical to securing future growth. Just this week, we began servicing over 900 public schools with a brand specialty products and some of the generics [indiscernible] in the food and drug combinations stores. This is a great example of how we continue to support exit to specialty products across all sites of care. One of the unique aspects of this distribution agreement is that Publix will utilize our RFIV enabled [indiscernible] especially drug inventory cabinet as they further develop their specialty pharmacy offerings. In addition, in January, we saw an early renewal and a nine-year contact with our largest independent pharmacy group purchasing organization customer called Compliance Pharmacy Alliance or CPA. CPA is one of the most innovative groups of independent pharmacy owners and has become an important anchor customer in our independent retail segment with 1,225 member stores. Since we first began our relationship back in 2009, they have nearly doubled the number of member stores. The impressive growth, the high-quality leadership they provide in independent pharmacy and the value they place in one of our Good Neighbor Pharmacy programs, made them an exceptional long-term partner. Both the CPA contract and the public contracts further strengthened our high-quality retail customer base and provide opportunity for future growth. We also are pleased with the performance in our health systems customers this quarter. Our acute-care customers increasingly provides some of the most important touch points for patient care. These customers now represent one of the fastest-growing segments we serve in ABDC and investments we have made in targeted programs and services for this channel is paying off. For example, both our progenerics programs and our private-label generic program [indiscernible] serve hospitals as well as retailers, and of course, as I mentioned, earlier, we closed the PharMEDium acquisition during the quarter, and we have made excellent progress on the integration of this business. I am very excited by what our health systems customers bring to ABC, and we continue to explore ways to bring innovative new solutions to help address the challenges they face in a rapidly changing market. 
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving revenues up 13%. Our community oncology business in particular had a strong quarter, and our physician distribution businesses also had a good quarter. Our market leadership in specialties rooted to lives of our customers and long and deep experience in the marketplace. The expertise we have in this area and the portfolio of services we have developed over many years extends well beyond specialty logistics. We hope manufacturers and healthcare providers manage the distinct requirements with specific disease states and unique [indiscernible] of products. Our collaborative approach in this area has been the foundation upon which we have established ourselves as the preferred partner for specialty products and services, and gives us the firm footing in this most vibrant and dynamic area of the marketplace. In the market, we have increasingly focused on the cost of care, the best way to discover and deliver value in the long run is to work in concert with our business partners. One of the ways we accomplish this is through our globe supply and manufacture relations business based in Bern, Switzerland, also, known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. We have made important progress in the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of sophistication and coordination between manufacturers and our customers. In October, the Switzerland teams launched a new portal that provides business insights and customize reporting for our generics manufacturer partners. [indiscernible] offers realtime access to AmerisourceBergen sales data as well as inventory management and sales forecasting tools. The Swiss-based also offers a flexibility to schedule and receive customized reports based on the manufacturers' business needs. It is value is evidenced by its rapid adoption and its usage by virtually all of our generic manufacturer partners accessing the system. Looking ahead, we continue to review the possibility to expand the breakthrough report and data for manufacturers, helping them make more informed decisions and supporting their efforts to improve supply chain efficiency on their products. 
Let's turn now to the Other segment. This segment continues to benefit from the inclusion of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and [indiscernible] to help them continue to meet their long-term objectives. The companion animal business was especially strong in the December quarter, as MWI benefited from strong organic growth, new product introductions and healthy pricing environment. We are very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016, and will make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to pharmaceutical supply channel as we continue to grow our presence in the complex animal health segment. Just this week, our MWI national sales conference in Orlando, and I was reminded again of the strong culture of MWI. The excellent fit with ABC and the significant industry presence that MWI has in animal health, which is exemplified by the demand generating sales force. 
Our manufacture services business also had a solid December quarter, with large group in particular performing very well as they grow their business with key manufacturer customers. Our expertise in developing patient access in this program and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory [indiscernible] and quality areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Our increasingly global reach in this area further expands our value proposition to manufacturers. We continuously seek out ways to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products whether through world career in the clinical cloud base or through our consulting business in the commercialization phases. When we combine these unique capabilities with other programs and services ABC offers, we are increasingly able to effectively support products launched in most of the developed world. As I said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. We are well-positioned in all of our customer segments, and we are proud to service flagship customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance with the pharmaceuticals they need to meet the needs of their patients on a daily basis. 
While we face headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, we are well-positioned to deliver 50% to 80% adjusted earnings per share growth in the years following 2 consecutive years on which we deliver growth over 2015. Tim will provide the details on our revised guidance, and while I'm disappointed that we no longer believe we can achieve the high end of our original EPS guidance range for fiscal 2016, we remain on track to deliver strong revenue growth and substantial free cash flow over the course of the year. We would, of course, remain laser-focus on being as efficient as we can possibly be while providing the level of services our customers expects. 
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate that our value creation as a result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas and our Associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is [indiscernible]. While fiscal 2016 has been somewhat more challenging than we previously expected, I am confident because our Associates share my conviction that during [indiscernible] efficiency and being a dynamic channel better with a view to the future is what sets ABC apart. Our dedication to continuous improvement and the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our thoughtful capital management all helped us grow our business in ways that would help ensure we generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come. 
Now, here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks in this morning will focus on our adjusted results.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks in this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter ended December 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. As a reminder, Steve highlighted that we closed [indiscernible] in early in November and the results are now included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. I have 2 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap our fiscal Q1 consolidated and segment performance, and second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations. 
With that, we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $36.7 billion, up just over 9%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continued to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. On a comparable basis to last year, which means excluding MWI, which is in our other statement, our ABC consolidated revenue growth rate would have been just under 7%. The quarter's adjusted profit increased 18% to $1.54 billion. The majority of the dollar growth was due to the 2 acquisitions that we made, most notably MWI. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year in the December 2014 quarter, we had a specially strong contribution from generic price appreciation, and we are still cycling through the repricing of the Department of Defense contract renewal. We anticipated these headwinds and we previously called them out. 
Operating expenses, our total adjusted OpEx increased 26% from $579 million, roughly 75% of the increase is related to our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these 2 companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been in the mid-single digits. Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $475 million, up about $40 million or 9%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down 1 basis point from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 10 basis points this quarter. 
Looking below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $29 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing costs for MWI and PharMEDium. Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 34.6% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. We continue to realize a higher percentage of our income from our international businesses, which include World Courier, our Ireland Bluepoint private label company and our ABC Switzerland company. As Steve mentioned, we continue to expand our service offerings to manufacturers in Switzerland, including the various exceptional launch of [indiscernible], a market-leading data portal. 
Looking ahead, as we continue to expand our international service offerings and formerly formally implement our ongoing R&D tax credit program, we now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 33.5%. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.27 driven mostly from the contributions of our acquisitions. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230 million shares, roughly flat to last year. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.2 billion, up nearly 7%. And as mentioned earlier by Steve, our Drug Company had a growth rate of over 5%, with solid growth across key customer segments, including independents, chain and alternate site. Contributors to this growth include overall market growth, the launch of new innovative drugs like the hepatitis C drugs and continued good brand pricing environment. I should point out that the Drug Company did have a slight revenue headwind this quarter of about 1.5% due to 2 previously announced customer losses. Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of 15% driven primarily by unit volume growth. This is the seventh consecutive quarter that our Specialty Group has grown top line revenues at 10% or above. Looking at it from a disease state standpoint, we have meaningful revenue growth in oncology across a few of our specialty businesses and also ophthalmology. Overall, we are very pleased with the continued performance of this key business group that helps to differentiate ABC. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $772 million, up about $20 million or about 3%. The growth in gross profit dollars was about evenly split between our 2 businesses, Drug Company and the Specialty Group. Drug Company, excluding the benefit from PharMEDium, was behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 large headwinds I called on previously, the tough comparison on generic price inflation and Department of Defense contract repricing. Segment operating income was $380 million and was down 3%. Our Specialty business continued with a high level of performance, offset by performance by our Drug Company due to the gross profit items I just called out. Wrapping up, even though it was a partial quarter for PharMEDium, this business is growing revenues and contributing operating income right in line with what we expected, so a very positive start. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the December quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the high single digits. Let me cover our last consulting business first. They have a very good quarter as a result of new and expanded support services, 2 existing manufacturer customers. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well. This is our third full quarter of owning MWI, and we are extremely pleased with the integration and progress made to date. The management team is laser-focused on servicing their customers and growing the business. On a comparable basis, MWI grew at companion revenues as a percentage in the mid-teens. We continue to see an expanding U.S. animal health care market driven by organic growth, new innovative products and a healthy drug pricing environment. From an operating income standpoint, this segment has operating income of nearly $96 million. MWI contributed the majority of the increase. Since we haven't anniversaried the acquisition yet, the consulting also helped to drive the exceptional result in this segment.  Let me point out that the operating margin is down some in the segment and MWI has a lower overall margin compared to our 2 businesses -- our other 2 businesses. So overall, mix is causing compression in the margin percentage. 
This completes our segment review, and let me switch and quickly cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants, as highlighted in the 8-K that we filed on November 23, we received a favorable IRS private letter ruling on the deductibility of the fair market of warrants upon the exercise. Our GAAP tax rate can this quarter's financial results now reflects the applicable tax accounting as a result of the ruling. Switching to our tax deduction, our deduction will be in a fair market value or the intrinsic value of the respective warrants at the time of exercise. Our cash tax benefit is essentially our effective tax rate multiplied by the tax deduction amount. It may take several quarters to actually monetize the deduction because we have to change our quarterly estimated tax payment and also potentially file for refund. LIFO this quarter, we recorded an expense of just over $1 million which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year fiscal '16 expense is expected to be less than the prior year due primarily to a slightly lower projected brand inflation rate. 
This wraps up our P&L review. I'd like to cover key working capital and cash flow items. In the December quarter, we had solid fee cash flow of $661 million. We continue to manage our working capital metrics closely, DSO, and number of days in inventory both remain relatively unchanged, even with our large top line growth. We ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet, with a relatively small percentage of this amount offshore. 
The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks and also our warrant hedging coverage. In October, we purchased 1.3 million shares or $190 million [ph] on our special share authorization to complete our previously announced March 2015 call option hedging strategy. These were the only shares purchased in the quarter. We highlighted on our year-end call that we limit our regular share repurchases as a result of the additional borrowings to partially fund the PharMEDium acquisition. As noted in our press release table and as we've said in the past, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise based on the ABC closing share price at December 31, 2015. This means we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreen's, most likely in March 2016. 
And now let's turn to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. I will provide guidance comments in a few key areas. Revenues, we continue to guide to ABC consolidated revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range for the full year, which included the new Publix account. Operating income, let me cover 3 items that are now impacting our full year operating income and margin. First, generic inflation trends. Previously, our fiscal '16 guidance factored in moderating generic price appreciation and consequently for ABC is translated to a lower dollar level of contribution versus fiscal '15. Now that we are starting our fifth month of our current fiscal year, we have had a longer period to evaluate generic pricing trends. We thought that we see some increased activity in January like we did last year, but it's still been especially slow. Based on this, our assumption around generic price appreciation has been updated. We now believe that generic inflation will be quite modest during the remaining 3 quarters of our fiscal year. The second item, we are also forecasting that contributions from new generic drugs will be less than expected. This includes [indiscernible] and infused oncology drug that we previously expected to convert to generic. However, based on a recent court ruling, the generic launch has now been delayed a couple of years. And the third item, as highlighted by Steve, we recently signed a new strategic long-term contract with CPA, an anchor customer to our independent retail segment. We made a proactive decision to renew roughly 1 year early so that we can start enhanced programs and initiatives with them to drive incremental business over the long term. 
To summarize just the items that I covered above, our full year fiscal 2016 operating growth has slowed. As a result, we now expect our top operating margin will increase 3 to 5 basis points, down from the previous guidance of an increase of 8 to 12 basis points. Adjusted EPS we now expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.83, which still reflects strong growth of 15% to 18% from last year's adjusted EPS. Free cash flow, our guidance that we previously provided, $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, remains unchanged since we are still early in our fiscal year.  As I wrap up, I'd like to add that we did purchase approximately $100 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program in January, but a continued top priority for ABC is to reduce a portion of the debt associated with our recent acquisitions. However, as always, this is subject to reviewing our cash flow, market conditions and other competing capital needs. 
So in summary, a solid quarter and start to the year. However, we will be working through the impact of 2 incremental headwinds this fiscal year that weren't previously expected, along with renewing and anchor customer to a unique 9-year contract. As always, we continue to drive efficiencies in our business, while delivering value to all of our customers. We remain committed to growing our adjusted EPS in a meaningful way in fiscal '16 by focusing on what we do best, servicing our customers, deploying capital appropriately and making the right decisions to grow our business for the long run. 
As always, we greatly appreciate your interest at ABC. Now here is Barbara to start our Q&A."

We have some very strong competitors that we compete against but I think we are well-positioned I was at the sales meeting on the call. So that's already performing in our expectations. It has done well because of some economics circumstances, the companion animal business has actually done especially well, and again we keep on adding new services there. PharMEDium, just really 2 months that we reported and they're closing in early November, we're happy we made a few changes. We haven't had surprises. We, of course, are very mindful of the regulatory environment and trying to go to where the pack is going, make sure that we are ahead of regulators. But it's a business that we grow to earn. Customers is being good. But that is going to take long part of any synergy on the business development side with PharMEDium and our health systems business. And enhance overall discussion ads our strategic relevance, so we like the acquisition. I will tell you that the growth profile in this business, especially the way that they can just do more business with the current customers, we are almost penetrated, we do for the customer. On the prescription side, this is a whole new way for them to grow and they keep on adding new therapies that they're offering us the customer that offered services. We are really pleased about that. Getting back to your questions as far as the growth rate, you will see we have a lot of investment with WBA and the real -- the number of SKUs that we're distributing to our business has really increased significantly and we really caught up with that investment now.

I am pleased with our results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and I commend our associates for the tremendous value they provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel. Day in and day out, they are focused on creating value for all of our stakeholders and ultimately, for the patients we all serve. We play a vital role in the provision of health care, which is grounded in our dedication to operational excellence, our continuous improvement in efficiency and our bold embrace of innovation.
Everything we do is ultimately driven by one objective, enabling high-quality pharmaceutical care for patients. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed and our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing creative solutions to the challenges inherent in today's health care marketplace. The proficiency with which we run our business creates value for all of our stakeholders and enables us to strategically position ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are unfolding in a rapidly changing landscape.
Tim will provide the details on our financial performance in the quarter, but I want to highlight a few items. Revenues were up 9% in the December quarter to $36.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.27, an impressive result considering the strong performance in the prior year. We are making good progress on our free cash flow objectives for the year, generating $661 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2016.
In addition, we have continued to manage strategic investments in our business in order to position ourselves well to meet the changing needs of our customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities. In November, we closed the acquisition of PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compound and sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. Health systems are playing an increasingly important role in patient care. And this acquisition represents a significant investment in our ability to provide market-leading services [indiscernible] solutions to this key customer segment.
PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality CSPs in select therapeutic areas, combined with the impressive track record of growth, makes them a compelling addition to ABDC. We are very pleased that PharMEDium's new state-of-the-art facility based in New Jersey is now open and providing high-quality sterile IV products to their customers. This new facility firmly enhances their capabilities and capacity and will be critical to supporting the future growth we expect in this business.
The integration work with ABDC is going very well, and PharMEDium is on track to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and to our health systems customers for many years to come. As we have previously discussed, in addition to making investments in our business, we have also clipped [ph] our commitment to our shareholders and have virtually completely offset the expected impact of exercises of the warrants held by Walgreens Boots Alliance we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017.
While the only share repurchases in the December quarter were under the special program and related to warrant hedging, we did repurchase $100 million under our normal share repurchases program in January. I'm very proud of the financial stewardship we have demonstrated over the years, and we remain disciplined in the deployment of capital.
We are fortunate to be part of a unique and very successful industry that is excelled by constantly working to take costs out of the health care system by helping to ensure that patients have the widest possible access to the medications their physicians prescribe for them. The industry is competitive and stable in large part because we enjoy a solid level of organic market growth, but also because the participants in this industry are sophisticated enterprises that have made important investments in infrastructure and technology in order to continuously improve the most efficient and secure pharmaceutical supply chain in the world.
Today, our expertise extends well beyond the modern aggregation [ph] and logistics. We help enable pharmaceutical care, serving manufacturers as they strive to develop new products and get them to market and health care providers as they focus on expertly improving patient outcomes while managing the cost of care.
AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned within this industry to help support the entire life cycle of growth and to ensure patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapies across all sites of care. We work with thousands of manufacturers and make daily deliveries to tens of thousands of customers, efficiently turning our inventory to maintain an order flow rate of more than 99%. We work effectively in a highly regulated environment, maintain the flexibility to respond to emergencies on demand and we do show at an exceptionally low cost. In many patients -- in many cases, patients' lives are at stake, and our associates never hesitate to creatively solve problems and meet whatever challenges might be in front of them.
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a solid quarter, with revenues up 5%, driven in large part by solid organic volume growth, offset in part by some previously announced lost business. Our retail chain, mail order and hospital customers all had strong revenue growth in the quarter. ABDC is however working through some tough compressions this year, and generic inflation in particular is declining more than we had originally anticipated. As always, we continue to remain focused on driving efficiency in operations without sacrificing the service we are able to provide our customers.
We also are committed to making investments in our business that will position us well to take advantage of future opportunities. These activities are critical to securing future growth. Just this week, we began servicing over 900 Publix stores with our brand specialty products and some of the generic [indiscernible] in their food-and-drug combination stores. This is a great example of how we continue to support access to specialty products across all sites of care.
One of the unique aspects of this distribution agreement is that Publix will utilize our RFID-enabled Cubixx, specialty drug inventory cabinets, as they further deliver -- develop their specialty pharmacy offerings. In addition, Publix will have access to the full breadth of our knowledge and expertise in this area, and we look forward to a long-term collaborative relationship with this key growing food and drug retailer.
In January, we saw an early renewal in a 9-year contact extension with our largest independent pharmacy group purchasing organization customer, Compliance Pharmacy Alliance or CPA. CPA is one of the most innovative groups of independent pharmacy owners and has become an important anchor customer in our independent retail segment with 1,225 member stores. Since we first began our relationship back in 2009, they have nearly doubled the number of member stores. Their impressive growth, the high-quality leadership they provide in independent pharmacy and the value they place on one of [ph] our Good Neighbor Pharmacy programs, made them an exceptional long-term partner. Both the CPA contract and the Publix contract further strengthen our high-quality retail customer base and provide opportunity for future growth.
We also are pleased with the performance in our health systems customers this quarter. Our acute-care customers increasingly provides some of the most important touch points for patient care. These customers now represent one of the fastest-growing segments we serve in ABDC, and the investments we have made in targeted programs and services for this channel is paying off.
For example, both our ProGenerics programs and our private-label generic program BluePoint today serve hospitals as well as retailers. And of course, as I mentioned, earlier, we closed the PharMEDium acquisition during the quarter, and we have made excellent progress on the integration of this business. I am very excited by what our health systems customers bring to ABC, and we continue to explore ways to bring innovative new solutions to help address the challenges they face in a rapidly changing market.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results 
in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving revenues up 13%. Our community oncology business in particular had a strong quarter, and our physician distribution businesses also had a good quarter. Our market leadership in specialty is rooted in intimate knowledge of our customers and long and deep experience in the marketplace. The expertise we have in this area and the portfolio of services we have developed over many years extends well beyond specialty logistics. We hope [ph] manufacturers and health care providers manage the distinct requirements for a specific disease state and unique classes [ph] of products.
Our collaborative approach in this area has been the foundation upon which we have established ourselves as the preferred partner for specialty products and services and gives us the firm footing in this most vibrant and dynamic area of the marketplace. In the market, they've increasingly focused on the cost of care. The best way to discover and deliver value in the long run is to work in concert with our business partners. One of the ways we accomplish this is through our global supply and manufacturer relations business unit based in Bern, Switzerland, also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. We have made important progress in the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of sophistication and coordination between manufacturers and our customers.
In October, the Switzerland team's launched Certio, a new portal that provides business insights and customized reporting for our generics manufacturer partners. Certio offers realtime access to AmerisourceBergen sales data as well as inventory management and sales forecasting tools. The Swiss-based platform also offers a flexibility to schedule and receive customized reports based on the manufacturers' business needs. Certio's value is evidenced by its rapid adoption and usage with virtually all of our generic manufacturer partners accessing the system.
Looking ahead, we continue to review the possibility to expand the breakthrough [ph] reports and data for manufacturers, helping them make more informed decisions and supporting their efforts to improve supply chain efficiency for their products.
Let's turn now to the Other segment. This segment continues to benefit from the inclusion of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and a few investments to help them continue to meet their long-term objectives. The companion animal business was especially strong in the December quarter as MWI benefited from strong organic growth, new product introductions and healthy pricing environment. We are very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016 and will make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we continue to grow our presence in the complex animal health segment.
Just this week, I entered the MWI National Sales Conference in Orlando, and I was reminded again of the strong culture of MWI. The excellent fit with ABC and the significant industry presence that MWI has in animal health, which is exemplified by their demand-generating sales force.
Our manufacture services businesses also had a solid December quarter, with Lash Group in particular performing very well as they grew their business with key manufacturer customers. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Our increasingly global reach in this area further expands our value proposition to manufacturers.
We continuously seek out ways to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products, whether through World Courier in the clinical trial phase or through our consulting business in the commercialization phases. When we combine these unique capabilities with the other programs and services ABC offers, we are increasingly able to effectively support products launched in most of the developed world.
As I said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. We are well positioned in all of our customer segments, and we are proud to service flagship customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance with the pharmaceuticals they need to meet the needs of their patients on a daily basis.
While we face headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, we are well positioned to deliver 50% to 80% adjusted earnings per share growth in the years following 2 consecutive years on which we deliver growth over 2015. Tim will provide the details on our revised guidance. And while I'm disappointed that we no longer believe we can achieve the high end of our original EPS guidance range for fiscal 2016, we remain on track to deliver strong revenue growth and substantial free cash flow over the course of the year. We would, of course, remain laser focused on being as efficient as we can possibly be while providing the level of services our customers expect.
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate that our value creation is a result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas, and our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is built. While fiscal 2016 has been somewhat more challenging than we first expected, I am confident because our associates share my conviction that [indiscernible] the efficiency and being a dynamic channel partner with a view to the future is what sets ABC apart. Our dedication to continuous improvement and the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our thoughtful capital management all help us grow our business in ways that would help ensure we generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks in this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter ended December 2015 compared to the same period o",2046,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks in this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter ended December 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted.
As a reminder, Steve highlighted that we closed PharMEDium in early in November, and the results are now included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. I have 2 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap our fiscal Q1 consolidated and segment performance. And second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations.
With that, we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $36.7 billion, up just over 9%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continued to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. On a comparable basis to last year, which means excluding MWI, which is in our Other segment, our ABC consolidated revenue growth rate would have been just under 7%. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 18% to $1,054,000,000. The majority of the dollar growth was due to the 2 acquisitions that we've made, most notably MWI. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year in the December 2014 quarter, we had an especially strong contribution from generic price appreciation, and we are still cycling through the repricing of the Department of Defense contract renewal. We anticipated these headwinds and we previously called them out.
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 26% from $579 million. Roughly 75% of the increase is related to our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these 2 companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been in the mid-single digits.
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $475 million, up about $40 million or 9%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down 1 basis point from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 10 basis points this quarter.
Looking below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $29 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing costs for MWI and PharMEDium. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 34.6% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. We continue to realize a higher percentage of our income from our international businesses, which include World Courier, our Ireland BluePoint private label company and our ABC Switzerland company. As Steve mentioned, we continue to expand our service offerings to manufacturers in Switzerland, including the very successful launch of Certio, a market-leading data portal.
Looking ahead, as we continue to expand our international service offerings and formally implement an ongoing R&D tax credit program, we now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 33.5%. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.27, driven mostly from the contributions of our acquisitions. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230 million shares, roughly flat to last year.
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.2 billion, up nearly 7%. And as mentioned earlier by Steve, our drug company had a growth rate of over 5%, with solid growth across key customer segments, including independents, chain and alternate site. Contributors to this growth include overall market growth, the launch of new innovative drugs like the hepatitis C drugs and a continued good brand pricing environment. I should point out that the drug company did have a slight revenue headwind this quarter of about 1.5% due to 2 previously announced customer losses.
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of 15%, driven primarily by unit volume growth. This is the seventh consecutive quarter that our specialty group has grown top line revenues at 10% or above. Looking at it from a disease state standpoint, we had meaningful revenue growth in oncology across a few of our specialty businesses and also ophthalmology. Overall, we are very pleased with the continued performance of this key business group that helps to differentiate ABC.
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $772 million, up about $20 million or about 3%. The growth in gross profit dollars was about evenly split between our 2 businesses, drug company and the specialty group. Drug company, excluding the benefit from PharMEDium, was behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 large headwinds I called on previously, the tough comparison on generic price inflation and Department of Defense contract repricing. Segment operating income was $380 million and was down 3%. Our specialty business continued with their high level of performance, offset by lower [ph] performance by our drug company due to the gross profit items I just called out. Wrapping up, even though it was the partial quarter for PharMEDium, this business is growing revenues and contributing operating income right in line with what we expected, so a very positive start.
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the December quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the high single digits.
Let me cover our last consulting business first. They had a very good quarter as a result of new and expanded support services to existing manufacturer customers. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well. This is our third full quarter of owning MWI, and we are extremely pleased with the integration and progress made to date. The management team is laser-focused on servicing their customers and growing the business.
On a comparable basis, MWI grew at companion revenues as a percentage in the mid-teens. We continue to see an expanding U.S. animal health market driven by organic growth, new innovative products and a healthy drug pricing environment. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of nearly $96 million. MWI contributed the majority of the increase. Since we haven't anniversaried the acquisition yet, consulting also helped to drive the exceptional result in this segment. Let me point out that the operating margin is down some in the segment as MWI has a lower overall margin compared to our 2 businesses -- our 2 other businesses. So overall, mix is causing compression in the margin percentage.
This completes our segment review, and let me switch and quickly cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants, as highlighted in the 8-K that we filed on November 23, we received a favorable IRS private letter ruling on the deductibility of the fair market value of warrants upon the exercise. Our GAAP tax rate in this quarter's financial results now reflects the applicable tax accounting as a result of the ruling.
Switching to our tax deduction. Our deduction will be in a fair market value or the intrinsic value of the respective warrants at the time of exercise. Our cash tax benefit is essentially our effective tax rate multiplied by the tax deduction amount. It may take several quarters to actually monetize the deduction because we'll have to change our quarterly estimated tax payment and also potentially file for refunds.
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expense of just over $1 million, which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year fiscal '16 expense is expected to be less than the prior year due primarily to a slightly lower projected brand inflation rate.
This wraps up our P&L review. I'd like to cover key working capital and cash flow items. In the December quarter, we had solid free cash flow of $661 million. We continue to manage our working capital metrics closely. DSO and number of days in inventory both remain relatively unchanged, even with our large top line growth. We ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet with a relatively small percentage of this amount offshore.
The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks and also our warrant hedging coverage. In October, we purchased 1.3 million shares or $119 million under our special share authorization to complete our previously announced March 2015 call option hedging strategy. These were the only shares purchased in the quarter. We highlighted on our year-end call that we limit our regular share repurchases as a result of the additional borrowings to partially fund the PharMEDium acquisition.
As noted in our press release table and as we've said in the past, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise based on the ABC closing share price at December 31, 2015. This means we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreens most likely in March 2016.
Now let's turn to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. I will provide guidance comments in a few key areas. Revenues. We continue to guide the ABC consolidated revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range for the full year, which included the new Publix account. Operating income, let me cover 3 items that are now impacting our full year operating income and margin.
First, generic inflation trends. Previously, our fiscal '16 guidance factored in moderating generic price appreciation. And consequently, for ABC, this translated to a lower dollar level of contribution versus fiscal '15. Now that we are starting our fifth month of our current fiscal year, we have had a longer period to evaluate generic pricing trends. We thought that we see some increased activity in January like we did last year, but it's still been especially slow. Based on this, our assumption around generic price appreciation has been updated. We now believe that generic inflation will be quite modest during the remaining 3 quarters of our fiscal year.
The second item, we are also forecasting that contributions from new generic drugs will be less than expected. This includes ALOXI, an infused oncology drug, and we previously expected to convert to generic. However, based on a recent court ruling, the generic launch has now been delayed a couple of years.
And the third item, as highlighted by Steve, we recently signed a new strategic long-term contract with CPA, an anchor customer to our independent retail segment. We made a proactive decision to renew roughly 1 year early so that we can start enhanced programs and initiatives with them to drive incremental business over the long term.
To summarize just [ph] the items that I covered above, our full year fiscal '16 operating growth has slowed. As a result, we now expect that our operating margin will increase 3 to 5 basis points, down from the previous guidance of an increase of 8 to 12 basis points. Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.83, which still reflects strong growth of 15% to 18% from last year's adjusted EPS. Free cash flow. Our guidance that we previously provided, $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, remains unchanged since we are still early in our fiscal year.
As I wrap up, I'd like to add that we did purchase approximately $100 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program in January. But a continued top priority for ABC is to reduce a portion of the debt associated with our recent acquisitions. However, as always, this is subject to reviewing our cash flow, market conditions and other competing capital needs.
So in summary, a solid quarter and start to the year. However, we will be working through the impacts of 2 incremental headwinds this fiscal year that weren't previously expected, along with renewing an anchor customer to a unique 9-year contract. As always, we continue to drive efficiencies in our business while delivering value to all of our customers. We remain committed to growing our adjusted EPS in a meaningful way in fiscal '16 by focusing on what we do best, servicing our customers, deploying capital appropriately and making the right decisions to grow our business for the long run.
As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

Of course, we like to have historical outperformance, [ph] so it was something that we had to take into account. But when you're [ph] always there, it was somewhat unpredictable. We don't have product information. So I would just say that ABC and our industry has proved to be very resilient, scrappy, [ph] we've gone through a change in repeated [ph] service, the huge patent expirations that we've experienced in the past few years. We've had some specific events in specialty like oxaliplatin. And we've crossed, [ph] putting both the inflationary and deflationary tasks. So our manufacturer contracts protect us on the downside for deflation. And the key to us is always increasing volume and to have the right scale. And that's why I think that [indiscernible] Alliance is so powerful. We entered into that before we started experiencing significant inflation because we felt by being global, we felt like really going into a partnership with the largest retailer, what is the right way to make sure that we always had to compare the pricing on generics in a profitable environment, whatever we saw in the market. So I think we've made a lot of smart moves. And I will just say that we are confident we can make money in a deflationary environment than we have historically as well."

We have it with, of course, WBA. We have it in dialysis with DaVita and Fresenius. So we have a lot of these just tremendous accounts.

Those anchor customers that I talked about and many other customers that are so important to overall growth. And then you also look at our specialty presence and our specialty market share. So we feel excited about the future. We have a lot of other levers that we continue to pull around operating excellence, more analysis, better long-term contracting with more information. We have expense efficiency that we continue to be very thoughtful about. And then, of course, that thoughtful capital deployment, which I think almost everyone would give us high marks on, whether it's the right dividend policy or the right share repurchases, the right internal investments which we make, many of which are so critical to our growth. We talked about one here in AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, but there's lots of examples of those really strategic internal investments we've made, which are probably among the best ROIC that we get on any investment. So I'd tell you, I'm excited about the future. I think we've got good prospects. And I would remind you that, again, we're talking about in 2016, 15% to 18% growth after 2 years of 20% plus. So how many companies that have a revenue growth rate of approximately $150 billion are doing that? So again, this is a great industry, and I think the outlook for us really highlights that."

But can you maybe just help us to think about this business model in general and maybe what are some of the drivers to the lever to the model off of that revenue number? And then secondly, just to understand some of the acquisitions that you've made recently, for example, like PharMEDium, and the impact that they can have because as we just think about the revision to the EBIT growth, right, or the margin expansion, I think we're just trying to work through the different impacts, how much that potentially is generic drug price inflation versus repricing and the benefit of some of these higher-margin businesses that you bought.

It's performing very well as is MWI. MWI, of course, is in a similar sort of industry from a competitive perspective as we are, where they have some very strong competitors that we compete against, but I think we are well positioned. I was at their sales meeting as I said on the call. So they're already performing at expectations. And I think they have done well because of some economic circumstances. The companion animal business has actually done especially well. And again, we keep on adding new services there. PharMEDium, just really 2 months that we reported, and they're closing in early November. We're happy. We made a few changes. We haven't had surprises. We, of course, are very mindful of the regulatory environment and trying to go to where the pack is going, make sure that we are ahead of regulators. But it's a business that we grow to own. The response from customers has been good. But I'd say it's going to take long for there to be really any synergy on the business development side with PharMEDium and our health systems business. But it adds to the overall discussion level, it adds to our strategic relevance, so we like the acquisition. I will tell you that the growth profile in this business, especially the way that they can just do more business with their current customers or not. We are almost fully penetrated. We do all the needs for our health system customers. On the prescription side, this is a whole new way for them to grow is they keep on adding new therapies to their offerings as the customers get to like their service. So we are really pleased around that. Getting back to your question as far as the growth rate, you will see we've had a lot of investment because of WBA and the real -- the number of SKU that we're distributing through our business has really increased significantly. And we've really caught up with that investment now. We would hope to continue investing in the network, making sure it's the most updated, efficient. And we do expect our total customers to carry on growing. So the model is very leverageable, and I think you can look at the long history we have had of creating efficiencies. So I would say it's leverageable. We've just had some occurrences here with not having a strong generic launch period in this quarter and probably the March quarter, and also the inflation that we talked about as well as some tough comps on the DoD and the renewal on CPA, which I could tell you we've done for all the right reasons. So Tim has something to add."

The change in our tax rate is related to international mix being very planful and thoughtful about growing international business, seeing the tax rate come down because of that, and also we're implementing a formal R&D tax credit program related to technology.

And one of their board members was very emotional or must have been and talked about the responsibility they have to their patients, to their employees, to the different members. And it is kind of a voluntary group that they get together for various reasons. And the fact that they were willing to commit to ABC, we took as a good sign. So we went ahead and there wasn't a formal RFP process. And that's actually how a lot of our industry works. Customers like staying with their current wholesaler in most cases. And absent some change in ownership or that, a lot of our customers do tend to stay with us even though it's a very competitive environment.

And at that stage, it was 2 separate companies. Of course, now they've come together. So that was a key driver. And the contracting process is really -- it's not necessarily that you've seen one and you've seen them all. We've tried to have a fairly wide sourcing philosophy, and that's true both at ABC and at WBAD. So we think we're very well positioned, and that puts our customers in a good position and it puts our relationship with the suppliers in a good position.

So my comments on meeting with the drug company management team was around what sort of growth can we expect going forward. And I'll tell you that the drug company has a lot of levers. So we're not -- it's not specifically on margin because it's too early, but it's really around what growth rate do we expect for the drug company. And those gross profit dollars are very important to us as well as they are to our shareholders. And of course, no business is more working capital efficient than our drug company. So that's another key value driver that we look for from the drug company. So my comment was really around when we do meet with Bob Mauch and his team, it's not -- we expect them to be generating growth next year."

I am pleased with our results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and I commend our associates for the tremendous value they provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel. Day in and day out, they are focused o",2290,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and I commend our associates for the tremendous value they provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel. Day in and day out, they are focused on creating value for all of our stakeholders and ultimately, for the patients we all serve. We play a vital role in the provision of health care, which is grounded in our dedication to operational excellence, our continuous improvement in efficiency and our bold embrace of innovation.
Everything we do is ultimately driven by one objective, enabling high-quality pharmaceutical care for patients. The unique knowledge and expertise we have developed and our partnership philosophy and our increasingly global reach enable us to influence and shape health care delivery by providing creative solutions to the challenges inherent in today's health care marketplace. The proficiency with which we run our business creates value for all of our stakeholders and enables us to strategically position ourselves to take advantage of opportunities that are unfolding in a rapidly changing landscape.
Tim will provide the details on our financial performance in the quarter, but I want to highlight a few items. Revenues were up 9% in the December quarter to $36.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.27, an impressive result considering the strong performance in the prior year. We are making good progress on our free cash flow objectives for the year, generating $661 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2016.
In addition, we have continued to manage strategic investments in our business in order to position ourselves well to meet the changing needs of our customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities. In November, we closed the acquisition of PharMEDium, the premier national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations to acute care hospitals in the U.S. Health systems are playing an increasingly important role in patient care. And this acquisition represents a significant investment in our ability to provide market-leading services and resolutions to this key customer segment.
PharMEDium's proven ability to consistently deliver high-quality CSPs in select therapeutic areas, combined with the impressive track record of growth, makes them a compelling addition to ABDC. We are very pleased that PharMEDium's new state-of-the-art facility based in New Jersey is now open and providing high-quality sterile IV products to their customers. This new facility firmly enhances their capabilities and capacity and will be critical to supporting the future growth we expect in this business.
The integration work with ABDC is going very well, and PharMEDium is on track to make a significant contribution to our fiscal 2016 and to our health systems customers for many years to come. 
As we have previously discussed, in addition to making investments in our business, we have also kept our commitment to our shareholders and have virtually completely offset the expected impact of exercises of the warrants held by Walgreens Boots Alliance we anticipate in fiscal 2016 and 2017.
While the only share repurchases in the December quarter were under the special program and related to warrant hedging, we did repurchase $100 million under our normal share repurchases program in January. I'm very proud of the financial stewardship we have demonstrated over the years, and we remain disciplined in the deployment of capital.
We are fortunate to be part of a unique and very successful industry that has excelled by constantly working to take costs out of the health care system while helping to ensure that patients have the widest possible access to the medications their physicians prescribe for them. The industry is competitive but stable in large part because we enjoy a solid level of organic market growth, but also because the participants in this industry are sophisticated enterprises that have made important investments in infrastructure and technology in order to continuously improve the most efficient and secure pharmaceutical supply chain in the world.
Today, our expertise extends well beyond demand aggregation and logistics. We help enable pharmaceutical care, serving manufacturers as they strive to develop new products and get them to market and health care providers as they focus on expertly improving patient outcomes while managing the cost of care.
AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned within this industry to help support the entire life cycle of growth and to ensure patients have access to both traditional and complex new therapies across all sites of care. We work with thousands of manufacturers and make daily deliveries to tens of thousands of customers, efficiently turning our inventory to maintain an order fill rate of more than 99%. We work effectively in a highly regulated environment, maintain the flexibility to respond to emergencies on demand and we do so at an exceptionally low cost. In many patients -- in many cases, patients' lives are at stake, and our associates never hesitate to creatively solve problems and meet whatever challenges might be in front of them.
Let's turn now to the performance of AmerisourceBergen in the September quarter. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had a solid quarter, with revenues up 5%, driven in large part by solid organic volume growth, offset in part by some previously announced lost business. Our retail chain, mail order and hospital customers all had strong revenue growth in the quarter. ABDC is however working through some tough comparisons this year, and generic inflation in particular is declining more than we had originally anticipated. As always, we continue to remain focused on driving efficiency in operations without sacrificing the service we are able to provide our customers.
We also are committed to making investments in our business that will position us well to take advantage of future opportunities. These activities are critical to securing future growth. Just this week, we began servicing over 900 Publix stores with a brand, specialty products and some of the generics that they dispense in their food-and-drug combination stores. This is a great example of how we continue to support access to specialty products across all sites of care.
One of the unique aspects of this distribution agreement is that Publix will utilize our RFID-enabled Cubixx, specialty drug inventory cabinets, as they further deliver -- develop their specialty pharmacy offerings. In addition, Publix will have access to the full breadth of our knowledge and expertise in this area, and we look forward to a long-term collaborative relationship with this key growing food and drug retailer.
In January, we signed an early renewal and a 9-year contract extension with our largest independent pharmacy group purchasing organization customer, Compliant Pharmacy Alliance or CPA. CPA is one of the most innovative groups of independent pharmacy owners and has become an important anchor customer in our independent retail segment with 1,225 member stores. Since we first began our relationship back in 2009, they have nearly doubled the number of member stores. Their impressive growth, the high-quality leadership they provide in independent pharmacy and the value they place upon our Good Neighbor Pharmacy programs, made them an exceptional long-term partner. Both the CPA contract and the Publix contract further strengthen our high-quality retail customer base and provide opportunity for future growth.
We also are pleased with the performance in our health systems customers this quarter. Our acute-care customers increasingly provide some of the most important touch points for patient care. These customers now represent one of the fastest-growing segments we serve in ABDC, and the investments we have made in targeted programs and services for this channel is paying off.
For example, both our ProGenerics programs and our private-label generic program, BluePoint, today serve hospitals as well as retailers. And of course, as I mentioned, earlier, we closed the PharMEDium acquisition during the quarter, and we have made excellent progress on the integration of this business. I am very excited by what our health systems customers bring to ABC, and we continue to explore ways to bring innovative new solutions to help address the challenges they face in a rapidly changing market.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group again had impressive results 
in the quarter, with a number of different factors driving revenues up 15%. Our community oncology business in particular had a strong quarter, and our physician distribution businesses also had a good quarter. Our market leadership in specialty is rooted in intimate knowledge of our customers and long and deep experience in the marketplace. The expertise we have in this area and the portfolio of services we have developed over many years extends well beyond specialty logistics. We help manufacturers and health care providers manage the distinct requirements for a specific disease states and unique classes of products.
Our collaborative approach in this area has been the foundation upon which we have established ourselves as the preferred partner for specialty products and services and gives us the firm footing in this most vibrant and dynamic area of the marketplace. In a market that is increasingly focused on the cost of care the best way to discover and deliver value in the long run is to work in concert with our business partners. One of the ways we accomplish this is through our global supply and manufacturer relations business unit based in Bern, Switzerland, also known as AmerisourceBergen Switzerland. We have made important progress in the brand, specialty, generic and consumer areas to establish an even greater level of sophistication and coordination between manufacturers and our customers.
In October, the Switzerland teams launched Certio, a new portal that provides business insights and customized reporting for our generics manufacturer partners. Certio offers real-time access to AmerisourceBergen sales data as well as inventory management and sales forecasting tools. The Swiss-based platform also offers a flexibility to schedule and receive customized reports based on the manufacturers' business needs. Certio's value is evidenced by its rapid adoption and usage with virtually all of our generic manufacturer partners accessing the system.
Looking ahead, we continue to review the possibility to expand the breadth of reports and data for manufacturers, helping them make more informed decisions and supporting their efforts to improve supply chain efficiency for their products.
Let's turn now to the Other segment. This segment continues to benefit from the inclusion of MWI in our results, and we are very pleased with their performance. We have made excellent progress on the integration and a few investments to help them continue to meet their long-term objectives. The companion animal business was especially strong in the December quarter as MWI benefited from strong organic growth, new product introductions and healthy pricing environment. We are very confident that MWI will continue to deliver excellent performance in fiscal 2016 and will make important differentiated contributions to the value we provide to the pharmaceutical supply channel as we continue to grow our presence in the complex animal health segment.
Just this week, I attended the MWI National Sales Conference in Orlando, and I was reminded again of the strong culture at MWI. The excellent fit with ABC and the significant industry presence that MWI has in animal health, which is exemplified by their demand-generating sales force.
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a solid December quarter, with Lash Group in particular performing very well as they grew their business with key manufacturer customers. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Our increasingly global reach in this area further expands our value proposition to manufacturers.
We continuously seek out ways to expand our ability to offer complex solutions for high-value pharmaceutical products, whether through World Courier in the clinical trial phase or through our consulting business in the commercialization phases. When we combine these unique capabilities with the other programs and services ABC offers, we are increasingly able to effectively support products launched in most of the developed world.
As I said many times before, it is a great time to be in the pharmaceutical services industry in both the human and animal health segments. We are well positioned in all of our customer segments, and we are proud to service flagship customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance with the pharmaceuticals they need to meet the needs of their patients on a daily basis.
While we face headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, we are well positioned to deliver 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth in the year following 2 consecutive years in which we delivered growth over 20%. Tim will provide the details on our revised guidance. And while I'm disappointed that we no longer believe we can achieve the high end of our original EPS guidance range for fiscal 2016, we remain on track to deliver strong revenue growth and substantial free cash flow over the course of the year. We would, of course, remain laser-focused on being as efficient as we can possibly be while providing the level of services our customers expect.
Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate that our value creation is a result of flawless execution, creative thinking and the courage to implement bold new ideas, and our associates are the firm foundation upon which our performance is built. While fiscal 2016 has been somewhat more challenging than we first expected, I have confidence because our associates share my conviction that doing things efficiently and being a dynamic channel partner with a view to the future is what sets ABC apart. Our dedication to continuous improvement in the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution and our thoughtful capital management all help us grow our business in ways that will help ensure we generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks in this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the first quarter ended December 2015 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted.
As a reminder, Steve highlighted that we closed PharMEDium in early in November, and the results are now included in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. I have 2 main topics to cover this morning. First, I will recap our fiscal Q1 consolidated and segment performance. And second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations.
With that, we can begin our Q1 review. Revenues were $36.7 billion, up just over 9%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continued to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. On a comparable basis to last year, which means excluding MWI, which is in our Other segment, our ABC consolidated revenue growth rate would have been just under 7%. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 18% to $1,054,000,000. The majority of the dollar growth was due to the 2 acquisitions that we made, most notably MWI. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year in the December 2014 quarter, we had an especially strong contribution from generic price appreciation, and we are still cycling through the repricing of the Department of Defense contract renewal. We anticipated these headwinds and we previously called them out.
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 26% from $579 million. Roughly 75% of the increase is related to our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these 2 companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been in the mid-single digits.
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $475 million, up about $40 million or 9%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.29%, down 1 basis point from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 10 basis points this quarter.
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $29 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing costs for MWI and PharMEDium. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 34.6% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. We continue to realize a higher percentage of our income from our international businesses, which include World Courier, our Ireland BluePoint private label company and our ABC Switzerland company. As Steve mentioned, we continue to expand our service offerings to manufacturers from Switzerland, including the very successful launch of Certio, a market-leading data portal.
Looking ahead, as we continue to expand our international service offerings and formally implement an ongoing R&D tax credit program, we now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 33.5%. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.27, driven mostly from the contributions of our acquisitions. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 230 million shares, roughly flat to last year.
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.2 billion, up nearly 7%. And as mentioned earlier by Steve, our drug company had a growth rate of over 5%, with solid growth across key customer segments, including independents, chain and alternate site. Contributors to this growth include overall market growth, the launch of new innovative drugs like the hepatitis C drugs and a continued good brand pricing environment. I should point out that the drug company did have a slight revenue headwind this quarter of about 1.5% due to 2 previously announced customer losses.
Our specialty business group had an overall revenue increase of 15%, driven primarily by unit volume growth. This is the seventh consecutive quarter that our specialty group has grown top line revenues at 10% or above. Looking at it from a disease state standpoint, we had meaningful revenue growth in oncology across a few of our specialty businesses and also ophthalmology. Overall, we are very pleased with the continued performance of this key business group that helps to differentiate ABC.
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $772 million, up about $20 million or about 3%. The growth in gross profit dollars was about evenly split between our 2 businesses, drug company and the specialty group. Drug company, excluding the benefit from PharMEDium, was behind last year's gross profit due to the 2 large headwinds I called out previously, the tough comparison on generic price inflation and the Department of Defense contract repricing. Segment operating income was $380 million and was down 3%. Our specialty business continued with their high level of performance, offset by lower performance by our drug company due to the gross profit items I just called out. Wrapping up, even though it was the partial quarter for PharMEDium, this business is growing revenues and contributing operating income right in line with what we expected, so a very positive start.
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI. In the December quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. On a comparable basis, so excluding MWI, revenue growth would have been, as a percentage, in the high single digits.
Let me cover our last consulting business first. They had a very good quarter as a result of new and expanded support services to existing manufacturer customers. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well. This is our third full quarter of owning MWI, and we are extremely pleased with the integration and progress made to date. The management team is laser-focused on servicing their customers and growing the business.
On a comparable basis, MWI grew with companion revenues as a percentage in the mid-teens. We continue to see an expanding U.S. animal health market driven by organic growth, new innovative products and a healthy drug pricing environment. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of nearly $96 million. MWI contributed the majority of the increase. Since we haven't anniversaried the acquisition yet, but consulting also helped to drive the exceptional result in this segment. Let me point out that the operating margin is down some in the segment as MWI has a lower overall margin compared to our 2 businesses -- our 2 other businesses. So overall, mix is causing compression in the margin percentage.
This completes our segment review, and let me switch and quickly cover our 2 large GAAP items, warrants and LIFO. Warrants is highlighted in the 8-K that we filed on November 23. We received a favorable IRS private letter ruling on the deductibility of the fair market value of warrants upon the exercise. Our GAAP tax rate in this quarter's financial results now reflects the applicable tax accounting as a result of the ruling.
Switching to our tax deduction. Our deduction will be the a fair market value or the intrinsic value of the respective warrants at the time of exercise. Our cash tax benefit is essentially our effective tax rate multiplied by the tax deduction amount. It may take several quarters to actually monetize the deduction because we'll have to change our quarterly estimated tax payment and also potentially file for refunds.
LIFO. This quarter, we recorded an expense of just over $100 million, which represents about 25% of our full year estimate. Our full year fiscal '16 expense is expected to be less than the prior year due primarily to a slightly lower projected brand inflation rate.  This wraps up our P&L review. 
I'd like to cover key working capital and cash flow items. In the December quarter, we had solid free cash flow of $661 million. We continue to manage our working capital metrics closely. DSO and number of days in inventory both remain relatively unchanged, even with our large top line growth. We ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet with a relatively small percentage of this amount offshore.
The next area I'd like to cover is share buybacks and also our warrant hedging coverage. In October, we purchased 1.3 million shares for $119 million under our special share authorization to complete our previously announced March 2015 call option hedging strategy. These were the only shares purchased in the quarter. We highlighted on our year-end call that we limit our regular share repurchases as a result of the additional borrowings to partially fund the PharMEDium acquisition.
As noted in our press release table and as we've said in the past, we are 100% hedged against the 2016 warrant exercise based on the ABC closing share price at December 31, 2015. This means we will not have an increase to our adjusted diluted share count when the warrant is exercised by Walgreens most likely in March 2016.
Now let's turn to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. I will provide guidance comments in a few key areas. Revenues. We continue to guide to ABC consolidated revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range for the full year, which included the new Publix account. 
Operating income, let me cover 3 items that are now impacting our full year operating income and margin.  First, generic inflation trends. Previously, our fiscal '16 guidance factored in moderating generic price appreciation. And consequently, for ABC, this translated to a lower dollar level of contribution versus fiscal '15. Now that we are starting our fifth month of our current fiscal year, we have had a longer period to evaluate generic pricing trends. We thought that we'd see some increased activity in January like we did last year, but it's still been especially slow. Based on this, our assumption around generic price appreciation has been updated. We now believe that generic inflation will be quite modest during the remaining 3 quarters of our fiscal year.
The second item, we are also forecasting that contributions from new generic drugs will be less than expected. This includes ALOXI, an infused oncology drug, and we previously expected to convert to generic. However, based on a recent court ruling, the generic launch has now been delayed a couple of years.
And the third item, as highlighted by Steve, we recently signed a new strategic long-term contract with CPA, an anchor customer to our independent retail segment. We made a proactive decision to renew roughly 1 year early so that we can start enhanced programs and initiatives with them to drive incremental business over the long term.
To summarize, due to the items that I covered above, our full year fiscal '16 operating income growth has slowed. As a result, we now expect that our operating margin will increase 3 to 5 basis points, down from the previous guidance of an increase of 8 to 12 basis points. Adjusted EPS. We now expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.73 to $5.83, which still reflects strong growth of 15% to 18% from last year's adjusted EPS. Free cash flow. Our guidance that we previously provided, $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, remains unchanged since we are still early in our fiscal year.
As I wrap up, I'd like to add that we did purchase approximately $100 million of stock under our regular share repurchase program in January. But a continued top priority for ABC is to reduce a portion of the debt associated with our recent acquisitions. However, as always, this is subject to reviewing our cash flow, market conditions and other competing capital needs.
So in summary, a solid quarter and start to the year. However, we will be working through the impact of 2 incremental headwinds this fiscal year that weren't previously expected, along with renewing an anchor customer to a unique 9-year contract. As always, we continue to drive efficiencies in our business while delivering value to all of our customers. We remain committed to growing our adjusted EPS in a meaningful way in fiscal '16 by focusing on what we do best, servicing our customers, deploying capital appropriately and making the right decisions to grow our business for the long run.
As always, we greatly appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

And then I guess, the second part would be I think it would be helpful to just level set for everyone why, if we are, in fact, returning to a more normalized deflationary environment. How does that not create a more significant drag on profitability?"

I think we -- of course, at recent conferences that we've discussed this a lot. I would say that ABC's approach as we're discerning -- we always knew we didn't have perfect information about generic price increases, and we did factor it in. Of course, we like to have -- strive for high performance, so it was something that we had to take into account. But we knew always that it was somewhat unpredictable. We don't have perfect information. So I would just say that ABC and our industry has proved to be very resilient, scrappy, we've gone through -- changed fee to service, the huge patent expirations that we've experienced in the past few years. We've had some specific events in specialty like oxaliplatin. And we've prospered in both inflationary and deflationary times. So our manufacturer contracts protect us on the downside for deflation. And the key to us is always increasing volume and to have the right scale. And that's where I think the WBAD alliance is so powerful. We entered into that before we started experiencing significant inflation because we felt by being global, we felt like really going into a partnership with the largest retailer was the right way to make sure that we always had competitive pricing on generics and a profitable environment, whatever we saw in the market. So I think we've made a lot of smart moves. And I will just say that we are confident we can make money in a deflationary environment and we have historically as well."

We've obviously seen a tightening of networks, et cetera, in independent pharmacy. And we've seen a real desire on ABC's account to expand the level of services that are what we call the next-generation of Good Neighbor Pharmacy services. So when you look at over 1,200 independent members that CPA has and you looked at our need for anchor customers, which we have that theme throughout ABC. We have it, for example, with Florida Cancer. We have it with, of course, WBA. We have it in dialysis with DaVita and Fresenius. So we have a lot of these just tremendous accounts. So we wanted to do really get CPA, to quote them, ""to unpack their bags"", to commit to us for the long term so we could work on the planning that is so vital to the strength and collaboration that we have with many key customers.

So we feel excited about the future. We have a lot of other levers that we continue to pull around operating excellence, more analysis, better long-term contracting with more information. We have expense efficiency that we continue to be very thoughtful about. And then, of course, that thoughtful capital deployment, which I think almost everyone would give us high marks on, whether it's the right dividend policy or the right share repurchases, the right internal investments which we make, many of which are so critical to our growth. We talked about one here in AmerisourceBergen Switzerland, but there's lots of examples of those really strategic internal investments we've made, which are probably among the best ROIC that we get on any investment. So I'd tell you we -- I'm excited about the future. I think we've got good prospects. And I would remind you that, again, we're talking about in 2016, 15% to 18% growth after 2 years of 20% plus.

And then secondly, just to understand some of the acquisitions that you've made recently, for example, like PharMEDium, and the impact that they can have because as we just think about the revision to the EBIT growth, right, or the margin expansion, I think we're just trying to work through the different impacts, how much that potentially is generic drug price inflation versus repricing and the benefit of some of these higher-margin businesses that you bought. So any incremental color around that, I think, would just really be helpful."

It's performing very well as is MWI. MWI, of course, is in a similar sort of industry from a competitive perspective as we are, where they have some very strong competitors that we compete against, but I think we are well positioned. I was at their sales meeting as I said on the call. So they're already performing at expectations and particularly have done well because of some economic circumstances. The companion animal business has actually done especially well. And again, we keep on adding new services there. 
PharMEDium, just really 2 months that we reported near closing in early November. We're happy. We made a few changes. We haven't had surprises. We, of course, are very mindful of the regulatory environment and trying to go to where the pack is going, make sure that we are ahead of regulators. But it's a business that we're thrilled to own. The response from customers has been good. But that said it's going to take long for there to be really any synergy on the business development side with PharMEDium and our health systems business. But it adds to the overall discussion level, it adds to our strategic relevance, so we like the acquisition. I will tell you that the growth profile in this business, especially the way that they can just do more business with their current customers than not. We are almost fully penetrated. We do all the needs for our health system customers on the prescription side, so this is a whole new way for them to grow as they keep on adding new therapies to their offerings as the customers get to like their service. So we are really pleased about that. 
Getting back to your question as far as the growth rate, you will see we've had a lot of investment because of WBA and the real -- the number of SKUs that we're distributing through our business has really increased significantly. And we've really caught up with that investment now. We would hope to continue investing in the network, making sure it's the most updated, efficient. And we do expect our toll customers to carry on growing. So the model is very leverageable, and I think you can look at the long history we have had of creating efficiencies. So I would say it's leverageable. We've just had some occurrences here with not having a strong generic launch period in this quarter and probably the March quarter, and also the inflation that we talked about as well as some tough comps on the DoD and the renewal on CPA, which I could tell you we've done for all the right reasons. So that -- Tim has something to add."

And secondly, I just want to go back to your tax question, just to confirm. When we gave new guidance on our revised tax rate, that's clearly not related to the IRS private letter ruling. That's -- the change in our tax rate is related to international mix, being very planful and thoughtful about growing international business, seeing the tax rate come down because of that, and also we're implementing a formal R&D tax credit program related to technology. So those are the drivers of the adjusted tax rate, not the IRS private letter ruling, I just want to confirm that."

So we don't see anything that's really in a historical context irrational or truly surprising. Again, we just -- we don't have perfect information on that.

But we had an opportunity, and I had a great meeting with their board, along with our senior drug and independent pharmacy. I was really encouraged by their willingness to commit to us. And you think about 9 years from now to think about signing a contract for all their members. And one of their board members was very emotional almost a bit and talked about the responsibility they have to their patients, to their employees, to the different members. And it is kind of a voluntary group that they get together for various reasons. And the fact that they were willing to commit to ABC, we took as a good sign. So we went ahead and there wasn't a formal RFP process. And that's actually how a lot of our industry works. Customers like staying with their current wholesaler in most cases. And absent some change in ownership or that, a lot of our customers do tend to stay with us even though it's a very competitive environment. So we also are excited with the new Elevate program that Dave Neu is working hard on, on adding different elements to that. Our PSAO network and the new contracting that we have with many networks to get CPA really embedded in that is very important to our whole Good Neighbor Pharmacy offering, including to the other Good Neighbor Pharmacy members, the strength of their program is having a robust membership and it's for us -- sorry, at really high level of services and a high level of efficiency on the purchasing side. So that was part of that decision there so."

I think that one of the best ways I can answer this is referring back to my comments on WBAD and the global scale and sourcing that we have, and the fact that we did this in 2013 and it was one of the key drivers for our Forest agreement and the equity and the warrants and the board seats that we gave to WBA. And at that stage, it was 2 separate companies. Of course, now they've come together. So that was a key driver. And the contracting process is really -- it's not necessarily that you've seen one and you've seen them all. We've tried to have a fairly wide sourcing philosophy, and that's true both at ABC and at WBAD. So we think we're very well positioned, and that puts our customers in a good position and it puts our relationship with the suppliers in a good position. So we feel like we can be successful in any generic environment. And the agreements with generic manufacturers are more market share-based. They're more performance-based as opposed to the IMAs on the branded side. I would just characterize it as that."

Let me start by saying that while we delivered solid performance in our March quarter, we are disappointed that the forecast we have presented for the second half of our fiscal 2015 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 fall below our historical rates of performance. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our industry and our company, and we are well-positioned with the right customers and the right portfolio of services for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers should drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Certain areas of our business are performing very well, including both of our recent acquisitions, MWI, veterinary supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group, including the distribution businesses that serve our positions and our consulting businesses had a very strong March quarter. In addition, we recently achieved 2 key customer renewals or extension for AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, including a 3-year extension with our strategic long-term partner, Walgreens-Boots Alliance, and a 1-year extension with Express Scripts, our second-largest customer. ABDC is however being adversely impacted by several factors, including accelerating deflation on generic drugs and a lower contribution from generic launches. These unanticipated trends have exasperated the expected impact from a shift in product mix towards lower margin and higher priced specialty and branded drugs, as well as the lack of generic inflation we discussed in our Q1 call. As we work through these challenges, our overall earnings growth rate will slow somewhat. Tim will discuss the March quarter results and walk through our detailed guidance for the second half of fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017. Then I will outline the ways we intend to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that are in front of us before we open the call to Q&A. 
Now, here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year unless otherwise noted. Also, let me point out that after this quarter, we fully anniversary the impact of adding MWI to our consolidated financial results. My comments will be a little lengthier this morning as I have a fair amount to cover in 3 primary areas. First, I will recap our fiscal Q2 consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations; and third, I will provide a brief commentary on how we are thinking about fiscal '17. Even though it's early, we will provide initial thoughts in a few key areas. 
With that, we can begin our fiscal Q2 review. Revenues were $35.7 billion, up 9.3%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continue to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. Our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium combined ACcounted for roughly 2% of our consolidated revenue growth. The quarter adjusted gross profit increased 12% [ph]  to $1.2 billion. The dollar growth was due to our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, specifically the Drug Company, was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. They continue to experience headwinds from contract renewals and lower generic inflation. 
Operating expenses, our total adjusted OpEx increased 18% to $575 million. Roughly 80% of the increase was related to our 2 acquisitions. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these 2 companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been about 4%. As you have come to expect from ABC, we are prudent with expense spending. This has always been one of ABC's core operating practices, and it will remain so going forward. Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $592 million, up about $40 million or 7%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.66%, down 3 basis points from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 8 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $31 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing costs of the MWI and PharMEDium acquisitions. Income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 31.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. This quarter's rate includes a one-time rate benefit of 1.4% from adjusting our estimated year-to-date cash rate, specifically related to the expansion of our international operation, which are passed at a lower rate. We now expect our full year cash rate to be approximately 33%. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $1.68, driven mostly by the income from our 2 recent acquisitions and to a lesser degree, from our lower consolidated tax rate. Our adjusted diluted share count was about 229 million shares, down some from last year. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $34.2 billion, up nearly 8%. Our Drug Company had a growth rate of about 6%. This growth was net of revenue headwind of about 2% due to lower hepatitis C sales in the market and also a transfer of certain oncology sales to our specialty business. Drug Company has solid growth across this chain customers, including Walgreens and also in our Hospital segment. Our Specialty Business group had another outstanding quarter, with revenue increasing about 18% driven mostly by volume growth. Similar to last quarter, we continue to have meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across a few of our businesses and also from the sale of ophthalmology drugs and our [indiscernible] medical business. [indiscernible] our third party logistics business accounted for roughly 20% of specialty revenue growth, primarily due to a new manufacturer relationship they had late last year. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our Specialty Group. We continue to be very pleased with their performance. It clearly helped to differentiate ABC from the rest of the market. 
Moving to gross profit, the segment's gross profit was $882 million, up about $33 million or about 4%. The majority of the growth in gross profit dollars was in our growth company, specifically the benefit from PharMEDium. Excluding the acquisition benefit, Drug Company was behind last year's gross profit due to the headwinds I called out previously. The tough comparison on drug price inflation and contract renewals. Segment operating income was $498 million and was up 2%. Our Specialty business continued with their high level of performance, offset by the lower performance of our Drug Company.  Before I finish up the segment, let me comment this was our first full quarter of reporting PharMEDium. Financially, they are contributing better than we expected as a result of strong operational performance. For the quarter, volume growth as a percentage was in the mid-teens. The business has integrated especially well into the Drug Company. We are off to a great start with PharMEDium. 
We can now move to our Other segment which includes MWI Consulting Services and World Courier. In the March quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. As a reminder, our March 2015 quarterly results included about 5 weeks of MWI's operating results. Growth in just Consulting and World Courier combined was about 13%. These businesses continue to grow their top line revenue primarily as a result of providing additional services and growing volumes with existing customers, which is a clear indicator of customer satisfaction and value. MWI continues to perform especially well. Percentage revenue growth in the Companion Animal segment in the low teens, and we saw a nice recovery in the Production Animal segment with percentage revenue growth in the high single digits. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $94 million. MWI contributed a significant amount of the dollar increase. Our consulting business also had excellent income growth in the quarter.  The segment's operating margin was down about 60 basis points. This is the result of MWI becoming a much larger percentage of the result and having a lower margin in comparison to the 2 other businesses within the other segment. During the March quarter, we saw the one year anniversary of acquiring our MWI, we want to thank Jim Cleary [ph] and the entire MWI team for an outstanding first year. We continue to be impressed with the passion and knowledge their associates demonstrate everyday, partnering with our customers and the manufacturers. And, importantly, the MWI's business outperformed our first year financial expectation. They are on strong footing and on track to deliver long-term returns we anticipated. 
I want to switch over now and cover a few key working capital and cash flow items. In the March quarter, we had solid free cash flow of $790 million. This quarter historically has been our strongest cash quarter of the year as we cycle through the seasonal inventory build through calendar year end. At March 31, we have roughly $2.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes roughly $400 million offshore related primarily to our World Courier and Switzerland businesses. During the quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization. As noted in this morning's press release, we announced that our board authorized a new regular share repurchase program that together with the availability under the existing share program the purchase of the $750 million of our shares. Also back in mid-March, we filed an 8-K announcing that Walgreens exercised their 2016 stock warrant through our hedging program. As we committed, we successfully offset the EPS diluted impact from the 23 million shares issued to Walgreens. In conjunction with its hedging program, the company through the investment bank, executed call options to purchase ABC shares. The finding of the call option transaction was not entirely completed in the March quarter. We take $218 million to the investment bank in the March quarter and the remaining amount $483 million was paid to the bank in April. 
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations, I must acknowledge that revising our adjusted EPS guidance downwards a second time is very disappointing to us. Adverse market trends centered around generic pricing have become more acute than we anticipated, and the strategic initiative to offset some of these pressures has not yet yielded results we expected. While generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of generic drug deflation is slowly increasing, and is higher than the level we previously expected in fiscal year 2016 and expected to get slightly worse by year-end. This is driven in part by the increased supply of generic products in the channel. While we are protected from inventory losses on deflationary products, it is difficult to continue to earn the same gross profit dollars on decreasing prices. We have had some success in being made whole through incentives, rebates, providing increasing in generic volumes but we are not always 100% successful in achieving this. Combined with this, our growth profit contributions from new generic launches are decreasing as brand manufacturers increasingly find ways to protect and retain market share. Additionally, after several years of a favorable branded generic revenue mix in our Drug Company's business, this trend is starting to reverse. As more lower margin branded specially drugs shift primarily to hospitals and specialty pharmacies through full line distribution in our Drug Company, these revenues do not currently provide enough gross profit dollars to overcome the decline in generic drug gross profit. 
With regard to our strategic initiative, our Drug Company about [ph] a year ago set forth on a strategic initiative to grow its independent retail business, and in conjunction with this, grow ProGenerics business. The business under new management had additional resources made investments in innovative programs and aligned internal incentives. We expect to see meaningful progress in our June to September 2016 quarters from these investments and efforts. While we are making progress, the financial contribution is ramping slower than anticipated. Based on the 2 headwinds that I covered, M&A has an impact from previously disclosed contract renewals. The Drug Company's fiscal '16 operating income will be lower on a year-over-year basis, even with PharMEDium included. 
Our revised fiscal '16 P&L guidance is as follows: Revenues below guiding the ABC consolidated revenue growth are approximately 8% for the full fiscal year. Operating income, we expect growth in consolidated operating income to be in the range of 5% to 6%. As a result of the lower expected half expectations and lower-than-expected performance of our Drug Company. Included in this growth is the benefit from measures we plan to take to reduce our expense structure going forward. Adjusted EPS, we now expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.44 and $5.54 which is growth of 10% to 12%. As I just highlighted, our EPS range includes the benefit of several cents from expense reductions we will be implementing in the second half of the fiscal year. 
I'd like to now cover our revised guidance on free cash flow and also share repurchases. This morning, we issued a separate press release announcing our contract amendment with our largest customer Walgreens. As we disclosed, we have entered into a 3-year contract extension with our anchor partner through both the distribution agreement and the generic sourcing agreement. In the past, we have disclosed that this customer accounted for about 30% of our consolidated revenues. In our view, there are a few customers that have both the scale and growth profile like Walgreens. The relationship is on its fourth year has exceeded our initial financial projection and has provided an excellent return to our shareholders. In exchange for the extensions, we agreed to have additional capital and infrastructure investment during the next several months and also into fiscal '17. Some of these investments including carrying extra inventory to maximize service levels have recently started. Because of these working capital investments, we are now revising our free cash flow guidance to $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year. And this now includes the tax benefit from the 2016 warrant exercise. 
For share repurchases, using a portion of the cash from the warrant exercise, we expect to increase our repurchases, which will now total between $350 million and $450 million. As always, share repurchases are subject to change, depending on market conditions, our second half of the year cash position and other competing capital needs. 
The third and final topic I want to cover this morning is commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Since we changed our assumptions around the second half of fiscal '16, we thought it was important to provide a preliminary look at next year, fiscal '17. Revenues, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to be slightly better than market. Operating income, the headwinds that I called out to relating to the second half of fiscal '16 will continue and grow into fiscal '17. Also, we do expect to have headwinds from both the Kaiser and TK contract renewals for half of the fiscal year. Consequently, our Drug Company's operating income is expected to be up just slightly, and this includes solid growth from PharMEDium. Adjusted EPS growth, we expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the midpoint of our revised fiscal '15 guidance range. I should highlight that the 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth is net of a 3% headwind from the incremental expenses to support key business investments and IT systems and infrastructure. These investments support our growth like customer satisfaction and further increase our operating efficiency. We expect to realize meaningful expense savings from these incremental investment of at least $30 million, annually beginning in fiscal '19. 
The preliminary view of our fiscal '17 outlook includes several key assumptions as follows: One, we are expecting generic drug deflation to be in the high single digits by fiscal year end '16, and, more importantly, we are forecasting that generic drug deflation will stay in this range for the entire fiscal '17; two, our tax rate will be slightly lower in fiscal '17; three, we have limited capital deployment in our adjusted EPS range. We plan to complete enough share repurchases to offset stock-option exercises; four, that we retain Kaiser, an important customer in the Drug Company; five, we are not including any new business resulting from our relationship with our largest customer; six, we have not included any impact from the proposed CMS Medicare Part B reimbursement proposal as it's too early to ascertain the likelihood that this would be successfully implemented; and seven, we are not assuming a meaningful contribution from biosimilars. 
Moving to free cash flow preliminary guidance and cash availability, as I mentioned earlier, we have agreed to make working capital investments as a result of the Walgreens contract amendment. The working capital impact is greater in fiscal '17 than fiscal '16. Also, the impact primarily affects the first half of our fiscal '17. We anticipate that our capital spend will increase as we invest in our drug distribution network due to age of the network and also to increase capacity. Additionally, we are making key IT platform investments in our Consulting and World Courier businesses. Both have older systems, both have older systems that are inefficient and costly. As a result of these investments, we expect that our free cash flow in fiscal '17 will be approximately equal to or just slightly below our adjusted net income. An important point. Once we cycle through the impact through the Walgreens working capital investment and the higher CapEx in fiscal '17, our aspirational goal in fiscal '18 and beyond would be to have free cash flow of at least 125% of net income each year. Assuming over time, we maintain our current terms of customers and suppliers. From a cash availability standpoint, I should mention that we expect our offshore cash to continue to increase in fiscal '17 as a result of our international businesses. 
The final item I will cover is the future exercise of the 2017 warrants. Because of our hedging strategy, we are fully covered from any potential adjusted EPS dilution when our share price is $88 or lower. We will certainly monitor this as we progress towards the exercise window which is March 2017 to September 2017. As a reminder, roughly 60% of the warrant proceeds will be used to exercise our cat call options with the investment bank and purchase shares needed to successfully complete the hedge. The remaining proceeds are expected to be used to repay the 2017 bond that we originally issued in connection with the hedging program. 
As I close my comments, we are on a different trajectory for the remainder of fiscal '16 and also for fiscal '17 than we had originally anticipated. However, we are well-positioned to navigate through a challenging environment, drive efficiency and thoughtfully deploy capital in a manner that drives long-term shareholder value. 
Now, I will turn it back to Steve"

As we look ahead to the second half of our fiscal year and into next year, there is no doubt that we have some challenging work ahead as we navigate the headwinds that Tim outlined. But I am certain that we have the right team in place, not only to meet this near-term challenge, but also to ensure that we do not lose sight of the many long-term opportunity that are ahead of us. 
Let's look at each of the foundational pieces of our business more closely. We are very fortunate to be heavily weighted to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, with organic market growth rate is expected to be 7% to 8% over the next several years. This is extremely significant benefit that our industry enjoys and all U.S. wholesalers are beneficiaries of this market growth, especially to the extent that it is being driven by demographics and improving access to care. Market growth to the U.S. is also driven by new brand product introductions, both in more traditional therapy and in innovative specialty products and to a lesser extent by branded drug inflation. Of course, going forward, there will be less erosion at the top line from new generic launches. The large U.S. wholesalers together comprise the most efficient distribution network in the world and provide tremendous value to the pharmaceutical supply channel. AmerisourceBergen has distinguished itself within this accomplished group with its portfolio of services with specialty and biotech manufacturers and for the healthcare providers that administer these innovative products. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. The economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel on which the product is administered or dispensed. Whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefits and to the extent which we could add value to the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by physicians who is treating the patients in a community setting because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
While the prices of some of these specialty drugs get a lot of attention, we should not lose sight of the fact that these products treat extremely serious illnesses. In many cases, our life-saving products were life-changing drugs that make a previously intractable disease manageable. White we certainly understand the need to manage the cost of care, the physicians and other healthcare providers who treat the sickest patients should not themselves be economically harmed simply by choosing the best available therapy for their patient. 
As someone who has been working around community physicians including oncologists for over 20 years, I want to comment specifically on CMS' proposed demonstration project on Part B drugs. There is little evidence, if any, that physicians are systematically and inappropriately prescribing expensive therapy. The proposal ignores the reimbursement challenges physicians already face on many Part B medications, such as those that remain in place as a result of sequestration. The cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and unintended consequences of further reductions should be carefully studied because it is the patient that will bear the ultimate burden both in terms of the economic and in terms of the quality of the lives. We are hopeful that the issues at the proposal would be addressed and it will not be implemented in its current form. 
Turning back to our business, portfolio of services -- the portfolio of services we offer applies broadly to potentially all pharmaceuticals, and going forward, we will move to a pricing model that is more balanced between generic and brand products. Today, the basic logistics of warehousing and distributing the products is the bedrock of what we do, and additional services we provide have greatly differentiated our place in the market. We can meet the needs of pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers as virtually every point that drives life cycle from the clinical trial phase through commercialization of the brand and into the patient and product support for mature therapy and eventually through the launch of generic or biosimilar versions of products. The portfolio of offerings we have bought [ph] over the last decade will be even more important in the market that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency. Some organic market growth and the right portfolio of services are critical components of increasing revenues. But you put [indiscernible] we need to be alive at the right customers, and this is another area where I believe we excel. AmerisourceBergen has an unparalleled throughput marquee customers with whom we have established long-term relationship. As both Tim and I mentioned earlier, we are thrilled to extend our innovative and highly successful partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance, and we look forward to continuing to reap the mutual benefits of this unique and collaborative relationship well beyond the original 10-year term. This relationship has greatly benefited both parties and has financially exceeded our expectations. I am also pleased that Express Scripts has decided to exercise their option to extend their current contract for an additional year. We've been working with this market leading pharmacy benefit manager for the last 4 years, and we continue to look for new ways we can partner together to drive value for the long term. We now have several of our largest customers in each of our key segments under long-term contract, and we hope  that we'll soon be able to say the same about Kaiser Permanente. Over many years, we have deliberately chosen specific customers whom we believe will be on the cutting-edge of pharmaceutical care, and therefore, grow faster than the market over the long run. 
In addition to the 3 customers already mentioned, we renewed our largest independent GPO customer, CPA, during the quarter, and of course, we have our largest government contract, the Department of Defense, also on our long-term contract. This strategy has already paid dividends and will continue to do so for many years to come. Our focus on high quality customers is not limited to just the very largest in the marketplace. We have extensive relationships with prudent drug retailers, institutions and other top health care providers of various shapes and sizes and have long been champions of both independent community pharmacy and have specialty physicians in community practice. For example, we will continue to make investments to make that we meet specific site of care needs as well as to serve providers who integrate offerings across different channel, and I think the AmerisourceBergen is the best-positioned in the market to deliver meaningful innovation in these areas. Another key customer group is, of course, our pharmaceutical manufacture partner. Our extensive array of manufacture services businesses are another meaningful differentiator for ABC, and these businesses are and will continue to be the fastest growing in the company. Whether we are working on clinical logistics in World Courier, working on rumors meant and commercialization in our consulting business while supporting patient assistance program both around some of the more complex therapies, I believe the suite of services will only become more valuable in the future. As manufacturers must demonstrate value and comparative effectiveness and patient adherence becomes more essential and less exceptional and complex biosimilars are launched at the marketplace, AmerisourceBergen will be the partner of choice. Certain customers while today's market and we will not continue to do so in the most efficient manner possible. While our expenses have increased in recent years and will continue to rise somewhat as we integrate our recent acquisitions and make some additional investments in our information-technology systems and other infrastructure, I want to assure you that we remain focused on being the most efficient operator in the industry. 
As cost pressures increase across the board in health care, it is even more important that we manage our own with an increasingly high degree of precision than we've done historically. We have always skillfully ran lean operations. This is an area where we need to apply even greater creativity and sensitivity to what needs to be done to meet the needs of the customers in a way we can strip out undefined productive expenses. This is a process that never ends and it is important to remember that investments we are making today will ultimately lower the cost of doing business in the future. 
As we grow our revenues, efficiently run our operation and through it all working capital investment that Tim discussed, we expect to be able to generate strong cash flow over the long term. This has long been the hallmark of our business and this one of the key ways in which we have driven shareholder value. We remain committed to be excellent stewards of capital, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to have a balanced approach to deploying our cash going forward. 
Our track record in this area is very strong. We have had successful internal projects like Bluepoint, the NDC, National Distribution Center, and more recently, Certio. In addition, we have made very successful strategic investments in 3 market leaders: World Courier, MWI Animal Health, formerly veterinary supply, and PharMEDium. These 3 large acquisitions have strengthened our business in key areas, and all of them have exceeded our expectations in terms of the operational and financial and performance and have yielded important strategic benefits. Looking ahead, we will continue to look for high-quality access to the pharmaceutical channel that have great potential to deliver long-term value. In addition, of course, we will continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the near term, we remain committed to offsetting the potential dilution from the excise of the 2017 warrant, and over the longer term, we will be thoughtful and resourceful with our capital deployment as we have always been since inception of AmerisourceBergen. 
In summary, while we are disappointed in our near-term forecast, our hope as all of our shareholders share my great conviction and confidence in AmerisourceBergen franchise. Our management team, our portfolio offerings and our collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger. As I've said on many locations, while we focus on delivering short-term results, we offset with deliver long-term performance that reflects ABC's excellent position, thought leadership and customer focus. Ultimately, it is our daily patient through continuous improvement the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution, our financial performance and our goal to capital management that would help us ensure we would generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come. 
Now I will turn it over to Barbara to dig in Q&A."

We're talking now specifically about the Drug Company, it is obviously a bit different specialty business and different than a veterinary or PharMEDium business. But what we tried to accomplish in the long-term is a bit of balancing contributions between brand, generic and specialty therapies, which will include biosimilars and precision medicine and products and cell-based therapies. So all of these new innovative products we expect to get a fair return on, and that's a discussion we're having with our customers and definitely the discussions we're having with our manufacturers as well. Now the reality is that the sales site tends to catch up with the buy-side and by sell side we mean contracts that we have with providers. So we've seen some very rapid changes in the marketplace that's probably we believe growth in the industry will be driven by -- more by innovation than by installation on established products even if they are not subject to generic competition.

We think it is a mix of customer base we have including being with some of the best [indiscernible] like WBA and is part of the specialty marketing, including we do have a lot of specialty business in our core drug wholesale business. We do expect revenue to grow above slightly the market. And then because we have a strong association or waiting towards those large customers and because of the mixes that we see, we don't expect to be able to keep our gross profit growth with the revenue growth. But we do expect that we're going to have operating leverage because there are several investments that we're making. So we won't be scaled coming from that. And we are moving ahead rapidly with integrating MWI and PharMEDium which is really severely impacted our expense rate. Another good benefit that we have is on improving tax rate, and then I think ABC has excellent capital deployments not only on acquisitions but on buying shares back at the right time. And this is my 20th quarter, and I think when I did my first quarter, we were in the mid to high 30s have done very, very well with that. The one thing I'm very proud of them, we talked about a quarter about Certio and our national back, these projects, BluePoint, these projects have really been outstanding and as you know again depending on what happens in the market and how cash flow progresses, we're all forecasting in the long run 125%. That's quite implicit in Tim's comments. So we would have opportunities, certainly stock prices as we [indiscernible] terms. So this would be the drivers for our long-term growth model."

I think people understand this it's well, well-understood as to how the industry is changing. It just makes sense because the price of these products and the value they represent is very different than traditional oral solid brand medication, and also they apply to smaller patient population and this complex requirements, complex reimbursement. So AmerisourceBergen has been doing this for a long time. So recently in a strategic review for Specialty Group, they made a very interesting observation that I think is pertinent, it's really that the specialty business has become the brand business and the future specialty businesses will be orphan drugs, biosimilars, precision medicine, cell based therapy. I think that's where AmerisourceBergen will still excel and differentiate ourselves. But Bob Marsh and his team, as I said earlier, wants paving [ph] on our GSM side, and our global supply chain side, are really focused on talking to manufacturers about constraint, making sure we get fair reimbursement and we need to talk to -- we are talking not only to the Walgreens and Express Scripts but we have a big specialty pharmacy customer base, we have ultimate care customer base, we have a big health system and hospital GPO hospital-based and all of the customers need to remove a long and as we get through the contracting phase, it is our strong intention that we will make a profit on specialty drugs and innovative therapy whatever the size of care is."

Now it's interesting because as can imagine, we dug very deep into this and our unit sales are not all that much. It really is the generic deflation and the lower average selling price of the amount of generics, but we're not forcing out any generic sales and the pricing that and the weighting implies to be as high as anticipated, honestly until February. And that's about 1/3 of this along with what we've seen in the last quarter and the next 2 quarters, which is the generic efficiency rate that we're experiencing as a wholesaler. It doesn't mean that the market's not being as inefficient, just means we're just seeing that 50% conversion. So we definitely lost a couple of percent of anticipated earnings from generic launches.

I would say that's a big part of the reset, and then we also called out our plan to grow our independent generics. Those are the 2 reasons for the reset. We put them in that order. The environmental first, carrying more weight. So I would say it's easily 2/3, 1/3."

Let me start by saying that while we delivered solid performance in our March quarter, we are disappointed that the forecast we have presented for the second half of our fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 fall below our historical rates of performance. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our industry and our company, and we are well positioned with the right customers and the right portfolio of services for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers should drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Certain areas of our business are performing very well, including both of our recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our specialty group, including the distribution businesses that service -- that serve physicians and our consulting businesses had a very strong March quarter. In addition, we recently achieved 2 key customer renewals or extensions in AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, including a 3-year extension with our strategic long-term partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance; and a 1-year extension with Express Scripts, our second-largest customer. 
ABDC is however being adversely impacted by several factors, including accelerating deflation on generic drugs and a lower contribution from generic launches. These unanticipated trends have exasperated the expected impact from a shift in product mix towards lower margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs as well as the lack of generic inflation we discussed in our Q1 call. As we work through these challenges, our overall earnings growth rate will slow somewhat. Tim will discuss the March quarter results and walk through our detailed guidance for the second half of fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017. Then I will outline the ways we intend to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that are in front of us before we open the call to Q&A. 
Now here is Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same quarter",2886,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. Also, let me point out that after this quarter, we fully anniversary the impact of adding MWI to our consolidated financial results. My comments will be a little lengthier this morning as I have a fair amount to cover in 3 primary areas. First, I will recap our fiscal Q2 consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations; and third, I will provide a brief commentary on how we are thinking about fiscal '17. Even though it's early, we will provide initial thoughts in a few key areas. 
With that, we can begin our fiscal Q2 review. Revenues were $35.7 billion, up 9.3%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continued to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. Our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium, combined, accounted for roughly 2% of our consolidated revenue growth. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 12% to $1.2 billion. The dollar growth was due to our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, specifically the drug company, was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. They continue to experience headwinds from contract renewals and lower generic inflation. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 18% to $575 million. Roughly 80% of the increase was related to our 2 acquisitions. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these 2 companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been about 4%. As you have come to expect from ABC, we are prudent with expense spending. This has always been one of ABC's core operating practices, and it will remain so going forward. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $592 million, up about $40 million or 7%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.66%, down 3 basis points from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 8 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $31 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing costs of the MWI and PharMEDium acquisitions. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. This quarter's rate includes the onetime rate benefit of 1.4% from adjusting our estimated year-to-date cash rate, specifically related to the expansion of our international operations which are taxed at a lower rate. We now expect our full year cash rate to be approximately 33%. 
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $1.68, driven mostly by the income from our 2 recent acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, from our lower consolidated tax rate. 
Our adjusted diluted share count was about 229 million shares, down some from last year. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $34.2 billion, up nearly 8%. Our drug company had a growth rate of about 6%. This growth was net of revenue headwind of about 2% due to lower hepatitis C sales in the market and also a transfer of certain oncology sales to our specialty business. Drug company had solid growth across its chain customers, including Walgreens and also in our hospital segment. Our specialty business group had another outstanding quarter with revenue increasing about 18%, driven mostly by volume growth. Similar to last quarter, we continue to have meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across a few of our businesses and also from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business. 
ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for roughly 28% of specialty revenue growth, primarily due to a new manufacturer relationship they added late last year. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our specialty group. We continue to be very pleased with their performance. It clearly helped to differentiate ABC from the rest of the market. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $882 million, up about $33 million or about 4%. The majority of the growth in gross profit dollars was in our drug company, specifically the benefit from PharMEDium. Excluding the acquisition benefit, drug company was behind last year's gross profit due to the headwinds I called out previously, the tough comparison on drug price inflation and contract renewals. 
Segment operating income was $498 million and was up 2%. Our specialty business continued with their high level of performance, offset by the lower performance of our drug company. 
Before I finish up the segment, let me comment this was our first full quarter of reporting PharMEDium. Financially, they are contributing better than we expected as a result of strong operational performance. For the quarter, volume growth as a percentage was in the mid-teens. The business have integrated especially well into the drug company. We are off to a great start with PharMEDium. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI, Consulting Services and World Courier. In the March quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. As a reminder, our March 2015 quarterly results included about 5 weeks of MWI's operating results. Growth in just Consulting and World Courier combined was about 13%. These businesses continue to grow their top line revenue, primarily as a result of providing additional services and growing volumes with existing customers, which is a clear indicator of customer satisfaction and value. 
MWI continues to perform especially well. Percentage revenue growth for -- in the companion animal segment in the low teens, and we saw a nice recovery in the production animal segment with percentage revenue growth in the high single digits. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $94 million. MWI contributed a significant amount of the dollar increase. Our consulting business also had excellent income growth in the quarter.  
The segment's operating margin was down about 60 basis points. This is the result of MWI becoming a much larger percentage of the result and having a lower margin in comparison to the 2 other businesses within the Other segment. 
During the March quarter, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of acquiring MWI. We want to thank Jim Cleary and the entire MWI team for an outstanding first year. We continue to be impressed with the passion and knowledge their associates demonstrate every day, partnering with our customers and the manufacturers. And importantly, the MWI's business has outperformed our first year financial expectation. They are on strong footing and on track to deliver long-term returns we anticipated. 
I'd like to switch over now and cover a few key working capital and cash flow items. In the March quarter, we had solid free cash flow of $790 million. This quarter historically has been our strongest cash quarter of the year as we cycle through the seasonal inventory build from calendar year-end. At March 31, we have roughly $2.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes roughly $400 million offshore, related primarily to our World Courier and Switzerland businesses. 
During the quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization. As noted in this morning's press release, we announced that our board authorized a new regular share repurchase program that together with the availability under the existing share program permits us to purchase up to $750 million of our shares. 
Also back in mid-March, we filed an 8-K, announcing that Walgreens exercised their 2016 stock warrant through our hedging program. As we committed, we successfully offset the EPS diluted impact from the 23 million shares issued to Walgreens. In conjunction with its hedging program, the company through an investment bank executed call options to purchase ABC shares. The funding of the call option transaction was not entirely completed in the March quarter. We paid $218 million to the investment bank in the March quarter, and the remaining amount of $483 million was paid to the bank in April. 
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. I must acknowledge that revising our adjusted EPS guidance downward a second time is very disappointing to us. Adverse market trends, centered around generic pricing, have been -- have become more acute than we anticipated, and a strategic initiative to offset some of these pressures has not yet yielded the results we expected. While generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of generic drug deflation is slowly increasing and is higher than the level we previously expected in fiscal '16 and expected to get slightly worse by year-end. This is driven in part by the increased supply of generic products in the channel. While we are protected from inventory losses on deflationary products, it's difficult to continue to earn the same gross profit dollars on decreasing prices. We have had some success in being made whole through new incentives or rebates or by increasing generic sales volumes, but we are not always 100% successful in achieving this. Combined with this, our growth profit contributions from new generic launches are decreasing as brand manufacturers increasingly find ways to protect and retain market share. 
Additionally, after several years of a favorable branded generic revenue mix in our drug company business, this trend is starting to reverse. As more lower-margin branded specialty drugs shift primarily to hospitals and specialty pharmacies through full-line distribution in our drug company, these revenues do not currently provide enough gross profit dollars to overcome the decline in generic drug gross profit. 
With regard to our strategic initiative, our drug company about a year ago set forth on a strategic initiative to grow its independent retail business, and in conjunction with this, grow ProGenerics revenues. The business added new management and additional resources, made investments in innovative programs and aligned internal incentives. We expected to see meaningful progress in our June and September '16 quarters from these investments and efforts. 
While we are making progress, the financial contribution is ramping slower than anticipated. Based on the 2 headwinds that I covered and the negative impact from previously disclosed contract renewals, the drug company's fiscal '16 operating income will be lower on a year-over-year basis, even with PharMEDium included. 
Our revised fiscal '16 P&L guidance is as follows: revenues, we are now guiding the ABC consolidated revenue growth of approximately 8% for the full fiscal year; operating income, we expect growth in consolidated operating income to be in the range of 5% to 6% as a result of the lower second half expectations and lower-than-expected performance of our drug company. Included in this growth is a benefit from measures we plan to take to reduce our expense structure going forward. Adjusted EPS, we now expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.44 and $5.54, which is growth of 10% to 12%. As I just highlighted, our EPS range includes the benefit of several cents [ph] from expense reductions we will be implementing in the second half of the fiscal year. 
I'd like to now cover our revised guidance on free cash flow and also share repurchases. This morning, we issued a separate press release announcing our contract amendment with our largest customer, Walgreens. As we disclosed, we have entered into a 3-year contract extension with our anchor partner through both the distribution agreement and the generic sourcing agreement. In the past, we have disclosed that this customer accounted for about 30% of our consolidated revenues. 
In our view, there are a few customers that have both the scale and growth profile like Walgreens. The relationship, now on its fourth year, has exceeded our initial financial projections and has provided an excellent return to our shareholders. In exchange for the extensions, we agreed to make additional working capital and infrastructure investments during the next several months and also into fiscal '17. Some of these investments, including carrying extra inventory to maximize service levels, have recently started. Because of these working capital investments, we are now revising our free cash flow guidance to $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year. And this now includes the tax benefit from the 2016 warrant exercise. 
For share repurchases, using a portion of the cash from the warrant exercise, we expect to increase our repurchases, which will now total between $350 million and $450 million. As always, share repurchases are subject to change, depending on market conditions, our second half of the year cash position and other competing capital needs. 
The third and final topic I want to cover this morning is commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Since we changed our assumptions around the second half of fiscal '16, we thought it was important to provide a preliminary look at next year, fiscal '17. Revenues, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to be slightly better than market; operating income, the headwinds that I called out related to the second half of fiscal '16 will continue well into fiscal '17. Also, we do expect to have headwinds from both the Kaiser and CPA contract renewals for half of the fiscal year. Consequently, our drug company's operating income expected -- is expected to be up just slightly, and this includes solid growth from PharMEDium. Adjusted EPS growth, we expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the midpoint of our revised fiscal '16 guidance range. I should highlight that the 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth is net of a 3% headwind from the incremental expenses to support key business investments in IT systems and infrastructure. These investments support our growth, drive customer satisfaction and further increase our operating efficiency. We expect to realize meaningful expense savings from these incremental investments of at least $30 million annually beginning in fiscal '19. 
The preliminary view of our fiscal '17 outlook includes several key assumptions as follows: one, we are expecting generic drug deflation to be in the high single digits by fiscal year end '16, and more importantly, we are forecasting that generic drug deflation will stay in this range for the entire fiscal '17; two, our tax rate will be slightly lower in fiscal '17; three, we have limited capital deployment in our adjusted EPS range. We plan to complete enough share repurchases to offset stock option exercises; four, that we retain Kaiser, an important customer of the drug company; five, we are not including any new business, resulting from our relationship with our largest customer; six, we have not included any impact from the proposed CMS Medicare Part B reimbursement proposal as it's too early to ascertain the likelihood that this will be successfully implemented; and seven, we are not assuming a meaningful contribution from biosimilars. 
Moving to free cash flow preliminary guidance and cash availability. As I mentioned earlier, we have agreed to make working capital investments as a result of the Walgreens contract amendment. The working capital impact is greater in fiscal '17 than fiscal '16. Also, the impact primarily affects the first half of our fiscal '17. We anticipate that our capital spend will increase as we invest in our drug distribution network due to age of the network and also to increase capacity. Additionally, we are making key IT platform investments in our Consulting and World Courier businesses. Both have older systems that are inefficient and costly. As a result of these investments, we expect that our free cash flow in fiscal '17 will be approximately equal to or just slightly below our adjusted net income. 
An important point, once we cycle through the impacts from the Walgreens working capital investment and the higher CapEx in fiscal '17, our aspirational goal in fiscal '18 and beyond would be to have free cash flow of at least 125% of net income each year, assuming over time we maintain our current terms of customers and suppliers. From a cash availability standpoint, I should mention that we expect our offshore cash to continue to increase in fiscal '17 as a result of our international businesses. 
The final item I will cover is the future exercise of the 2017 warrant. Because of our hedging strategy, we are fully covered from any potential adjusted EPS dilution when our share price is $88 or lower. We will certainly monitor this as we progress towards the exercise window, which is March 2017 to September 2017. As a reminder, roughly 60% of the warrant proceeds will be used to exercise our cap call options with the investment bank and purchase shares needed to successfully complete the hedge. The remaining proceeds are expected to be used to repay the 2017 bond that we originally issued in connection with the hedging program. 
As I close my comments, we are on a different trajectory for the remainder of fiscal '16 and also for fiscal '17 than we had originally anticipated. However, we are well positioned to navigate through a challenging environment, drive efficiency and thoughtfully deploy capital in a manner that drives long-term shareholder value. 
Now I will turn it back to Steve"

As we look ahead to the second half of our fiscal year and into next year, there is no doubt that we have some challenging work ahead as we navigate the headwinds that Tim outlined. But I am certain that we have the right team in place, not only to meet this near-term challenge, but also to ensure that we do not lose sight of the many long-term opportunities that are ahead of us. 
Let's look at each of the foundational pieces of our business more closely. We are very fortunate to be heavily weighted to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry where organic market growth rate is expected to be 7% to 8% over the next several years. This is an extremely significant benefit that our industry enjoys, and all U.S. wholesalers are beneficiaries of this market growth, especially to the extent that it is being driven by demographics and improving access to care. Market growth in the U.S. is also driven by new brand product introductions, both in more traditional therapy and in innovative specialty products and to a lesser extent by branded drug inflation. Of course, going forward, there will be less erosion at the top line from new generic launches. The large U.S. wholesalers together comprise the most efficient distribution network in the world and provide tremendous value to the pharmaceutical supply channel. AmerisourceBergen has distinguished itself within this accomplished group with its portfolio of services with specialty and biotech manufacturers and for the healthcare providers that administer these innovative products. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. The economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit and the extent to which we could add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by physicians that is treating a patient in a community setting because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
While the prices of some of these specialty drugs get a lot of attention, we should not lose sight of the fact that these products treat extremely serious illnesses. In many cases, our life-saving products were life-changing drugs that make a previously intractable disease manageable. While we certainly understand the need to manage the cost of care, the physicians and other healthcare providers who treat the sickest patients should not themselves be economically harmed simply by choosing the best available therapy for their patient. 
As someone who has been working around community physicians, including oncologists, for over 20 years, I want to comment specifically on CMS' proposed demonstration project on Part B drugs. There is little evidence, if any, that physicians are systematically and inappropriately prescribing expensive therapy. The proposal ignores the reimbursement challenges physicians already face on many Part B medications, such as those that remain in place as a result of sequestration. The cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the unintended consequences of further reductions should be carefully studied because it is the patient that will bear the ultimate burden, both in terms of the economics and in terms of the quality of their lives. We are hopeful that the issues of the proposal will be addressed and it will not be implemented in its current form. 
Turning back to our business. Portfolio of services -- the portfolio of services we offer applies broadly to potentially all pharmaceuticals. And going forward, we will move to a pricing model that is more balanced between generic and brand products. Today, the basic logistics of warehousing and distributing the products is the bedrock of what we do, and additional services we provide have greatly differentiated our place in the market. We can meet the needs of pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers as virtually every point in a drug's life cycle, from the clinical trial phase through commercialization of the brand and into patient and product support for mature therapies and eventually through the launch of generic or biosimilar versions of products. The portfolio of offerings we have built over the last decade will be even more important in the market that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency. 
Solid organic market growth and the right portfolio of services are critical components of increasing revenues. But to take full advantage of those cornerstones, we need to be aligned with the right customers, and this is another area where I believe we excel. AmerisourceBergen has an unparalleled group of marquee customers with whom we've established long-term relationships. As both Tim and I mentioned earlier, we are thrilled to extend our innovative and highly successful partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance, and we look forward to continuing to reap the mutual benefits of this unique and collaborative relationship well beyond the original 10-year term. This relationship has greatly benefited both parties and has financially exceeded our expectations. 
I am also pleased that Express Scripts has decided to exercise their option to extend their current contract for an additional year. We've been working with this market-leading pharmacy benefit manager for the last 4 years, and we continue to look for new ways we can partner together to drive value for the long term. We now have several of our largest customers in each of our key segments under long-term contract and that we hope -- and we hope that we'll soon be able to say the same about Kaiser Permanente. Over many years, we have deliberately chosen specific customers whom we believe will be on the cutting-edge of pharmaceutical care and therefore grow faster than the market over the long run. 
In addition to the 3 customers already mentioned, we renewed our largest independent GPO customer, CPA, during the quarter. And of course, we have our largest government contract, the Department of Defense, also on a long-term contract. This strategy has already paid dividends and will continue to do so for many years to come. 
Our focus on high-quality customers is not limited to just the very largest in the marketplace. We have extensive relationships with prudent drug retailers, institutions and other types of healthcare providers of various shapes and sizes and have long been champions of both independent community pharmacy and of specialty physicians in community practice, for example. We will continue to make investments to ensure that we meet specific site-of-care needs as well as to serve providers who integrate offerings across different channels. And I think that AmerisourceBergen is the best-positioned in the market to deliver meaningful innovation in these areas. 
Another key customer group is of course our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. Our extensive array of manufacturer services businesses are another meaningful differentiator for ABC, and these businesses are and will continue to be among the fastest growing in our company. Whether we are working on clinical trial logistics in World Courier, working on reimbursement and commercialization strategies within our consulting business or supporting patient assistance programs built around some of the more complex therapies, I believe the suite of services will only become more valuable in the future. As manufacturers must demonstrate value and comparative effectiveness and patient adherence becomes more essential and less exceptional and complex biosimilars are launched at the marketplace, AmerisourceBergen will be the partner of choice. 
Serving customers well is absolutely required in today's market, and we must continue to do so in the most efficient manner possible. While our expenses have increased in recent years and will continue to rise somewhat as we integrate our recent acquisitions and make some additional investments in our information technology systems and other infrastructure, I want to assure you that we remain focused on being the most efficient operator in the industry. 
As cost pressures increase across the board in health care, it is even more important that we manage our own with an increasingly higher degree of precision than we've done historically. We have always skillfully ran lean operations. This is an area where we need to apply even greater creativity and sensitivity to what needs to be done to meet the needs of customers and where we can strip out unproductive expenses. This is a process that never ends, and it is important to remember that investments we are making today will ultimately lower our cost of doing business in the future. 
As we grow our revenues, efficiently run our operations and cycle through the working capital investment that Tim discussed, we expect to be able to generate strong cash flow over the long term. This has long been our hallmark of our business and is one of the key ways in which we have driven shareholder value. We remain committed to be excellent stewards of capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to have a balanced approach to deploying our cash going forward. 
Our track record in this area is very strong. We have had successful internal projects like Bluepoint; the NDC, National Distribution Center; and more recently, Certio. In addition, we have made very successful strategic investments in 3 market leaders: World Courier; MWI Animal Health, formerly Veterinary Supply; and PharMEDium. These 3 large acquisitions have strengthened our business in key areas, and all of them have exceeded our expectations in terms of their operational and financial in performance and have yielded important strategic benefits. Looking ahead, we will continue to look for high-quality assets in the pharmaceutical channel that have great potential to deliver long-term value. 
In addition, of course, we will continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the near term, we remain committed to offsetting the potential dilution from the exercise of the 2017 warrant. And over the longer term, we will be as thoughtful and resourceful with our capital deployment as we have always been since the inception of AmerisourceBergen. 
In summary, while we are disappointed in our near-term forecast, I hope all of our stakeholders share my great conviction and confidence in AmerisourceBergen franchise. Our management team, our portfolio offerings and our collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger. As I've said on many occasions, while we focus on delivering short-term results, we are obsessed with delivering long-term performance that reflects ABC's excellent position, thought leadership and customer focus. Ultimately, it is our dedication to continuous improvement, the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution, our financial performance and our thoughtful capital management that will help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come. 
Now I will turn it over to Barbara to begin Q&A."

That definitely changed on us from where we communicated to The Street and to our investors and stakeholders back on Q1. It was probably very low single digit. So that moved against us by the time we got to March. And as we forecast out for the balance of the year, we expect that to increase. And that's -- again we think that's related to just more supply in the channel. And certainly we factor that into thinking that's going to remain so into '17. And it's a headwind. I'm not going to comment on dollars, but we sell a lot of generics through our Pro program. And again when you do the math, 1% change in deflation and having lower GP dollars is certainly a headwind that we have to work through."

We're talking now specifically about the drug company. It's obviously a bit different in our specialty business and very different in, say, our Veterinary or PharMEDium business. But what we try and accomplish in the long term is a bit of balancing contributions between brand, generic and specialty therapy, which will include biosimilars and precision medicine products and cell-based therapies. So all of these are -- all of these new innovative products, we expect to get a fair return on. And that's a discussion we're having with our customers and definitely a discussion we're having with our manufacturers as well. Now the reality is that the sale side takes time to catch up with the buy side. And by sale side, we mean the contracts that we have with providers. So we've seen some very rapid changes in the marketplace with -- it's probably we believe growth in the industry will be driven by -- more by innovation than by inflation on established products even if they are not subject to generic competition. So it's very important that we have all these product categories be profitable for us, and that's what we really are talking about.

Lisa, thank you for the question. We think -- it's a mix of customer base that we have, including being with some of the fastest growers like WBA and our ties to the specialty marketing, including we do a lot of specialty pharmacy business in our core drug wholesale business. We do expect to grow revenue slightly above the market. And then because we have a strong association or weighting towards those large customers and because of the mixes that we see, we don't expect to be able to keep our gross profit growth up with that revenue growth. But we do expect that we're going to have operating leverage because of the different investments that we're making. So it won't be scaled coming from that. And we are moving ahead rapidly with integrating MWI and PharMEDium, which has really severely impacted our expense rate. Another good benefit that we have is on improving tax rate, and then I think ABC has excelled in capital deployments, not only on acquisitions, but on buying shares back at the right time. And this is my 20th quarter, and I think when I did my first quarter, we were at the mid- to high 30s. And so we've done very, very well with that. Something that I'm very proud of and we talked on the quarter about Certio and our national replenishment center, these projects -- BluePoint, these projects have really been outstanding. And as you know, again depending on what happens in the market and how cash flow progresses, and we're all forecasting in the long run 125%. That's quite implicit in Tim's comments. So we would have opportunities. And certainly at lower stock prices, share repo becomes a lot more compelling to us. So those will be the drivers for our long-term growth model."

So we have a very well-demonstrated trend that we are -- I think are doing a outstanding job as an industry of explaining the strength. I think people understand it. It's well understood as to how the industry is changing. And it just makes sense because the price of these products and the value that they represent is very different than traditional oral solid brand medications, and also they apply to smaller patient populations and there's complex standing requirements, complex reimbursement. So AmerisourceBergen has been in this for a long time. So recently at a strategic review for our specialty group, and they made a very interesting observation that I think is pertinent. And it's really that the brand -- the specialty business has become the brand business, and the future specialty businesses will be orphan drugs, biosimilars, precision medicine, cell-based therapy, and I think that's where AmerisourceBergen will excel and differentiate ourselves. But Bob Mauch and his team, as I said earlier, and also Peyton Howell in our GSMR side, our global supply chain side, are really focused on talking to manufacturers about the strength, making sure we get fair reimbursement. And we need to talk to -- we are talking, not only to the Walgreens and the Express Scripts, but we have a big specialty pharmacy customer base. We have a big alternate care customer base. We have a big health system and hospital GPO customer base, and all of these customers need to really move along.

But approximately, 2/3 of the lower forecast, we would say, is really environmental, and then approximately 1/3 is from not getting to the growth targets that we expected in ProGen. Now it's interesting because we've-- as you can imagine, we've dug very deep into this, and our unit sales are not off that much. It really is the generic deflation and the lower average selling prices on a lot of generics that are not causing our generic sales and the weighting that, that implies to be as high as we anticipated, honestly even in February. And that's about 1/3 of them is along with what we've seen in the last quarter and the next 2 quarters, which is that generic efficiency rate that we're experiencing as a wholesaler. It doesn't mean that the market is not being as efficient. It just means we're only seeing about that 50% conversion. So we definitely lost a couple of percent of anticipated earnings from generic launches.

Our brand, the wholesale industry has well over the 90% coverage. And in generic, it's a lot less because there still are opportunities. And this is an opportunity for us to do more generic distribution with self-warehousing customers. So that is definitely what we think of as an opportunity.

Let me start by saying that while we delivered solid performance in our March quarter, we are disappointed that the forecast we have presented for the second half of our fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 fall below our historical rates of performance. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our industry and our company, and we are well positioned, with the right customers and the right portfolio of services for both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Certain areas of our business are performing very well, including both of our recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our specialty group, including the distribution businesses that service -- that serve physicians and our consulting businesses had a very strong March quarter. In addition, we recently achieved 2 key customer renewals or extensions in AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, including a 3-year extension with our strategic long-term partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance; and a 1-year extension with Express Scripts, our second-largest customer. 
ABDC is, however, being adversely impacted by several factors, including accelerating deflation on generic drugs and a lower contribution from generic launches. These unanticipated trends have exasperated the expected impact from a shift in product mix towards lower margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs as well as the lack of generic inflation we discussed in our Q1 call. As we work through these challenges, our overall earnings growth rate will slow somewhat. Tim will discuss the March quarter results and walk through our detailed guidance for the second half of fiscal 2016 and our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017. Then I will outline the ways we intend to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that are in front of us before we open the call to Q&A.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same quarter",2884,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our adjusted results. Please note that all financial comparisons are for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. Also, let me point out that after this quarter, we fully anniversary the impact of adding MWI into our consolidated financial results. My comments will be a little lengthier this morning as I have a fair amount to cover in 3 primary areas. First, I will recap our fiscal Q2 consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations; and third, I will provide some brief commentary on how we are thinking about fiscal '17. Even though it's early, we will provide initial thoughts in a few key areas. 
With that, we can begin our fiscal Q2 review. Revenues were $35.7 billion, up 9.3%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment continued to account for the majority of our revenue growth due to our diverse customer mix. Our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium, combined, accounted for roughly 2% of our consolidated revenue growth. 
The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 12% to $1.2 billion. The dollar growth was due to our 2 acquisitions, MWI and PharMEDium. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, specifically the drug company, was challenged this quarter with a difficult comparison. They continued to experience headwinds from contract renewals and lower generic inflation. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 18% to $575 million. Roughly 80% of the increase was related to our 2 acquisitions. Excluding the incremental OpEx impact from these 2 companies, our comparable OpEx growth rate would have been about 4%. As you have come to expect from ABC, we are prudent with expense spending. This has always been one of ABC's core operating practices, and it will remain so going forward. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $592 million, up about $40 million or 7%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.66%, down 3 basis points from the prior year, driven mostly by the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment being down 8 basis points this quarter. 
Moving below the operating income line, interest expense net was about $31 million, up significantly from last year due entirely to the financing costs of the MWI and PharMEDium acquisitions. 
Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.3% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. This quarter's rates include the onetime rate benefits of 1.4% from adjusting our estimated year-to-date cash rate, specifically related to the expansion of our international operations, which are taxed at a lower rate. We now expect our full year cash rate to be approximately 33%. 
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $1.68, driven mostly by the income from our 2 recent acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, from our lower consolidated tax rate. 
Our adjusted diluted share count was about 229 million shares, down some from last year. 
This finishes our review of ABC consolidated results. Let's move forward and discuss our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $34.2 billion, up nearly 8%. Our Drug company had a growth rate of about 6%. This growth was net of revenue headwind of about 2% due to lower hepatitis C sales in the market and also a transfer of certain oncology sales to our specialty business. Drug company had solid growth across its chain customers, including Walgreens, and also in their hospital segment. Our specialty business group had another outstanding quarter with revenue increasing about 18%, driven mostly by volume growth. Similar to last quarter, we continue to have meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across a few of our businesses and also from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business. 
ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for roughly 28% of specialty revenue growth, primarily due to a new manufacturer relationship they added late last year. This is our eighth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our specialty group. We continue to be very pleased with their performance. It clearly helped to differentiate ABC from the rest of the market. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $882 million, up about $33 million or about 4%. The majority of the growth in gross profit dollars was in our drug company, specifically the benefit from PharMEDium. Excluding the acquisition benefit, drug company was behind last year's gross profit due to the headwinds I called out previously, the tough comparison on drug price inflation and contract renewals. 
Segment operating income was $498 million and was up 2%. Our specialty business continued with their high level of performance, offset by the lower performance of our drug company. 
Before I finish up the segment, let me comment this was our first full quarter of reporting PharMEDium. Financially, they are contributing better than we expected as a result of strong operational performance. For the quarter, volume growth as a percentage was in the mid-teens. The business has integrated especially well into the drug company. We are off to a great start with PharMEDium. 
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI, Consulting Services and World Courier. In the March quarter, segment revenues were about $1.6 billion, up significantly due to adding MWI. As a reminder, our March 2015 quarterly results included about 5 weeks of MWI's operating results. Growth in just Consulting and World Courier combined was about 13%. These businesses continue to grow their top line revenue, primarily as a result of providing additional services and growing volumes with existing customers, which is a clear indicator of customer satisfaction and value. 
MWI continues to perform especially well. Percentage revenue growth for -- in the companion animal segment in the low teens, and we saw a nice recovery in the production animal segment with percentage revenue growth in the high single digits. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $94 million. MWI contributed a significant amount of the dollar increase. Our Consulting business also had excellent income growth in the quarter.  
The segment's operating margin was down about 60 basis points. This is the result of MWI becoming a much larger percentage of the results and having a lower margin in comparison to the 2 other businesses within the Other segment. 
During the March quarter, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of acquiring MWI. We want to thank Jim Cleary and the entire MWI team for an outstanding first year. We continue to be impressed with the passion and knowledge their associates demonstrate every day, partnering with our customers and the manufacturers. And importantly, the MWI business has outperformed our first year financial expectation. They are on strong footing and on track to deliver the long-term returns we anticipated. 
I'd like to switch over now and cover a few key working capital and cash flow items. In the March quarter, we had solid free cash flow of $790 million. This quarter historically has been our strongest cash quarter of the year as we cycle through the seasonal inventory build from calendar year-end. At March 31, we had roughly $2.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes roughly $400 million offshore, related primarily to our World Courier and Switzerland businesses. 
During the quarter, we purchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization. As noted in this morning's press release, we announced that our Board authorized a new regular share repurchase program that together with the availability under the existing share program permits us to purchase up to $750 million of our shares. 
Also, back in mid-March, we filed an 8-K announcing that Walgreens exercised their 2016 stock warrants through our hedging program. As we committed, we successfully offset the EPS diluted impact from the 23 million shares issued to Walgreens. In conjunction with its hedging program, the company, through an investment bank, executed call options to purchase ABC shares. The funding of the call option transaction was not entirely completed in the March quarter. We paid $218 million to the investment bank in the March quarter, and the remaining amount, $483 million, was paid to the bank in April. 
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. I must acknowledge that revising our adjusted EPS guidance downward a second time is very disappointing to us. Adverse market trends, centered around generic pricing, have been -- have become more acute than we anticipated, and a strategic initiative to offset some of these pressures has not yet yielded the results we expected. While generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of generic drug deflation is slowly increasing and is higher than the level we previously expected in fiscal '16 and expected to get slightly worse by year-end. This is driven in part by the increased supply of generic product in the channel. While we are protected from inventory losses on deflationary products, it's difficult to continue to earn the same gross profit dollars on decreasing prices. We have had some success in being made whole through new incentives or rebates or by increasing generic sales volumes, but we are not always 100% successful in achieving this. Combined with this, our gross profit contributions from new generic launches are decreasing as brand manufacturers increasingly find ways to protect and retain market share. 
Additionally, after several years of a favorable branded generic revenue mix in our drug company business, this trend is starting to reverse. As more lower-margin branded specialty drugs shift primarily to hospitals and specialty pharmacies through full-line distribution at our Drug company, these revenues do not currently provide enough gross profit dollars to overcome the decline in generic drug gross profit. 
With regard to our strategic initiative, our drug company about a year ago set forth on a strategic initiative to grow its independent retail business, and in conjunction with this, grow ProGenerics revenues. The business added new management and additional resources, made investments in innovative programs and aligned internal incentives. We'd expected to see meaningful progress in our June and September '16 quarters from these investments and efforts. While we are making progress, the financial contribution is ramping slower than anticipated. Based on the 2 headwinds that I covered and the negative impact from previously disclosed contract renewals, the drug company's fiscal '16 operating income will be lower on a year-over-year basis, even with PharMEDium included. 
Our revised fiscal '16 P&L guidance is as follows. Revenues, we are now guiding to ABC consolidated revenue growth of approximately 8% for the full fiscal year. Operating income, we expect growth in consolidated operating income to be in the range of 5% to 6% as a result of the lower second half expectations and lower-than-expected performance of our drug company. Included in this growth is a benefit from measures we plan to take to reduce our expense structure going forward. Adjusted EPS, we now expect our fiscal '16 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.54, which is growth of 10% to 12%. As I just highlighted, our EPS range includes the benefit of several cents from expense reductions we will be implementing in the second half of the fiscal year. 
I'd like to now cover our revised guidance on free cash flow and also share repurchases. This morning, we issued a separate press release announcing our contract amendment with our largest customer, Walgreens. As we disclosed, we have entered into a 3-year contract extension with our anchor partner for both the distribution agreement and the generic sourcing agreement. In the past, we have disclosed that this customer accounted for about 30% of our consolidated revenues. 
In our view, there are few customers that have both the scale and growth profile like Walgreens. The relationship, now in its fourth year, has exceeded our initial financial projections and has provided an excellent return to our shareholders. In exchange for the extensions, we agreed to make additional working capital and infrastructure investments during the next several months and also into fiscal '17. Some of these investments, including carrying extra inventory to maximize service levels, have recently started. Because of these working capital investments, we are now revising our free cash flow guidance to $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year. And this now includes the tax benefit for the 2016 warrant exercise. 
For share repurchases, using a portion of the cash from the warrant exercise, we expect to increase our repurchases, which will now total between $350 million and $450 million. As always, share repurchases are subject to change, depending on market conditions, our second half of the year cash position and other competing capital needs. 
The third and final topic I want to cover this morning is commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Since we changed our assumptions around the second half of fiscal '16, we thought it was important to provide a preliminary look at next year, fiscal '17. Revenues, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to be slightly better than market. Operating income, the headwinds that I called out related to the second half of fiscal '16 will continue well into fiscal '17. Also, we do expect to have headwinds from both the Kaiser and CPA contract renewals for half of the fiscal year. Consequently, our drug company's operating income expected -- is expected to be up just slightly, and this includes solid growth from PharMEDium. Adjusted EPS growth, we expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the midpoint of our revised fiscal '16 guidance range. I should highlight that the 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth is net of a 3% headwind from the incremental expenses to support key business investments in IT systems and infrastructure. These investments support our growth, drive customer satisfaction and further increase our operating efficiency. We expect to realize meaningful expense savings from these incremental investments of at least $30 million annually beginning in fiscal '19. 
The preliminary view of our fiscal '17 outlook includes several key assumptions as follows: one, we are expecting generic drug deflation to be in the high single digits by fiscal year end '16, and more importantly, we are forecasting that generic drug deflation will stay in this range for the entire fiscal '17; two, our tax rate will be slightly lower in fiscal '17; three, we have limited capital deployment in our adjusted EPS range, we plan to complete enough share repurchases to offset stock option exercises; four, that we retain Kaiser, an important customer of the drug company; five, we are not including any new business resulting from our relationship with our largest customer; six, we have not included any impact from the proposed CMS Medicare Part B reimbursement proposal as it's too early to ascertain the likelihood that this will be successfully implemented; and seven, we are not assuming a meaningful contribution from biosimilars. 
Moving to free cash flow preliminary guidance and cash availability. As I mentioned earlier, we have agreed to make working capital investments as a result of the Walgreens contract amendment. The working capital impact is greater in fiscal '17 than fiscal '16. Also, the impact primarily affects the first half of our fiscal '17. We anticipate that our capital spend will increase as we invest in our drug distribution network due to age of the network and also to increase capacity. Additionally, we are making key IT platform investments in our Consulting and World Courier businesses. Both have older systems that are inefficient and costly. As a result of these investments, we expect that our free cash flow in fiscal '17 will be approximately equal to or just slightly below our adjusted net income. 
An important point, once we cycle through the impacts from the Walgreens working capital investment and the higher CapEx in fiscal '17, our aspirational goal in fiscal '18 and beyond would be to have free cash flow of at least 125% of net income each year, assuming over time we maintain our current terms with customers and suppliers. From a cash availability standpoint, I should mention that we expect our offshore cash to continue to increase in fiscal '17 as a result of our international businesses. 
The final item I will cover is the future exercise of the 2017 warrant. Because of our hedging strategy, we are fully covered from any potential adjusted EPS dilution when our share price is $88 or lower. We will certainly monitor this as we progress towards the exercise window, which is March 2017 to September 2017. As a reminder, roughly 60% of the warrant proceeds will be used to exercise our cap call options with the investment bank and purchase shares needed to successfully complete the hedge. The remaining proceeds are expected to be used to repay the 2017 bond that we originally issued in connection with the hedging program. 
As I close my comments, we are on a different trajectory for the remainder of fiscal '16 and also for fiscal '17 than we had originally anticipated. However, we are well positioned to navigate through a challenging environment, drive efficiency and thoughtfully deploy capital in a manner that drives long-term shareholder value. 
Now I will turn it back to Steve"

As we look ahead to the second half of our fiscal year and into next year, there is no doubt that we have some challenging work ahead as we navigate the headwinds that Tim outlined. But I am certain that we have the right team in place, not only to meet this near-term challenge, but also to ensure that we do not lose sight of the many long-term opportunities that are ahead of us. 
Let's look at each of the foundational pieces of our business more closely. We are very fortunate to be heavily weighted to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, where the organic market growth rate is expected to be 7% to 8% over the next several years. This is an extremely significant benefit that our industry enjoys, and all U.S. wholesalers are beneficiaries of this market growth, especially to the extent that it is being driven by demographics and improving access to care. Market growth for the U.S. is also driven by new brand product introductions, both in more traditional therapies and in innovative specialty products and to a lesser extent by branded drug inflation. Of course, going forward, there will be less erosion at the top line from new generic launches. The large U.S. wholesalers together comprise the most efficient distribution network in the world and provide tremendous value to the pharmaceutical supply channel. AmerisourceBergen has distinguished itself within this accomplished group with its portfolio of services for specialty and biotech manufacturers and for the healthcare providers that administer these innovative products. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. The economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by a physician that is treating a patient in a community setting, because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
While the prices of some of these specialty drugs get a lot of attention, we should not lose sight of the fact that these products treat extremely serious illnesses. In many cases, our life-saving products or life-changing drugs can make a previously intractable disease manageable. While we certainly understand the need to manage the cost of care, the physicians and other healthcare providers who treat the sickest patients should not themselves be economically harmed simply by choosing the best available therapy for their patient. 
As someone who has been working around community physicians, including oncologists, for over 20 years, I want to comment specifically on CMS' proposed demonstration project on Part B drugs. There is little evidence, if any, that physicians are systematically and inappropriately prescribing expensive therapy. The proposal ignores the reimbursement challenges physicians already face on many Part B medications, such as those that remain in place as a result of sequestration. The costs to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the unintended consequences of further reductions should be carefully studied, because it is the patient that will bear the ultimate burden, both in terms of the economics and in terms of the quality of their lives. We are hopeful that the issues of the proposal will be addressed and it will not be implemented in its current form. 
Turning back to our business. Portfolio of services -- the portfolio of services we offer applies broadly to potentially all pharmaceuticals. And going forward, we will move to a pricing model that is more balanced between generic and brand products. Today, the basic logistics of warehousing and distributing the products is the bedrock of what we do, and additional services we provide have greatly differentiated our place in the market. We can meet the needs of pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers at virtually every point in a drug's life cycle, from the clinical trial phase through commercialization of the brand and into patient and product support for mature therapies and eventually through the launch of generic or biosimilar versions of products. The portfolio of offerings we have built over the last decade will be even more important in a market that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency. 
Solid organic market growth and the right portfolio of services are critical components of increasing revenues. But to take full advantage of those cornerstones, we need to be aligned with the right customers, and this is another area where I believe we excel. AmerisourceBergen has an unparalleled group of marquee customers with whom we've established long-term relationships. As both Tim and I mentioned earlier, we are thrilled to extend our innovative and highly successful partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance, and we look forward to continuing to reap the mutual benefits of this unique and collaborative relationship well beyond the original 10-year term. This relationship has greatly benefited both parties and has financially exceeded our expectations. 
I am also pleased that Express Scripts has decided to exercise their option to extend their current contract for an additional year. We've been working with this market-leading pharmacy benefit manager for the last 4 years, and we continue to look for new ways we can partner together to drive value for the long term. We now have several of our largest customers in each of our key segments under a long-term contract and that we hope -- and we hope that we will soon be able to say the same about Kaiser Permanente. Over many years, we have deliberately chosen specific customers whom we believe would be on the cutting-edge of pharmaceutical care and therefore grow faster than the market over the long run. 
In addition to the 3 customers I already mentioned, we renewed our largest independent GPO customer, CPA, during the quarter. And of course, we have our largest government contract, the Department of Defense, also on a long-term contract. This strategy has already paid dividends and will continue to do so for many years to come. 
Our focus on high-quality customers is not limited to just the very largest in the marketplace. We have extensive relationships with prudent drug retailers, institutions and other types of healthcare providers of various shapes and sizes and have long been champions of both independent community pharmacies and of specialty physicians in community practice, for example. We will continue to make investments to ensure that we meet specific site-of-care needs as well as to serve providers who integrate offerings across different channels. And I think that AmerisourceBergen is the best-positioned in the market to deliver meaningful innovation in these areas. 
Another key customer group is of course our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. Our extensive array of manufacturer services businesses are another meaningful differentiator for ABC, and these businesses are and will continue to be among the fastest growing in our company. Whether we are working on clinical trial logistics in World Courier, working on reimbursement and commercialization strategies within our consulting business or supporting patient assistance programs built around some of the more complex therapies, I believe this suite of services will only become more valuable in the future. As manufacturers must demonstrate value and comparative effectiveness and patient adherence becomes more essential and less exceptional and complex biosimilars are launched into the marketplace, AmerisourceBergen will be the partner of choice. 
Serving customers well is absolutely required in today's market, and we must continue to do so in the most efficient manner possible. While our expenses have increased in recent years and will continue to rise somewhat as we integrate our recent acquisitions and make some additional investments in our information technology systems and other infrastructure, I want to assure you that we remain focused on being the most efficient operator in the industry. 
As cost pressures increase across the board in health care, it is even more important that we manage our own with an increasingly higher degree of precision than we've done historically. We have always skillfully run lean operations. But this is an area where we need to apply even greater creativity and sensitivity to what needs to be done to meet the needs of customers and where we can strip out unproductive expenses. This is a process that never ends, and it is important to remember that the investments we are making today will ultimately lower our cost of doing business in the future. 
As we grow our revenues, efficiently run our operations and cycle through the working capital investment that Tim discussed, we expect to be able to generate strong cash flow over the long term. This has long been a hallmark of our business and is one of the key ways in which we have driven shareholder value. We remain committed to being excellent stewards of capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to have a balanced approach to deploying our cash going forward. 
Our track record in this area is very strong. We have had successful internal projects like Bluepoint; the NDC, National Distribution Center; and more recently, Certio. In addition, we have made very successful strategic investments in 3 market leaders: World Courier; MWI Animal Health, formerly Veterinary Supply; and PharMEDium. These 3 large acquisitions have strengthened our business in key areas, and all of them have exceeded our expectations in terms of their operational and financial in performance and have yielded important strategic benefits. Looking ahead, we will continue to look for high-quality assets in the pharmaceutical channel that have great potential to deliver long-term value. 
In addition, of course, we will continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the near term, we remain committed to offsetting the potential dilution from the exercise of the 2017 warrant. And over the longer term, we will be as thoughtful and resourceful with our capital deployment as we have always been since the inception of AmerisourceBergen. 
In summary, while we are disappointed in our near-term forecast, I hope all of our stakeholders share my great conviction and confidence in our AmerisourceBergen franchise. Our management team, our portfolio offerings and our collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger. As I've said on many occasions, while we focus on delivering short-term results, we are obsessed with delivering long-term performance that reflects ABC's excellent position, thought leadership and customer focus. Ultimately, it is our dedication to continuous improvement in the quality of our offerings, our seamless execution, our financial performance and our thoughtful capital management that will help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.

We're talking now specifically about the drug company. It's obviously a bit different in our specialty business and very different in, say, our veterinary or PharMEDium business. But what we try and accomplish in the long term is a better balance in contributions between brand, generic and specialty therapies, which would include biosimilars and precision medicine products and cell-based therapies. So all of these are -- all of these new innovative products, we expect to get a fair return on. And that's a discussion we're having with our customers and definitely a discussion we're having with manufacturers as well. Now the reality is that the sell side takes time to catch up with the buy side. And by sell side, we mean the contracts that we have with providers. So we've seen some very rapid changes in the marketplace with -- probably we believe growth in the industry will be driven by -- more by innovation than by inflation on established products, even if they're not subject to generic competition.

Lisa, thank you for the question. We think -- with the mix of customer base that we have, including being with some of the fastest growers like WBA and our ties to the specialty marketing, including we do a lot of specialty pharmacy business in our core drug wholesale business, we do expect to grow revenue slightly above the market. And then because we have a strong association or weighting towards those larger customers and because of the mixes that we see, we don't expect to be able to keep our gross profit growth up with that revenue growth. But we do expect that we're going to have operating leverage because of the different investments that we're making. So it won't be scaled coming from that. And we are moving ahead rapidly with integrating MWI and PharMEDium, which has really severely impacted our expense rate. Another good benefit that we have is our improving tax rate, and then I think ABC has excelled in capital deployment, not only on acquisitions, but on buying shares back at the right time. And this is my 20th quarter, and I think when I did my first quarter, we were in the mid- to high 30s. And so we've done very, very well with that. Something that I'm very proud of and we talked on the quarter about Certio and our national replenishment center, these projects -- BluePoint, these projects have really been outstanding. And as you know, again depending on what happens in the market and how our cash flow progresses, and we are forecasting in the long run 125%. That's quite implicit in Tim's comments.

But I would say, in my commentary, I talked about maybe a different trend in the market that has started and seems to be progressing, and that's brand manufacturers are retaining market through copay cards and maybe some rebates. And I would say in the past, we -- when we converted to a generic, we saw pretty high immediate penetration rates in the market, upwards of maybe 90%. Now when we convert on a generic, we see penetration rates that are more 50% or 60%, and that puts some pressure on generic profitability, on launches. So that is definitely what we see. And that's just, I think, an evolution of the market and it's just something where -- we have to work through. Generics are still profitable. But again, I would say as we stand here today, looking out this year for some launches and even into next year, we're signaling that they just might not contribute to the level we expected."

So my question is how will you go about trying to change this? And where do you get leverage, maybe not just with those 2 customers, but across the channel to change specialty pricing and margin in a traditional wholesale business where there's been a move toward net-net pricing?"

And actually, if I was a revisionist, I agree with you that the specialty should have been a separate class of trade. But I think, in a way, because we had the patent expiration opportunity for several years, that sort of covered for the weighting of specialty drugs. So the way we're going to get through this is through communication and trust. So we have a very well-demonstrated trend that we are -- I think are doing an outstanding job as an industry of explaining this trend. I think people understand it. It's well understood as to how the industry is changing. And it just makes sense because the price of these products and the value that they represent is very different than traditional oral solid brand medications, and also they apply to smaller patient populations and there's complex handling requirements, complex reimbursement. So AmerisourceBergen has been in this for a long time. So recently at a strategic review for our specialty group, and they made a very interesting observation that I think is pertinent. And it's really that the brand -- the specialty business has become the brand business, and the future specialty businesses will be orphan drugs, biosimilars, precision medicine, cell-based therapies, and I think that's where AmerisourceBergen will excel and differentiate ourselves. But Bob Mauch and his team, as I said earlier, and also Peyton Howell in our GSMR side, our global supply chain side, are really focused on talking to manufacturers about this trend, making sure we get fair reimbursement. And we need to talk to -- we are talking, not only to the Walgreens and the Express Scripts, but we have a big specialty pharmacy customer base. We have a big alternate care customer base. We have a big health system and hospital GPO customer base, and all of these customers need to really move along. And as we get through the contracting phase, it is our strong intention that we will make a profit on specialty drugs and innovative therapies, wherever the site of care is."

But my question, if you'll allow that to not count for my one, is that on the ProGenerics commentary, I wouldn't have thought that a slow ramp in ProGenerics on increasing independent retail sales would have made a big enough dent into EPS guidance to call it out. So could you maybe give us a little bit more on how much of the change in EPS is attributable to this phenomenon?

What we're talking -- and Tim can give you more color. But approximately, 2/3 of the lower forecast, we would say, is really environmental, and then approximately 1/3 is from not getting to the growth target that we expected in ProGen. Now it's interesting because we've-- as you can imagine, we've dug very deep into this, and our unit sales are not off that much. It really is the generic deflation and the lower average selling prices on a lot of generics that are not causing our generic sales and the weighting that, that implies to be as high as we anticipated, honestly, even in February. And that's about 1/3 of them is, along with what we've seen in the last quarter and the next 2 quarters, which is that generic efficiency rate that we're experiencing as a wholesaler. It doesn't mean that the market is not being as efficient. It just means that we're only seeing about that 50% conversion. So we've definitely lost a couple of percent of anticipated earnings from generic launches. And also even in our specialty group, there was a big launch we were expecting that we did not receive as well, so it has not been a year that we've received the benefits from generic launches that we expected.

I am pleased to report solid performance in our June quarter and good progress on the objectives for fiscal 2016 that we laid out in early May. Revenues were up nearly 8% and adjusted EPS was up 40%. 
Certain areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisition, MWI Neri supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group also continued its strong performance in the June quarter. In AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, we renewed our distribution relationship with Kaiser Permanente or Favio, and achieved the benefit of some expense reduction earlier than expected. With many of our launch customer renewal now behind us, we feel really good about our market position in all of our key portfolio segments. While there are still work to be done, I am thrilled to commend our associates for their successful work and dedication in ensuring that we are well positioned as we approach the end of the fiscal year and look ahead towards next year.
As I've said many times, we are fortunate to play a key role in a vibrant industry and to have a stronghold in the U.S. market, which is still the best market in the world. U.S. organic sales growth continues to be strong and the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry dynamics remain competitive, but stable. In addition, we take great pride in our ability to increasingly meet the needs of our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners on a global scale and to use our extensive knowledge, reach and partnership philosophy to help our health care provider customers better serve their patients. 
Turning now to our performance in the quarter. Tim will provide the details, but I want to highlight some key items. I just returned from spot, our annual retail trade show in Las Vegas where we hosted a record number of independent community pharmacy attendees. I was excited to see firsthand the enthusiasm with which our independent customers are embracing our new offerings. 
In Las Vegas, we renewed our long-standing commitment to community pharmacy, and we highlighted several resources we had been investing in to ensure our GNP stores remain successful. 
Our government advocacy resources include a new Internet site called ourindependentvoice.com, which provides pharmacist with a centralized place to access tools to drive advocacy movement and stay operation of community and legislative developments. 
Our front end retail excellence program helps our members optimize front in sales, take advantage of manufacture promotions and make better use of point-of-sale data and reporting tools. We have one thing in good use ABC order, our next-generation ordering platform that is specifically engineered to within pharmacy workflow and will be available in 2017. 
While community provide a certain face challenges in the rapidly evolving health care landscape, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. The future is in value-based and patients center care, which is exactly the top of care that our independent pharmacy customers excel at providing. The future will also demand the seamless integration of technology and personalized service. And our latest offerings in this areas will enable our independent customers to be on the forefront of this evolution in pharmacy case. We have deployed new offerings that streamline pharmacy operations and reimbursement activities. In addition, we are providing innovative tools that simultaneously enrich the patient's experience while improving the pharmacy's efficiency.
Finally, we stand beside all our customers and the patients they serve as we advocate our with state and legislators and regulators. Our primary work in Washington is to ensure that our customers receive a fair share of the health care dollar amidst increasing pressure on costs from all payer segments in an increasingly transparent and demanding environment. In a total political environment, it is very important to remain engaged to ensure adequate reimbursement and to preserve patient exits to care.
Before I move on, I want to take the moment to recognize a great colleague and to thank Dave Neu, as he retires from AmerisourceBergen after 34 years of extraordinary service to the company in our retail pharmacy customers. Dave started his career as a truck driver and rose through the ranks to become the Head of Our Direct Company before ending his career as the President of Good Neighbor Pharmacy. Dave's vision and customer-centric philosophy helped make ABC a true leader and his dedication to excellence and to mentoring the next generation of leaders will be sorely missed. 
We are excited that Brett Nightingale has ably stepped into the leading role in our retail sales operations and Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. Brian is a pharmacist and came to ABC as the co-founder of Xcenda, one of our market-leading consulting businesses. Like so many of our leaders, Brian elected to stay with the company after the acquisition of Xcenda because he believes in the vision and the people of ABC. As the business, he brings an entrepreneurial spirit to GNP, as well as deep experience in specialty, manufacture services and value-based care. I am very excited about Brian's unique fit for this role and it was awesome to see him already deep engage with customers last week at our trade show.
As I mentioned earlier, we renewed our long-standing relationship with Kaiser Permanente for additional 5 years. We are very pleased that this premier health care system has chosen to remain our partner, and we look forward to continuing our history of innovation focused on the Kaiser Permanente members. 
During the quarter, we made steady progress in our efforts to evolve our customer's pricing strategy on brand and Specialty Products to better effect change in market conditions. Every conversation we are having with our customers regarding contracts and renewals has great this challenge, and we are pleased that our customers are not only receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher price brand and Specialty Products, but are open to finding workable solutions.
ABDC will continue to face occasional headwinds as we renew customers in the ordinary course of time. But we believe that so many key customers are signed on to long-term contracts. 
PharMEDium, which of course, is now part of ABDC, had a great quarter. The integration of PharMEDium had been seamless and their performance had exceeded our expectations. Our hospital customers had proven to be a receptive to the products and services that PharMEDium provides, and the scale of quality of their compounded, there up operation is a primary driver in the ability to earn new business. Bob Marsh and I visited PharMEDium a few weeks ago, and I'm very pleased about the quality-based innovative approach they are taking to ensure ever higher standards of efficiency and safety while working in a demanding regulatory environment. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, and I'm very excited about the future potential of this business.
As I conclude my comments on our drug company, I want to say a few words about drug processing. Drug processing trends in the quarter on both branded and generic products were in line with our expectations, though some of the brand increases came earlier than expected. Generic deflation a quarter was also in line with our expectations. Content focus on the cost of both traditional and specialty pharmaceutical care will persist with drug price and will come from different venues. But in the efforts to manage inexpensive health care, we must not sacrifice patient exit to care. AmerisourceBergen is increasing the partner of choice for manufacturers and health care providers alike who are working to demonstrate the immense value inherent in many patient therapies and the life-changing impacts they have on patients in the health card accounts. Our ability to work collaboratively across the entire health care spectrum to preserve patient actives enable us to be an attractive partner in a rapidly changing marketplace.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, which is long championed patient active to Specialty Products, once again had a strong quarter with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. 
As I explained last quarter, the economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which of the product is administered or dispensed. Whether the product is by the medical or pharmacy benefits in the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by a physician that is treating a patient in a community setting because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
As we have discussed before, a unique position in specialty sets us up well to be a future leader in biosimilars. While we haven't seen many launches yet, we are pleased to see some promising developments around FDA panel approvals of biosimilars. 
The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a valuable partner in nearly every aspect of bringing the product to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting our commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the market for biosimilars. 
Taken individually, our specialty group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is our oncology franchise, our plasma lysine position office distribution businesses or our third-party logistics business. Taken together, the Specialty Group is the undisputed in neighboring specialty product success in this of essential partner for manufacturers will provide it and ultimately, for the patient they serve. This portfolio of offerings we have both will only become more important as biosimilars come to market and personalize medicines become more prevalent because all of these innovations will take place in an environment that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency.
In addition, just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists than in specialty physicians who are caring for some of the sickest patients. I've been working with community physicians for more than 20 years, and I have always been inspired by the way they care for their patients. The cost to administer of products and to care for these patients are significant and the risks associated with disruptions and care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms on Part B drugs. And we'll do stay a way that keep patients well fed Paramounts.
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a solid new [ph] quarter. Our expertise and a balding patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in a regulatory compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators for ABC. The increasingly global, which we have establish in the area was to further expand our value propositions to manufacturers, especially Canada, Western Europe and Brazil. 
Our best-in-class Consulting Services within Lash Group performed well in the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform would unlock new possibilities for growth by driving internal efficiencies and expanding our capability to provide custom tailored programs and services to our manufacture customers. 
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC and his team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in this premium logistics, particularly support of clinical trials. World Courier recently launched the Cocoon, a new transport service that utilizes innovative packaging for temperature sensitive materials. Cocoon offers powerful combination of lower rate and proven high-performance that is emanate did need to sacrifice quality for cost. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform, limitations also going well and above picture they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. I'm especially pleased with the strong results they continue to deliver. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business with organic growth, new innovative product introduction and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI's private label generics program, Net 1, is also growing above market as an add additional products to its portfolio and is achieving increased penetration.
We continue to discover way in which MWI enhances ABC and then the addition of MWI has added a new perspective and I mentioned, jump pharmaceutical, manufacturer relationships. We have learned a lot from one another, especially in sourcing and supply chain activities with the best practices on both the human and animal health side of the business, while even more complementary than we first envisioned. The MWI team has also been working closely with ABDC's warehouse punishment experts to identify areas where we can rise scale efficiencies and implement best practices. These collaborative efforts have been very successful, and I applaud our team will be open to innovation on both sides. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. It is an area, which we will continue to invest in as we have only just begun to read the 4 set of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Looking ahead, as we noted in the press release, we now expect our adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.32 to $5.37, an increase of 11% to 12% over fiscal year '15. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year and to have completed 350 million in share repurchases for fiscal year-end. We have also reiterated the preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 that we gave last quarter, which includes adjusted EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6% on revenue growth in line with the market. Tim will provide additional details on our working assumptions. But keep in mind that we are still in our planning process and will provide our full guide in the early November. 
Over the longer term, we would expect to be able to grow revenues slightly above the market, grow gross profits slightly slower than revenues among drive some operating leverage, generate free cash flow approximately 125% of net income and benefit from the balance redeployment of capital, including both strategic and synergistic M&A and share repurchases. Ultimately, our aspirational goal is to achieve adjusted EPS growth in the midteens.
In summary and in conclusion, I continue to have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen future. The strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated assets is a compelling value proposition for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our seasoned management team shares my passion and drive for producing excellent results while also delivering outstanding customer service. Our dedication to continuous improvement in the quality of our offerings, our associate's track record of seamless execution, our financial performance and our fruitful capital management all help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
Now I will turn it over to Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. I would ask that you refer to our press release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results.
Please note that all financial comparisons are made for this morning are for the third quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. I have 3 primary areas to cover this morning. First, I will recap our fiscal Q3 consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 [ph] expectations. And third, I will provide updated commentary on fiscal '17. With that, we begin our third quarter review.
Revenues were $36.9 billion, up 8%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for almost all of our revenue growth. As a reminder, included in the segment is our PharMEDium acquisition. They accounted for relatively small part of our overall ABC revenue increase. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment accounted for roughly 80% of our gross profit dollar growth with PharMEDium being a key contributor to this growth. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 4% to $574 million. Last quarter, we mentioned on our call that we are focused on expenses and ensuring we spend it in the right areas. We believe we made good progress in this area in the June quarter.
Looking forward to our fourth quarter, please keep in mind that we typically have a seasonal increase in our operating expenses, primarily around payroll and compensation. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $493 million, up $38 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, a 1 basis point improvement. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 32.8% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. As highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated the lower tax rate due to the growth in our international businesses. We continue to expect that our full year tax rate will be roughly 33%.
As a reminder, this tax rate is durable as long as our mix of U.S. to international business stays at its current level. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $1.37, driven mostly by the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and to a lesser degree, from our lower effective tax rate. 
Our adjusted diluted share count was just under 229 million shares, down about 1% from last year. Let me highlight that in this quarter, we did have a positive EPS contribution of a few pennies from 2 items. First item, we had 2 earlier-than-expected brand manufacturer price increases coming in June versus July. And the second item, we had some expense savings of that came faster than anticipated and exceeded our expectations.
Turning now to our third quarter segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.4 billion, up a very solid 8%. Our drug company had a growth rate of 6.5%. This growth was after a revenue headwinds of roughly 1.5% due to lower hepatitis C sales. The drug company had solid growth across several customer segments, including Walgreens, which grew at approximately 7%. Additionally, PharMEDium had another solid quarter of excellent unit volume growth, which drove a very good top line revenue increase for their business.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had their highest revenue growth rate this year with revenue increasing about 20%, driven mostly by volume. ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for 5% of specialty 20% revenue growth, due primarily to a new manufacturer relationship that started late last fiscal year. We also continued to realize meaningful revenue growth for the sale of oncology drugs across the few of our businesses and to a lesser degree, for the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, up $49 million or 7%. The increase in gross profit dollars was split somewhat evenly between the drug company and ABSG. Our drug company's increase was mostly from PharMEDium, which performed better than expected.
Segment operating income was $411 million and was up 9%. The growth was the direct results of higher revenues and the corresponding income contribution, combined with tight expense management. 
Overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making into this segment, and we're especially pleased with the performance of our ABSG specialty business.
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI Consulting Services and World Courier. In the June quarter, segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 3%. The segment had a revenue headwind of a few percentage points from a piece of business that moved from our TheraCom this tradition business back to the manufacturer.
Growth rates in our core Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI businesses, were all in line with what we expected. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well with percentage revenue growth in the companion animal segment in the high single-digits. On the production animal side of the business, revenue growth was still a little low, but we're very encouraged based on capital market trends that growth traits will pick up as we move into late summer and fall. From an operating income standpoint, the segment had operating income of $83 million, up 7%, driven primarily from MWI and our World Courier businesses. Turning next to working capital and cash flow items.
In the June quarter, we had modest free cash flow generation when compared to our 2 previous quarters this fiscal year. The lower cash generation was due to a sizable impact from timing, unfavorable working capital in the June quarter that reversed during the first week of July. Additionally, free cash was also impacted from the extra working capital investment we made with Walgreens. I should remind everyone that this working capital investment will continue to be phased-in over the next few quarters. 
At June 30, we had $1.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet. This includes $470 million offshore related primarily to our Switzerland and World Courier businesses. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization.
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. Before I cover our specific guidance measures, let me just make a few brief comments on the drug pricing environment in addition to what Steve discussed earlier, starting with generics. 
Our generic portfolio or a basket of generic drugs through July, as expected, deflated in a high single-digit range. Let me highlight that our deflation rate is calculated using our specific sales mix and inventory levels for our fiscal year other than the supply chain, they calculate their indexes differently or likely will have a slightly different deflation rate because of their unique mix of business. 
While there are several market factors that can impact our forward-looking assumption based on what we know today, we expect that our generic deflation rate will remain where it is currently through the end of our fiscal year September 30. 
Switching to branded drugs. The month of July has certainly, been the pair a return to see a number of brand drug price increases. This current July was not an exception. The number of increases that rates of increase are mostly in line with what we expected except for the 2 manufacturers that announced their price increases earlier than expected in June. 
We can now move to our updated fiscal '16 P&L guidance. Adjusted EPS, as we enter our fourth quarter, as a reminder, new pricing for the Kaiser renewal took effect on July 1. Our EPS guidance range is now $5.52 to $5.57, which is growth of 11% to 12% versus last fiscal year. Free cash flow, we still expect to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And for share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase about $350 million for the full year.
The final topic I want to cover this morning is a commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Even though we are in the middle of our planning process, we are still comfortable with the preliminary guidance we gave last quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS. We expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the mid-point of our updated fiscal '16 guidance range. In our press release that we should this mining, we listed our key assumptions related to our preliminary fiscal '17 guidance. But there are 3 specific guidance assumptions I would like to highlight on our call.
Number one, generic pricing. As mentioned earlier, the trends haven't changed from what we previously expected. Our working assumption for fiscal '17 is that generic deflation remains in high single-digit range. Number two, the Medicare Part D demonstration project and the impact to our specialty business. With a lack of clarity on what, if anything, gets implemented and importantly, the timing. It's just too early to estimate the impact to our business.
And number three, the new accounting rules regarding share based compensation. While it's likely we will early adopt the accounting rule in our fiscal '17, our guidance range does not contemplate the impact from an implementation. Most of our share based compensation is weighted toward stock options. This makes forecasting the tax benefit more challenging because it's difficult to predict when the employee will exercise and importantly, the ABC share price at the time of exercise. Our current thinking is that the EPS impact will likely be modest.
As I wrap up my comments, overall, we are pleased with our results this quarter. As we move into our fourth fiscal quarter, we believe we're gaining traction in our core drug business. Our ABSG specialty business continues to have good momentum. And MWI and PharMEDium, our most recent acquisitions, are performing very well. As always, we thank you for your interest in ABC. Let me now turn it over to Barbara to start the Q&A."

But again, I want to stress that that's what we expected across our portfolio and our portfolio is unique to ABC. I still think that, and Steve can jump in, that we can navigate through that deflation. And we feel like it's still -- this is one aspect of how we make money on generics."

So it's -- one thing that may not have been admitted evident is we're just getting so much granular about the business. I mean, we talked about oncology business, I don't know if you noticed in my script, I said in all different sides of care, even within specialty. So you've got increasing our oncology business and we've got an increasing hospital business, which often gets done through ASD, as well as our traditional Oncology Supply Island businesses. So there is just a lot of granularity and this is the first time we really started measuring what we do in oncology, which is only in our specialty business. And we do a lot of oncology, by the way, of course, in our health system business within drug, which is a really strong franchise for us also. 
But on the manufacturers side, the manufacturers are increasingly looking at specialty at the different business and they're looking at what components of the fee-for-service agreements do they want to see in most specialty-oriented product. And those are traditional established manufacturers, the Lilys and prices and of the world, as well as the more traditional specialty manufacturers that you associate with biotech products and specialty products. So these people service agreements we have at manufacturers are becoming more nuance, and we expect that to continue. And that's why I'm pleased that the basin health leadership we've got really strong customer-focused, manufacture focused team that focuses on access and sites of delivery as well as the economics of these products. And we -- I think we're managing through this very well. Almost every customer that we speak to understands the strengths. When really and the contracting side, the comments last quarter were probably more of the provider changing pricing environment as supposed a manufacturer changes with these chance have been well understood. And we're more in constant fee-for-service negotiation discussion with manufacturers finish in addition as opposed to say Kaiser, which a 5 or 7-year contract. 7-year is well, 5 years this time, and it's a very intimate and contracting opportunity. So those are really, I hope that's all clear because it is very fluid and nuanced."

But overall, I think ABC has really taken -- you may be surprised of this, but most impression you generally have. Their technology enabled approach. So I think when you look at the start of absent we have, we have this technology and innovation center, our trade show last week. I was there right when it opened because I was getting a preview of all the different offerings we had. So we had this virtual reality experience tapping counter where we showed the history, but also what the future pharmacy could be like. And it was just large to see that. Some of the absent we have. The ABC order, we had 200 pharmacists that were involved in the development of that new interface, which is probably the way that our customers will be interfacing more and more there. So I think we're getting into a more digitally enabled Good Neighbor Pharmacy type environment. Bob Marsh talks a lot when I was with him, we met with customers, really about there's no reason that experience shouldn't be as rich as when you work with Amazon or one of these other primary e-commerce of size. And that's really what our goal is. And there was a lot of discussion on passport in the past. The generational ordering interface that we're replacing about the search feature. Now the search feature is going to be just better. I do want to go to too much granularity. But we're really proud of under the leadership of CIO and just strong IT presence throughout the business, where we're moving the technology for our customers. And we all measure success through projects sales, through enable pharmacy membership, to elevate participation, which is going extremely well. And I'm just pleased that we've got the ski a great tenants locked down in the can work on helping them grow. So it's an early quantity by those are the quarter. And we feel good and we think this outside there. I think we've maybe full impact of the same or 2%, and I think we hope to regain that.

I am pleased to report solid performance in our June quarter and good progress on the objectives for fiscal 2016 that we laid out in early May. Revenues were up nearly 8% and adjusted EPS was up 40%. 
Certain areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group also continued its strong performance in the June quarter. In AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, we renewed our distribution relationship with Kaiser Permanente for 5 years, and achieved the benefits of some expense reduction earlier than expected. With many of our large customer renewals now behind us, we feel really good about our market position in all of our key portfolio segments. While there's still work to be done, I am thrilled to commend our associates for their successful work and dedication in ensuring that we are well positioned as we approach the end of the fiscal year and look ahead towards next year.
As I have said many times, we are fortunate to play a key role in a vibrant industry and to have a stronghold in the U.S. market, which is still the best market in the world. U.S. organic sales growth continues to be strong and the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry dynamics remain competitive, but stable. In addition, we take great pride in our ability to increasingly meet the needs of our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners on a global scale and to use our extensive knowledge, reach and partnership philosophy to help our health care provider customers better serve their patients. 
Turning now to our performance in the quarter. Tim will provide the details, but I want to highlight some key items. I just returned from ThoughtSpot, our annual retail trade show in Las Vegas, where we hosted a record number of independent community pharmacy attendees. I was excited to see firsthand the enthusiasm with which our independent customers are embracing our new offerings. 
In Las Vegas, we renewed our long-standing commitment to community pharmacy, and we highlighted several resources we had been investing in to ensure our GNP stores remain successful. 
Our government advocacy resources include a new Internet site called ourindependentvoice.com, which provides pharmacists with a centralized place to access tools to drive advocacy movements and stay abreast of community and legislative developments. 
Our front end retail excellence programs helps our members optimize front end sales, take advantage of manufacturer promotions and make better use of point-of-sale data and reporting tools. We have also introduced ABC Order, our next-generation ordering platform that is specifically engineered to work within pharmacy workflow and will be available in 2017. 
While community providers certainly face challenges in the rapidly evolving health care landscape, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. The future is in value-based and patient-centered care, which is exactly the type of care that our independent pharmacy customers excel at providing. The future will also demand the seamless integration of technology and personalized service. And our latest offerings in these areas will enable our independent customers to be on the forefront of this evolution in pharmacy care. We have deployed new offerings that streamline pharmacy operations and reimbursement activities. In addition, we are providing innovative tools that simultaneously enrich the patient's experience while improving the pharmacy's efficiency.
Finally, we stand besides all our customers and the patients they serve as we advocate on their behalf with state and federal legislators and regulators. Our primary work in Washington is to ensure that our customers receive a fair share of the health care dollar amidst increasing pressure on costs from all payer segments in an increasingly transparent and demanding environment. In a tumultuous political environment, it is very important to remain engaged to ensure adequate reimbursement and to preserve patient access to care.
Before I move on, I want to take a moment to recognize a great colleague and to thank Dave Neu, as he retires from AmerisourceBergen after 34 years of extraordinary service to the company and our retail pharmacy customers. Dave started his career as a truck driver and rose through the ranks to become the Head of Our Direct Company before ending his career as the President of Good Neighbor Pharmacy. Dave's vision and customer-centric philosophy helped make ABC a true leader and his dedication to excellence and to mentoring the next generation of leaders will be sorely missed. 
We are excited that Brian Nightengale has ably stepped into the leading role in our retail sales operations and Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. Brian is a pharmacist and came to ABC as the co-founder of Xcenda, one of our market-leading consulting businesses. Like so many of our leaders, Brian elected to stay with the company after the acquisition of Xcenda because he believes in the vision and the people of ABC. As a business founder, he brings an entrepreneurial spirit to GNP, as well as deep experience in specialty, manufacturer services and value-based care. I am very excited about Brian's unique fit for this role and it was awesome to see him already deeply engaged with customers last week at our trade show.
As I mentioned earlier, we renewed our long-standing relationship with Kaiser Permanente for an additional 5 years. We are very pleased that this premier health care system has chosen to remain our partner, and we look forward to continuing our history of innovation focused on the Kaiser Permanente members. 
During the quarter, we made steady progress in our efforts to evolve our customer's pricing strategy on brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. Every conversation we are having with our customers regarding contracts and renewals, as great as this challenge, and we are pleased that our customers are not only receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher price brand and specialty products, but are open to finding workable solutions.
ABDC will continue to face occasional headwinds as we renew customers in the ordinary course of time. But we are pleased that so many key customers are signed on to long-term contracts. 
PharMEDium, which of course is now part of ABDC, had a great quarter. The integration of PharMEDium had been seamless and their performance had exceeded our expectations. Our hospital customers have proven to be receptive to the products and services that PharMEDium provides, and the scale and quality of their compounded, sterile preparations is a primary driver in the ability to earn new business. Bob Mauch and I visited PharMEDium a few weeks ago, and I'm really pleased about the quality-based innovative approach they are taking to ensure ever higher standards of efficiency and safety while working in a demanding regulatory environment. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, and I am very excited about the future potential of this business.
As I conclude my comments on our drug company, I want to say a few words about drug pricing. Drug pricing trends in the quarter on both branded and generic products were in line with our expectations, though some of the brand increases came earlier than expected. Generic deflation in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. The intense focus on the cost of both traditional and specialty pharmaceutical care will persist for some time, and will come from different venues. But in the efforts to manage the expense of health care, we must not sacrifice patient access to care. AmerisourceBergen is increasingly the partner of choice for manufacturers and health care providers alike, who are working to demonstrate the immense value inherent in many patient therapies and the life-changing impacts they have on patients and their health card accounts. Our ability to work collaboratively across the entire health care spectrum to preserve patient access enables us to be an attractive partner in a rapidly changing marketplace.
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group, which has long championed patient access to specialty products, once again had a strong quarter with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. 
As I explained last quarter, the economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which of the product is administered or dispensed. Whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefits, and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by a physician that is treating a patient in a community setting, because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
As we have discussed before, our unique position in specialty sets us up well to be a future leader in biosimilars. While we haven't seen many launches yet, we are pleased to see some promising developments around FDA panel approvals of biosimilars. 
The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a valuable partner in nearly every aspect of bringing the product to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics, to consulting our commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the market for biosimilars. 
Taken individually, our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is our oncology franchise, our plasma, vaccine and position office distribution businesses or our third-party logistics business. Taken together, the Specialty Group is the undisputed leader enabling Specialty Product's success and is the essential partner for manufacturers or providers and ultimately, for the patients they serve. This portfolio of offerings we have both will only become more important as biosimilars come to market and personalized medicine becomes more prevalent, because all of these innovations will take place in an environment that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency.
In addition, just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians who are caring for some of the sickest patients. I've been working with community physicians for more than 20 years, and I have always been inspired by the way they care for their patients. The cost to administer the product, and to care for these patients are significant, and the risk associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms on Part B drugs. And will do so in a way that keeps patient welfare paramount. 
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators for ABC. The increasingly global reach we have established in this area, also further expands our value propositions to manufacturers, especially Canada, Western Europe and Brazil. 
Our best-in-class Consulting Services within Lash Group performed well in the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform would unlock new possibilities for growth by driving internal efficiencies and expanding our capability to provide custom tailored programs and services to our manufacture customers. 
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly support of clinical trials. World Courier recently launched Cocoon, a new transport service that utilizes innovative packaging for temperature-sensitive materials. Cocoon offers a powerful combination of lower weight and proven higher performance that eliminates the need to sacrifice quality for cost. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implmentation is also going well, and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. I'm especially pleased with the strong results they continue to deliver. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business with organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains, all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI's private label generics program, Vet One, is also growing above market as it adds additional products to its portfolio and is achieving increased penetration.
We continue to discover ways in which MWI enhances ABC and the addition of MWI has added a new perspective and dimension to our pharmaceutical manufacturer relationships. We have learned a lot from one another, especially in sourcing and supply chain activities, where the best practices on both the human and animal health side of the business, were even more complementary than we first envisioned. The MWI team has also been working closely with ABDC's warehouse management experts to identify areas where we can drive scale efficiencies and implement best practices. These collaborative efforts have been very successful, and I applaud our team for being open to innovation on both sides. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. It is an area which we will continue to invest in as we have only just begun to realize the full set of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Looking ahead, as we noted in the press release, we now expect our adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, an increase of 11% to 12% over fiscal year '15. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year and to have completed $350 million in share repurchases by vertical year-end. We have also reiterated the preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 that we gave last quarter, which includes adjusted EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6%, on revenue growth in line with the market. Tim will provide additional details on our working assumptions. But keep in mind that we are still in our planning process and will provide our full guidance in early November. 
Over the longer term, we would expect to be able to grow revenues slightly above the market, grow gross profits slightly slower than revenues, drive some operating leverage, generate free cash flow at approximately 125% of net income and benefit from the balanced redeployment of capital, including both strategic and synergistic M&A and share repurchases. Ultimately, our aspirational goal is to achieve adjusted EPS growth in the midteens.
In summary and in conclusion, I continue to have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. The strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated assets is a compelling value proposition for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our seasoned management team shares my passion and drive for producing excellent results while also delivering outstanding customer service. Our dedication to continuous improvement and the quality of our offerings, our associates' track record of seamless execution, our financial performance and our thoughtful capital management all help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
Now, I will turn it over to Tim."

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. I would ask that you refer to our press release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results.
Please note that all financial comparisons I make this morning are for the third quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. I have 3 primary areas to cover this morning: first, I will recap our fiscal Q3 consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations; and third, I will provide updated commentary on fiscal '17. With that, we can begin our third quarter review.
Revenues were $36.9 billion, up 8%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for almost all of our revenue growth. As a reminder, included in the segment is our PharMEDium acquisition. They accounted for a relatively small part of our overall ABC revenue increase. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment accounted for roughly 80% of our gross profit dollar growth, with PharMEDium being a key contributor to this growth. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 4% to $574 million. Last quarter, we mentioned on our call that we are focused on expenses and ensuring we spend in the right areas. We believe we made good progress in this area in the June quarter.
Looking forward to our fourth quarter, please keep in mind that we typically have a seasonal increase in our operating expenses, primarily around payroll and compensation. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $493 million, up $38 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, a 1 basis point improvement. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 32.8% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. As highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated a lower tax rate due to the growth in our international businesses. We continue to expect that our full year tax rate will be roughly 33%.
As a reminder, this tax rate is durable as long as our mix of U.S. to international business stays at its current level. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $1.37, driven mostly by the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and to a lesser degree, from our lower effective tax rate. 
Our adjusted diluted share count was just under 229 million shares, down about 1% from last year. Let me highlight that in this quarter, we did have a positive EPS contribution of a few pennies from 2 items: the first item, we had 2 earlier-than-expected brand manufacturer price increases, coming in June versus July; and the second item, we had some expense savings that came faster than anticipated and exceeded our expectations.
Turning now to our third quarter segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.4 billion, up a very solid 8%. Our Drug Company had a growth rate of 6.5%. This growth was after a revenue headwind of roughly 1.5% due to lower hepatitis C sales. The Drug Company had solid growth across several customer segments, including Walgreens, which grew at approximately 7%. Additionally, PharMEDium had another quarter of excellent unit volume growth, which drove a very good top line revenue increase for their business.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had their highest revenue growth rate this year, with revenue increasing about 20%, driven mostly by volume. ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for 5% of specialty's 20% revenue growth, due primarily to a new manufacturer relationship that started late last fiscal year. We also continued to realize meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across the few of our businesses and to a lesser degree, from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, up $49 million or 7%. The increase in gross profit dollars was split somewhat evenly between the Drug Company and ABSG. Our Drug Company's increase was mostly from PharMEDium, which performed better than expected.
Segment operating income was $411 million and was up 9%. The growth was the direct result of higher revenues and the corresponding income contribution, combined with tight expense management. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we're making in this segment, and we are especially pleased with the performance of our ABSG specialty business.
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI, Consulting Services and World Courier. In the June quarter, segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 3%. The segment had a revenue headwind of a few percentage points from a piece of business that moved from our TheraCom distribution business back to the manufacturer.
Growth rates in our core Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI businesses, were all in line with what we expected. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well, with percentage revenue growth in the companion animal segment in the high single-digits. On the production animal side of the business, revenue growth was still a little low, but we are very encouraged based on capital market trends that growth traits will pick up as we move into late summer and fall. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $83 million, up 7%, driven primarily from MWI and our World Courier businesses. Turning next to working capital and cash flow items.
In the June quarter, we had modest free cash flow generation when compared to our 2 previous quarters this fiscal year. The lower cash generation was due to a sizable impact from timing, unfavorable working capital in the June quarter that reversed during the first week of July. Additionally, free cash was also impacted from the extra working capital investment we made with Walgreens. I should remind everyone that this working capital investment will continue to be phased-in over the next few quarters. 
At June 30, we had $1.9 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes $470 million offshore, related primarily to our Switzerland and World Courier businesses. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization.
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. Before I cover our specific guidance measures, let me just make a few brief comments on the drug pricing environment, in addition to what Steve discussed earlier, starting with generics. 
Our generic portfolio, or basket of generic drugs, through July as expected, deflated in a high single-digit range. Let me highlight that our deflation rate is calculated using our specific sales mix and inventory levels for our fiscal year. Other than the supply chain, they calculate their indexes differently or likely, will have a slightly different deflation rate because of their unique mix of business. 
While there are several market factors that can impact our forward-looking assumption based on what we know today, we expect that our generic deflation rate will remain where it is currently through the end of our fiscal year September 30. 
Switching to branded drugs. The month of July has historically been a period where we tend to see a number of brand drug price increases. This current July was not an exception. The number of increases that rates of increase were are mostly in line with what we expected, except for the 2 manufacturers that announced their price increases earlier than expected in June. 
We can now move to our updated fiscal '16 P&L guidance. Adjusted EPS, as we enter our fourth quarter, as a reminder, new pricing for the Kaiser renewal took effect on July 1. Our EPS guidance range is now $5.52 to $5.57, which is growth of 11% to 12% versus last fiscal year. Free cash flow, we still expect to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And for share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase about $350 million for the full year.
The final topic I want to cover this morning is a commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Even though we are in the middle of our planning process, we are still comfortable with the preliminary guidance we gave last quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS. We expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the mid-point of our updated fiscal '16 guidance range. In our press release that we should this mining, we listed our key assumptions related to our preliminary fiscal '17 guidance. But there are 3 specific guidance assumptions I would like to highlight on our call.
Number 1, generic pricing. As mentioned earlier, the trends haven't changed from what we previously expected. Our working assumption for fiscal '17 is that generic deflation remains in the high single-digit range. Number 2, the Medicare Part B demonstration project and the impact to our specialty business. With a lack of clarity on what, if anything, gets implemented and importantly, the timing, it's just too early to estimate the impact to our business.
And #3, the new accounting rules regarding share based compensation. While it's likely we will early adopt the new accounting rule in our fiscal '17, our guidance range does not contemplate the impact from an implementation. Most of our share based compensation is weighted towards stock options. This makes forecasting the tax benefit more challenging, because it's difficult to predict when the employee will exercise and importantly, the ABC share price at the time of exercise. Our current thinking is that the EPS impact will likely be modest.
As I wrap up my comments, overall, we are pleased with our results this quarter. As we move into our fourth fiscal quarter, we believe we're gaining traction in our core drug business. Our ABSG specialty business continues to have good momentum. And MWI and PharMEDium, our most recent acquisitions, are performing very well. As always, we thank you for your interest in ABC.

So it's -- one thing that may not have been immediately evident is, when we -- we're just getting so much granular about the business. And when we talked about our oncology business, I don't know if you noticed in my script, I said, in all different sites of care, even within specialty. So we've got an increasing oral oncology business, and we've got an increasing hospital business, which often gets done through ASD, as well as our traditional Oncology Supply ION businesses. So there is just a lot of granularity, and this is the first time we've really started measuring what we do in oncology, not just only in our specialty business. And we do a lot of oncology, by the way, of course, in our health system business within drug, which is a really strong franchise for us also. 
But on the manufacturers side, the manufacturers are increasingly looking at specialty at a different business, and they're looking at what components of the fee-for-service agreement do they want to see in a more specialty-oriented product. And those are traditional, established manufacturers, the Lilys and Pfizers and Mercks of the world, as well as the more traditional specialty manufacturers that you associate with biotech products and specialty products. So these fee-for-service agreements we have with manufacturers are becoming more nuanced, and we expect that to continue. And that's why I'm pleased that the Peyton Howell leadership we've got, a really strong customer-focused, and manufacturer-focused team that focuses on access and sites of delivery, as well as the economics of these products. And we -- I think we're managing through this very well. Almost every customer that we speak to understands these trends. When really, on the contracting side, the comments last quarter were probably more on the provider changing pricing environment as supposed to manufacturer changes where these trends have been well understood. And we're more in constant fee-for-service negotiation discussions with manufacturers, the next generation, as opposed to say Kaiser, which a 5 or 7-year contract. 7-years is well, 5 years this time, and it's a very intimate and contracting opportunity. So those are really, I hope that's all clear, because it is very fluid and nuanced."

But overall, I think ABC has really taken -- you may be surprised with this, but it's not the impression you generally have, a very technology-enabled approach. So I think when you look at the sort of asset we had, we had this technology and innovation center at our trade show last week. I was there right when it opened, because I was getting a preview of all the different offerings we had. So we had this virtual reality experience, a topic counter where we showed the history, but also what the future of pharmacy could be like. And it would just large [ph] to see that. Some of the apps that we have. The ABC order, we had 200 pharmacists that were involved in the development of that new interface, which is probably the way that our customers will be interfacing more and more today. So I think we're getting into a more digitally enabled Good Neighbor Pharmacy type environment. Bob Mauch talks a lot. When I was with him, we met with customers, really about there's no reason that experience shouldn't be as rich as when you work with Amazon or one of these other primary e-commerce sites. And that's really what our goal is. And there was a lot of discussion on passport in the past. The generation of ordering interface that we're replacing about the search feature. Now the search feature's going to be just better. Not wanting to get into too much granularity, but we're really proud of, under the leadership of CIO and just strong IT presence throughout the business, where we're moving the technology for our customers. And we all measure success through project sales, through just Good Neighbor Pharmacy membership. To elevate participation, which is going extremely well, And I'm just pleased that we've got these key anchor tenants locked down, and we can work on helping them grow. So it's a lot early to quantity, and those are quality, and we feel good and we think there's upside there. I think we've, maybe forward and back a percent or two, and I think we hope to regain that.

In fact, overall, the best returns we've had have been capital investments. But I've been -- this is actually my 21st quarter, and I'm really proud of the 3 big acquisitions we've made. They've worked out so well strategically, operationally, financially, and truly helped drive that overall portfolio a bit. But you know, we've done a terrific amount of share buybacks. And I'm also really proud that we've completely hedged the warrant. So we've done a lot in all these different areas. And we do always evaluate any acquisition against our share buyback. But in the long run, they tend to add some intangibles and some long-term benefits to the portfolio and the value that we bring to manufacturers, to providers, to patients that, if they thoughtfully done this, it's really -- is an excellent use of capital, along with some great internal projects, like we talked about the ABC order, the national replenishment center, many investments that we made in our oncology protocol, analyzer products like that, that are just, terrific benefit to the customers and really, essentially make us much more relevant and sticky for the customers.

I am pleased to report solid performance in our June quarter and good progress on the objectives for fiscal 2016 that we laid out in early May. Revenues were up nearly 8% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. 
Certain areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group also continued its strong performance in the June quarter. In AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, we renewed our distribution relationship with Kaiser Permanente for 5 years, and achieved the benefits of some expense reduction earlier than expected. With many of our large customer renewals now behind us, we feel really good about our market position in all of our key portfolio segments. While there's still work to be done, I am thrilled to commend our associates for their successful work and dedication in ensuring that we are well positioned as we approach the end of the fiscal year and look ahead towards next year.
As I have said many times, we are fortunate to play a key role in a vibrant industry and to have a stronghold in the U.S. market, which is still the best market in the world. U.S. organic sales growth continues to be strong and the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry dynamics remain competitive, but stable. In addition, we take great pride in our ability to increasingly meet the needs of our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners on a global scale and to use our extensive knowledge, reach and partnership philosophy to help our health care provider customers better serve their patients. 
Turning now to our performance in the quarter. Tim will provide the details, but I want to highlight some key items. I just returned from ThoughtSpot, our annual retail trade show in Las Vegas, where we hosted a record number of independent community pharmacy attendees. I was excited to see firsthand the enthusiasm with which our independent customers are embracing our new offerings. 
In Las Vegas, we renewed our long-standing commitment to community pharmacy, and we highlighted several resources we had been investing in to ensure our GNP stores remain successful. 
Our government advocacy resources include a new Internet site called ourindependentvoice.com, which provides pharmacists with a centralized place to access tools to drive advocacy movements and stay abreast of community and legislative developments. 
Our front end retail excellence programs helps our members optimize front end sales, take advantage of manufacturer promotions and make better use of point-of-sale data and reporting tools. We have also introduced ABC Order, our next-generation ordering platform that is specifically engineered to work within pharmacy workflow and will be available in 2017. 
While community providers certainly face challenges in the rapidly evolving health care landscape, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacies. The future is in value-based and patient-centered care, which is exactly the type of care that our independent pharmacy customers excel at providing. The future will also demand the seamless integration of technology and personalized service. And our latest offerings in these areas will enable our independent customers to be on the forefront of this evolution in pharmacy care. We have deployed new offerings that streamline pharmacy operations and reimbursement activities. In addition, we are providing innovative tools that simultaneously enrich the patient's experience while improving the pharmacy's efficiency.
Finally, we stand beside all our customers and the patients they serve as we advocate on their behalf with state and federal legislators and regulators. Our primary work in Washington is to ensure that our customers receive a fair share of the health care dollar amidst increasing pressure on costs from all payer segments and an increasingly transparent and demanding environment. In a tumultuous political environment, it is very important to remain engaged to ensure adequate reimbursement and to preserve patient access to care.
Before I move on, I want to take a moment to recognize a great colleague and to thank Dave Neu, as he retires from AmerisourceBergen after 34 years of extraordinary service to the company and our retail pharmacy customers. Dave started his career as a truck driver and rose through the ranks to become the Head of Our Direct Company before ending his career as the President of Good Neighbor Pharmacy. Dave's vision and customer-centric philosophy helped make ABC a true leader and his dedication to excellence and to mentoring the next generation of leaders will be sorely missed. 
We are excited that Brian Nightengale has ably stepped into the leading role in our retail sales operations and Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. Brian is a pharmacist and came to ABC as the co-founder of Xcenda, one of our market-leading consulting businesses. Like so many of our leaders, Brian elected to stay with the company after the acquisition of Xcenda because he believes in the vision and the people of ABC. As a business founder, he brings an entrepreneurial spirit to GNP, as well as deep experience in specialty, manufacturer services and value-based care. I am very excited about Brian's unique fit for this role and it was awesome to see him already deeply engaged with customers last week at our trade show.
As I mentioned earlier, we renewed our long-standing relationship with Kaiser Permanente for an additional 5 years. We are very pleased that this premier health care system has chosen to remain our partner, and we look forward to continuing our history of innovation focused on the Kaiser Permanente members. 
During the quarter, we made steady progress in our efforts to evolve our customer's pricing strategy on brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. Every conversation we are having with our customers regarding contracts and renewals, as great is this challenge, and we are pleased that our customers are not only receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher price brand and specialty products, but are open to finding workable solutions.
ABDC will continue to face occasional headwinds as we renew customers in the ordinary course of time. But we are pleased that so many key customers are signed on to long-term contracts. 
PharMEDium, which of course is now part of ABDC, had a great quarter. The integration of PharMEDium had been seamless and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our hospital customers have proven to be receptive to the products and services that PharMEDium provides, and the scale and quality of their compounded, sterile preparations is a primary driver in their ability to earn new business. Bob Mauch and I visited PharMEDium a few weeks ago, and I'm really pleased about the quality-based innovative approach they are taking to ensure ever higher standards of efficiency and safety while working in a demanding regulatory environment. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, and I am very excited about the future potential of this business.
As I conclude my comments on our drug company, I want to say a few words about drug pricing. Drug pricing trends in the quarter on both branded and generic products were in line with our expectations, though some of the brand increases came earlier than expected. Generic deflation in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. The intense focus on the cost of both traditional and specialty pharmaceutical care will persist for some time, and will come from different venues. But in the efforts to manage the expense of health care, we must not sacrifice patient access to care. AmerisourceBergen is increasingly the partner of choice for manufacturers and health care providers alike, who are working to demonstrate the immense value inherent in many patient therapies and the life-changing impacts they have on patients and their health outcomes. Our ability to work collaboratively across the entire health care spectrum to preserve patient access enables us to be an attractive partner in a rapidly changing marketplace.
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group, which has long championed patient access to specialty products, once again had a strong quarter with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. 
As I explained last quarter, the economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which of the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefits, and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by physicians that is treating a patient in a community setting, because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
As we have discussed before, our unique position in specialty, sets us up well to be a future leader in biosimilars. While we haven't seen many launches yet, we are pleased to see some promising developments around FDA panel approvals of biosimilars. 
The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a valuable partner in nearly every aspect of bringing the product to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics, to consulting our commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the market for biosimilars. 
Taken individually, our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is our oncology franchise, our plasma, vaccine and physician office distribution businesses or our third-party logistics business. Taken together, the Specialty Group is the undisputed leader enabling Specialty Product's success and is the essential partner for manufacturers, for providers and ultimately, for the patients they serve. This portfolio of offerings we have both will only become more important as biosimilars come to market and personalized medicine becomes more prevalent, because all of these innovations will take place in an environment that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency.
In addition, just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians who are caring for some of the sickest patients. I've been working with community physicians for more than 20 years, and I have always been inspired by the way they care for their patients. The cost to administer the product, and to care for these patients are significant, and the risk associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms on Part B drugs. And will do so in a way that keeps patient welfare paramount. 
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators for ABC. The increasingly global reach we have established in this area, also further expands our value propositions to manufacturers, especially Canada, Western Europe and Brazil. 
Our best-in-class Consulting Services within Lash Group performed well in the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform would unlock new possibilities for growth by driving internal efficiencies and expanding our capability to provide custom tailored programs and services to our manufacture customers. 
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier recently launched Cocoon, a new transport service that utilizes innovative packaging for temperature-sensitive materials. Cocoon offers a powerful combination of lower weight and proven higher performance that eliminates the need to sacrifice quality for cost. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well, and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. I'm especially pleased with the strong results they continue to deliver. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business with organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains, all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI's private label generics program, Vet One, is also growing above market as it adds additional products to its portfolio and is achieving increased penetration.
We continue to discover ways in which MWI enhances ABC and the addition of MWI has added a new perspective and dimension to our pharmaceutical manufacturer relationships. We have learned a lot from one another, especially in sourcing and supply chain activities, where the best practices on both the human and animal health side of the business, were even more complementary than we first envisioned. The MWI team has also been working closely with ABDC's warehouse management experts to identify areas where we can drive scale efficiencies and implement best practices. These collaborative efforts have been very successful, and I applaud our team for being open to innovation on both sides. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. It is an area which we will continue to invest in as we have only just begun to realize the full set of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Looking ahead, as we noted in the press release, we now expect our adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, an increase of 11% to 12% over fiscal year '15. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year and to have completed $350 million in share repurchases by fiscal year-end. We have also reiterated the preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 that we gave last quarter, which includes adjusted EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6%, on revenue growth in line with the market. Tim will provide additional details on our working assumptions. But keep in mind that we are still in our planning process and will provide our full guidance in early November. 
Over the longer term, we would expect to be able to grow revenues slightly above the market, grow gross profits slightly slower than revenues, drive some operating leverage, generate free cash flow at approximately 125% of net income and benefit from the balanced redeployment of capital, including both strategic and synergistic M&A and share repurchases. Ultimately, our aspirational goal is to achieve adjusted EPS growth in the mid-teens.
In summary and in conclusion, I continue to have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. The strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated assets is a compelling value proposition for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our seasoned management team shares my passion and drive for producing excellent results while also delivering outstanding customer service. Our dedication to continuous improvement and the quality of our offerings, our associates' track record of seamless execution, our financial performance and our thoughtful capital management all help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. I would ask that you refer to our press release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results.
Please note that all financial comparisons I make this morning are for the third quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. I have 3 primary areas to cover this morning: first, I will recap our fiscal Q3 consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations; and third, I will provide updated commentary on fiscal '17. With that, we can begin our third quarter review.
Revenues were $36.9 billion, up 8%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for almost all of our revenue growth. As a reminder, included in the segment is our PharMEDium acquisition. They accounted for a relatively small part of our overall ABC revenue increase. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment accounted for roughly 80% of our gross profit dollar growth, with PharMEDium being a key contributor to this growth. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 4% to $574 million. Last quarter, we mentioned on our call that we are focused on expenses and ensuring we spend in the right areas. We believe we made good progress in this area in the June quarter.
Looking forward to our fourth quarter, please keep in mind that we typically have a seasonal increase in our operating expenses, primarily around payroll and compensation. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $493 million, up $38 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, a 1 basis point improvement. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 32.8% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. As highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated a lower tax rate due to the growth in our international businesses. We continue to expect that our full year tax rate will be roughly 33%.
As a reminder, this tax rate is durable as long as our mix of U.S. to international business stays at its current level. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $1.37, driven mostly by the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and to a lesser degree, from our lower effective tax rate. 
Our adjusted diluted share count was just under 229 million shares, down about 1% from last year. Let me highlight that in this quarter, we did have a positive EPS contribution of a few pennies from 2 items. Thee first item, we had 2 earlier than expected brand manufacturer price increases, coming in June versus July. And the second item, we had some expense savings that came faster than anticipated and exceeded our expectations.
Turning now to our third quarter segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.4 billion, up a very solid 8%. Our Drug Company had a growth rate of 6.5%. This growth was after a revenue headwind of roughly 1.5% due to lower hepatitis C sales. The Drug Company had solid growth across several customer segments, including Walgreens, which grew at approximately 7%. Additionally, PharMEDium had another quarter of excellent unit volume growth, which drove a very good top line revenue increase for their business.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had their highest revenue growth rate this year, with revenue increasing about 20%, driven mostly by volume. ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for 5% of specialty's 20% revenue growth, due primarily to a new manufacturer relationship that started late last fiscal year. We also continued to realize meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across the few of our businesses and to a lesser degree, from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, up $49 million or 7%. The increase in gross profit dollars was split somewhat evenly between the Drug Company and ABSG. Our Drug Company's increase was mostly from PharMEDium, which performed better than expected.
Segment operating income was $411 million and was up 9%. The growth was the direct result of higher revenues and the corresponding income contribution, combined with tight expense management. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we're making in this segment, and we are especially pleased with the performance of our ABSG specialty business.
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI, Consulting Services and World Courier. In the June quarter, segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 3%. The segment had a revenue headwind of a few percentage points from a piece of business that moved from our TheraCom distribution business back to the manufacturer.
Growth rates in our core Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI businesses, were all in line with what we expected. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well, with percentage revenue growth in the companion animal segment in the high single-digits. On the production animal side of the business, revenue growth was still a little low, but we are very encouraged based on cattle market trends that growth rates will pick up as we move into late summer and fall. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $83 million, up 7%, driven primarily from MWI and our World Courier businesses. Turning next to working capital and cash flow items.
In the June quarter, we had modest free cash flow generation when compared to our 2 previous quarters this fiscal year. The lower cash generation was due to a sizable impact from timing, unfavorable working capital in the June quarter that reversed during the first week of July. Additionally, free cash was also impacted from the extra working capital investment we made with Walgreens. I should remind everyone that this working capital investment will continue to be phased-in over the next few quarters. 
At June 30, we had $1.9 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes $470 million offshore, related primarily to our Switzerland and World Courier businesses. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization.
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. Before I cover our specific guidance measures, let me just make a few brief comments on the drug pricing environment, in addition to what Steve discussed earlier, starting with generics. 
Our generic portfolio, or basket of generic drugs, through July as expected, deflated in a high single-digit range. Let me highlight that our deflation rate is calculated using our specific sales mix and inventory levels for our fiscal year. Other than the supply chain, they calculate their indexes differently. More likely, will have a slightly different deflation rate because of their unique mix of business. 
While there are several market factors that can impact our forward-looking assumption based on what we know today, we expect that our generic deflation rate will remain where it is currently through the end of our fiscal year September 30. 
Switching to branded drugs. The month of July has historically been a period where we tend to see a number of brand drug price increases. This current July was not an exception. The number of increases that rates of increase were are mostly in line with what we expected, except for the 2 manufacturers that announced their price increases earlier than expected in June. 
We can now move to our updated fiscal '16 P&L guidance. Adjusted EPS, as we enter our fourth quarter, as a reminder, new pricing for the Kaiser renewal took effect on July 1. Our EPS guidance range is now $5.52 to $5.57, which is growth of 11% to 12% versus last fiscal year. Free cash flow, we still expect to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And for share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase about $350 million for the full year.
The final topic I want to cover this morning is a commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Even though we are in the middle of our planning process, we are still comfortable with the preliminary guidance we gave last quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS. We expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the mid-point of our updated fiscal '16 guidance range. In our press release that we issued this morning, we listed our key assumptions related to our preliminary fiscal '17 guidance. But there are 3 specific guidance assumptions I would like to highlight on our call.
Number 1, generic pricing. As mentioned earlier, the trends haven't changed from what we previously expected. Our working assumption for fiscal '17 is that generic deflation remains in the high single-digit range. Number 2, the Medicare Part B demonstration project and the impact to our specialty business. With a lack of clarity on what, if anything, gets implemented and importantly, the timing, it's just too early to estimate the impact to our business.
And #3, the new accounting rules regarding share based compensation. While it's likely we will early adopt the new accounting rule in our fiscal '17, our guidance range does not contemplate the impact from an implementation. Most of our share based compensation is weighted towards stock options. This makes forecasting the tax benefit more challenging, because it's difficult to predict when the employee will exercise and importantly, the ABC share price at the time of exercise. Our current thinking is that the EPS impact will likely be modest.
As I wrap up my comments, overall, we are pleased with our results this quarter. As we move into our fourth fiscal quarter, we believe we're gaining traction in our core drug business. Our ABSG specialty business continues to have good momentum. And MWI and PharMEDium, our most recent acquisitions, are performing very well. As always, we thank you for your interest in ABC. Let me now turn it over to Barbara to start the Q&A."

And then, maybe if you could dig in to that a little bit, on maybe where you saw deterioration in pricing. Just because I think that observation probably does run a little counter to what we were hearing from both manufacturers and others in the supply chain, at least relative to last quarter."

But again, I want to stress that, that's what we expected across our portfolio, and our portfolio is unique to ABC. I still think that, and Steve can jump in, that we can navigate through that deflation. And we feel like it's still -- that's just one aspect of how we make money on generics."

So it's -- one thing that may not have been immediately evident is, when we -- we're just getting so much granular about the business. And when we talked about our oncology business, I don't know if you noticed in my script, I said, we're in all different sites of care, even within specialty. So we've got an increasing oral oncology business, and we've got an increasing hospital business, which often gets done through ASD, as well as our traditional Oncology Supply ION businesses. So there is just a lot of granularity, and this is the first time we've really started measuring what we do in oncology, not just only in our specialty business. And we do a lot of oncology, by the way, of course, in our health system business within Drug, which is a really strong franchise for us also. 
But on the manufacturers side, the manufacturers are increasingly looking at specialty as a different business, and they're looking at what components of the fee-for-service agreement do they want to see in a more specialty-oriented product. And those are traditional, established manufacturers, the Lilys and Pfizers and Mercks of the world, as well as the more traditional specialty manufacturers that you associate with biotech products and specialty products. So these fee-for-service agreements we have with manufacturers are becoming more nuanced, and we expect that to continue. And that's why I'm pleased that the Peyton Howell leadership we've got, a really strong customer-focused, and manufacturer-focused team that focuses on access and sites of delivery, as well as the economics of these products. And we -- I think we're managing through this very well. Almost every customer that we speak to understands these trends. When really, on the contracting side, the comments last quarter were probably more on the provider changing pricing environment as supposed to manufacturer changes where these trends have been well understood. And we're more in constant fee-for-service negotiation discussions with manufacturers, the next generation, as opposed to say Kaiser, which is a 5 or 7-year contract. 7-years is well, 5 years this time, and it's a very intermittent contracting opportunity. So those are really, I hope that's all clear, because it is very fluid and nuanced."

And like we've done in the rest of our business, we signed the anchor tenants to long-term contracts. I met with all of them, candid discussions. They're not shy to voice their opinions. But overall, I think ABC has really taken -- you may be surprised with this, but it's not the impression you generally have, a very technology-enabled approach. So I think when you look at the sort of asset we had, we had this technology and innovation center at our trade show last week. I was there right when it opened, because I was getting a preview of all the different offerings we had. So we had this virtual reality experience, a type encounter where we showed the history, but also what the future of pharmacy could be like. And it would just live[ph] to see that. Some of the apps that we have. The ABC order, we had 200 pharmacists that were involved in the development of that new interface, which is probably the way that our customers will be interfacing more and more with us. So I think we're getting into a more digitally enabled Good Neighbor Pharmacy type environment. Bob Mauch talks a lot. When I was with him, we met with customers, really about there's no reason that experience shouldn't be as rich as when you work with Amazon or one of these other primary e-commerce sites. And that's really what our goal is. And there was a lot of discussion on passport in the past. The generation of ordering interface that we're replacing about the search feature. Now the search feature's going to be just better. Not wanting to get into too much granularity, but we're really proud of, under the leadership of CIO and just strong IT presence throughout the business, where we're moving the technology for our customers. And we all measure success through project sales, through just Good Neighbor Pharmacy membership. To elevate participation, which is going extremely well, And I'm just pleased that we've got these key anchor tenants locked down, and we can work on helping them grow. So it's a lot early to quantity, and those are quality, and we feel good and we think there's upside there. I think we've, maybe forward and back a percent or two, and I think we hope to regain that but really through growth of the services and investing in the customers that we have."

We appreciate you joining us on this very busy day. I am pleased to report solid performance in our June quarter and good progress on the objectives for fiscal 2016 that we laid out in early May.

I am pleased to report solid performance in our June quarter and good progress on the objectives for fiscal 2016 that we laid out in early May. Revenues were up nearly 8% and adjusted EPS was up 14%. 
Certain areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group also continued its strong performance in the June quarter. In AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, we renewed our distribution relationship with Kaiser Permanente for 5 years, and achieved the benefits of some expense reduction earlier than expected. With many of our large customer renewals now behind us, we feel really good about our market position in all of our key portfolio segments. While there's still work to be done, I am thrilled to commend our associates for their successful work and dedication in ensuring that we are well positioned as we approach the end of the fiscal year and look ahead towards next year.
As I have said many times, we are fortunate to play a key role in a vibrant industry and to have a stronghold in the U.S. market, which is still the best market in the world. U.S. organic sales growth continues to be strong and the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry dynamics remain competitive, but stable. In addition, we take great pride in our ability to increasingly meet the needs of our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners on a global scale and to use our extensive knowledge, reach and partnership philosophy to help our health care provider customers better serve their patients. 
Turning now to our performance in the quarter. Tim will provide the details, but I want to highlight some key items. I just returned from ThoughtSpot, our annual retail trade show in Las Vegas, where we hosted a record number of independent community pharmacy attendees. I was excited to see firsthand the enthusiasm with which our independent customers are embracing our new offerings. 
In Las Vegas, we renewed our long-standing commitment to community pharmacy, and we highlighted several resources we had been investing in to ensure our GNP stores remain successful. 
Our government advocacy resources include a new Internet site called ourindependentvoice.com, which provides pharmacists with a centralized place to access tools to drive advocacy movements and stay abreast of community and legislative developments. 
Our front end retail excellence programs helps our members optimize front end sales, take advantage of manufacturer promotions and make better use of point-of-sale data and reporting tools. We have also introduced ABC Order, our next-generation ordering platform that is specifically engineered to work within pharmacy workflow and will be available in 2017. 
While community providers certainly face challenges in the rapidly evolving health care landscape, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacies. The future is in value-based and patient-centered care, which is exactly the type of care that our independent pharmacy customers excel at providing. The future will also demand the seamless integration of technology and personalized service. And our latest offerings in these areas will enable our independent customers to be on the forefront of this evolution in pharmacy care. We have deployed new offerings that streamline pharmacy operations and reimbursement activities. In addition, we are providing innovative tools that simultaneously enrich the patient's experience while improving the pharmacy's efficiency.
Finally, we stand beside all our customers and the patients they serve as we advocate on their behalf with state and federal legislators and regulators. Our primary work in Washington is to ensure that our customers receive a fair share of the health care dollar amidst increasing pressure on costs from all payer segments and an increasingly transparent and demanding environment. In a tumultuous political environment, it is very important to remain engaged to ensure adequate reimbursement and to preserve patient access to care.
Before I move on, I want to take a moment to recognize a great colleague and to thank Dave Neu, as he retires from AmerisourceBergen after 34 years of extraordinary service to the company and our retail pharmacy customers. Dave started his career as a truck driver and rose through the ranks to become the Head of Our Direct Company before ending his career as the President of Good Neighbor Pharmacy. Dave's vision and customer-centric philosophy helped make ABC a true leader and his dedication to excellence and to mentoring the next generation of leaders will be sorely missed. 
We are excited that Brian Nightengale has ably stepped into the leading role in our retail sales operations and Good Neighbor Pharmacy program. Brian is a pharmacist and came to ABC as the co-founder of Xcenda, one of our market-leading consulting businesses. Like so many of our leaders, Brian elected to stay with the company after the acquisition of Xcenda because he believes in the vision and the people of ABC. As a business founder, he brings an entrepreneurial spirit to GNP, as well as deep experience in specialty, manufacturer services and value-based care. I am very excited about Brian's unique fit for this role and it was awesome to see him already deeply engaged with customers last week at our trade show.
As I mentioned earlier, we renewed our long-standing relationship with Kaiser Permanente for an additional 5 years. We are very pleased that this premier health care system has chosen to remain our partner, and we look forward to continuing our history of innovation focused on the Kaiser Permanente members. 
During the quarter, we made steady progress in our efforts to evolve our customer's pricing strategy on brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. Every conversation we are having with our customers regarding contracts and renewals, as great is this challenge, and we are pleased that our customers are not only receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher price brand and specialty products, but are open to finding workable solutions.
ABDC will continue to face occasional headwinds as we renew customers in the ordinary course of time. But we are pleased that so many key customers are signed on to long-term contracts. 
PharMEDium, which of course is now part of ABDC, had a great quarter. The integration of PharMEDium had been seamless and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our hospital customers have proven to be receptive to the products and services that PharMEDium provides, and the scale and quality of their compounded, sterile preparations is a primary driver in their ability to earn new business. Bob Mauch and I visited PharMEDium a few weeks ago, and I'm really pleased about the quality-based innovative approach they are taking to ensure ever higher standards of efficiency and safety while working in a demanding regulatory environment. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, and I am very excited about the future potential of this business.
As I conclude my comments on our drug company, I want to say a few words about drug pricing. Drug pricing trends in the quarter on both branded and generic products were in line with our expectations, though some of the brand increases came earlier than expected. Generic deflation in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. The intense focus on the cost of both traditional and specialty pharmaceutical care will persist for some time, and will come from different venues. But in the efforts to manage the expense of health care, we must not sacrifice patient access to care. AmerisourceBergen is increasingly the partner of choice for manufacturers and health care providers alike, who are working to demonstrate the immense value inherent in many patient therapies and the life-changing impacts they have on patients and their health outcomes. Our ability to work collaboratively across the entire health care spectrum to preserve patient access enables us to be an attractive partner in a rapidly changing marketplace.
AmerisourceBergen's Specialty Group, which has long championed patient access to specialty products, once again had a strong quarter with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs, and these products are vital to all of our customers. 
As I explained last quarter, the economics of specialty products vary depending on the channel in which of the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefits, and the extent to which we can add value for the manufacturer and the provider. In most cases, the best economic opportunity for ABC is with the products that are administered by physicians that is treating a patient in a community setting, because that is where we can provide the most value to both the manufacturer and the provider. 
As we have discussed before, our unique position in specialty, sets us up well to be a future leader in biosimilars. While we haven't seen many launches yet, we are pleased to see some promising developments around FDA panel approvals of biosimilars. 
The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a valuable partner in nearly every aspect of bringing the product to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics, to consulting our commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the market for biosimilars. 
Taken individually, our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is our oncology franchise, our plasma, vaccine and physician office distribution businesses or our third-party logistics business. Taken together, the Specialty Group is the undisputed leader enabling Specialty Product's success and is the essential partner for manufacturers, for providers and ultimately, for the patients they serve. This portfolio of offerings we have both will only become more important as biosimilars come to market and personalized medicine becomes more prevalent, because all of these innovations will take place in an environment that is laser-focused on value and cost efficiency.
In addition, just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians who are caring for some of the sickest patients. I've been working with community physicians for more than 20 years, and I have always been inspired by the way they care for their patients. The cost to administer the product, and to care for these patients are significant, and the risk associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms on Part B drugs. And will do so in a way that keeps patient welfare paramount. 
Our manufacturer services businesses also had a solid June quarter. Our expertise in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and quality areas are clear differentiators for ABC. The increasingly global reach we have established in this area, also further expands our value propositions to manufacturers, especially Canada, Western Europe and Brazil. 
Our best-in-class Consulting Services within Lash Group performed well in the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform would unlock new possibilities for growth by driving internal efficiencies and expanding our capability to provide custom tailored programs and services to our manufacture customers. 
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier recently launched Cocoon, a new transport service that utilizes innovative packaging for temperature-sensitive materials. Cocoon offers a powerful combination of lower weight and proven higher performance that eliminates the need to sacrifice quality for cost. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well, and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. I'm especially pleased with the strong results they continue to deliver. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business with organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains, all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI's private label generics program, Vet One, is also growing above market as it adds additional products to its portfolio and is achieving increased penetration.
We continue to discover ways in which MWI enhances ABC and the addition of MWI has added a new perspective and dimension to our pharmaceutical manufacturer relationships. We have learned a lot from one another, especially in sourcing and supply chain activities, where the best practices on both the human and animal health side of the business, were even more complementary than we first envisioned. The MWI team has also been working closely with ABDC's warehouse management experts to identify areas where we can drive scale efficiencies and implement best practices. These collaborative efforts have been very successful, and I applaud our team for being open to innovation on both sides. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. It is an area which we will continue to invest in as we have only just begun to realize the full set of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Looking ahead, as we noted in the press release, we now expect our adjusted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, an increase of 11% to 12% over fiscal year '15. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year and to have completed $350 million in share repurchases by fiscal year-end. We have also reiterated the preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 that we gave last quarter, which includes adjusted EPS growth in the range of 4% to 6%, on revenue growth in line with the market. Tim will provide additional details on our working assumptions. But keep in mind that we are still in our planning process and will provide our full guidance in early November. 
Over the longer term, we would expect to be able to grow revenues slightly above the market, grow gross profits slightly slower than revenues, drive some operating leverage, generate free cash flow at approximately 125% of net income and benefit from the balanced redeployment of capital, including both strategic and synergistic M&A and share repurchases. Ultimately, our aspirational goal is to achieve adjusted EPS growth in the mid-teens.
In summary and in conclusion, I continue to have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. The strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated assets is a compelling value proposition for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our seasoned management team shares my passion and drive for producing excellent results while also delivering outstanding customer service. Our dedication to continuous improvement and the quality of our offerings, our associates' track record of seamless execution, our financial performance and our thoughtful capital management all help us ensure we will generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
Now I will turn it over to Tim."
24809,371785201,1022511,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone.

Consistent with past quarters, my remarks this morning will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. I would ask that you refer to our press release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results.
Please note that all financial comparisons I make this morning are for the third quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. I have 3 primary areas to cover this morning: first, I will recap our fiscal Q3 consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our revised fiscal '16 expectations; and third, I will provide updated commentary on fiscal '17. With that, we can begin our third quarter review.
Revenues were $36.9 billion, up 8%. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment accounted for almost all of our revenue growth. As a reminder, included in the segment is our PharMEDium acquisition. They accounted for a relatively small part of our overall ABC revenue increase. The quarter's adjusted gross profit increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Our pharmaceutical distribution segment accounted for roughly 80% of our gross profit dollar growth, with PharMEDium being a key contributor to this growth. 
Operating expenses. Our total adjusted OpEx increased 4% to $574 million. Last quarter, we mentioned on our call that we are focused on expenses and ensuring we spend in the right areas. We believe we made good progress in this area in the June quarter.
Looking forward to our fourth quarter, please keep in mind that we typically have a seasonal increase in our operating expenses, primarily around payroll and compensation. 
Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $493 million, up $38 million or 8%. Our adjusted operating margin was 1.34%, a 1 basis point improvement. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 32.8% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. As highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated a lower tax rate due to the growth in our international businesses. We continue to expect that our full year tax rate will be roughly 33%.
As a reminder, this tax rate is durable as long as our mix of U.S. to international business stays at its current level. For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $1.37, driven mostly by the performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and to a lesser degree, from our lower effective tax rate. 
Our adjusted diluted share count was just under 229 million shares, down about 1% from last year. Let me highlight that in this quarter, we did have a positive EPS contribution of a few pennies from 2 items. The first item, we had 2 earlier than expected brand manufacturer price increases, coming in June versus July. And the second item, we had some expense savings that came faster than anticipated and exceeded our expectations.
Turning now to our third quarter segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $35.4 billion, up a very solid 8%. Our Drug Company had a growth rate of 6.5%. This growth was after a revenue headwind of roughly 1.5% due to lower hepatitis C sales. The Drug Company had solid growth across several customer segments, including Walgreens, which grew at approximately 7%. Additionally, PharMEDium had another quarter of excellent unit volume growth, which drove a very good top line revenue increase for their business.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had their highest revenue growth rate this year, with revenue increasing about 20%, driven mostly by volume. ICS, our third-party logistics business, accounted for 5% of specialty's 20% revenue growth, due primarily to a new manufacturer relationship that started late last fiscal year. We also continued to realize meaningful revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs across the few of our businesses and to a lesser degree, from the sale of ophthalmology drugs in our Besse Medical business. 
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $794 million, up $49 million or 7%. The increase in gross profit dollars was split somewhat evenly between the Drug Company and ABSG. Our Drug Company's increase was mostly from PharMEDium, which performed better than expected.
Segment operating income was $411 million and was up 9%. The growth was the direct result of higher revenues and the corresponding income contribution, combined with tight expense management. 
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we're making in this segment, and we are especially pleased with the performance of our ABSG specialty business.
We can now move to our Other segment, which includes MWI, Consulting Services and World Courier. In the June quarter, segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 3%. The segment had a revenue headwind of a few percentage points from a piece of business that moved from our TheraCom distribution business back to the manufacturer.
Growth rates in our core Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI businesses, were all in line with what we expected. MWI continues to perform exceptionally well, with percentage revenue growth in the companion animal segment in the high single-digits. On the production animal side of the business, revenue growth was still a little low, but we are very encouraged based on cattle market trends that growth rates will pick up as we move into late summer and fall. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $83 million, up 7%, driven primarily from MWI and our World Courier businesses. Turning next to working capital and cash flow items.
In the June quarter, we had modest free cash flow generation when compared to our 2 previous quarters this fiscal year. The lower cash generation was due to a sizable impact from timing, unfavorable working capital in the June quarter that reversed during the first week of July. Additionally, free cash was also impacted from the extra working capital investment we made with Walgreens. I should remind everyone that this working capital investment will continue to be phased-in over the next few quarters. 
At June 30, we had $1.9 billion in cash on our balance sheet. This includes $470 million offshore, related primarily to our Switzerland and World Courier businesses. And during the quarter, we purchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for about $100 million under our regular share repurchase authorization.
Moving to our revised fiscal '16 expectations. Before I cover our specific guidance measures, let me just make a few brief comments on the drug pricing environment, in addition to what Steve discussed earlier, starting with generics. 
Our generic portfolio, or basket of generic drugs, through July as expected, deflated in a high single-digit range. Let me highlight that our deflation rate is calculated using our specific sales mix and inventory levels for our fiscal year. Other than the supply chain, they calculate their indexes differently. More likely, will have a slightly different deflation rate because of their unique mix of business. 
While there are several market factors that can impact our forward-looking assumption based on what we know today, we expect that our generic deflation rate will remain where it is currently through the end of our fiscal year September 30. 
Switching to branded drugs. The month of July has historically been a period where we tend to see a number of brand drug price increases. This current July was not an exception. The number of increases that rates of increase were are mostly in line with what we expected, except for the 2 manufacturers that announced their price increases earlier than expected in June. 
We can now move to our updated fiscal '16 P&L guidance. Adjusted EPS, as we enter our fourth quarter, as a reminder, new pricing for the Kaiser renewal took effect on July 1. Our EPS guidance range is now $5.52 to $5.57, which is growth of 11% to 12% versus last fiscal year. Free cash flow, we still expect to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And for share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase about $350 million for the full year.
The final topic I want to cover this morning is a commentary on our fiscal '17 outlook. Even though we are in the middle of our planning process, we are still comfortable with the preliminary guidance we gave last quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS. We expect growth in the range of 4% to 6% from the mid-point of our updated fiscal '16 guidance range. In our press release that we issued this morning, we listed our key assumptions related to our preliminary fiscal '17 guidance. But there are 3 specific guidance assumptions I would like to highlight on our call.
Number 1, generic pricing. As mentioned earlier, the trends haven't changed from what we previously expected. Our working assumption for fiscal '17 is that generic deflation remains in the high single-digit range. Number 2, the Medicare Part B demonstration project and the impact to our specialty business. With a lack of clarity on what, if anything, gets implemented and importantly, the timing, it's just too early to estimate the impact to our business.
And #3, the new accounting rules regarding share based compensation. While it's likely we will early adopt the new accounting rule in our fiscal '17, our guidance range does not contemplate the impact from an implementation. Most of our share based compensation is weighted towards stock options. This makes forecasting the tax benefit more challenging, because it's difficult to predict when the employee will exercise and importantly, the ABC share price at the time of exercise. Our current thinking is that the EPS impact will likely be modest.
As I wrap up my comments, overall, we are pleased with our results this quarter. As we move into our fourth fiscal quarter, we believe we're gaining traction in our core drug business. Our ABSG specialty business continues to have good momentum. And MWI and PharMEDium, our most recent acquisitions, are performing very well. As always, we thank you for your interest in ABC. 
Let me now turn it over to Barbara to start the Q&A."

And then, maybe if you could dig in to that a little bit, on maybe where you saw deterioration in pricing. Just because I think that observation probably does run a little counter to what we were hearing from both manufacturers and others in the supply chain, at least relative to last quarter."

But again, I want to stress that, that's what we expected across our portfolio, and our portfolio is unique to ABC. I still think that, and Steve can jump in, that we can navigate through that deflation. And we feel like it's still -- that's just one aspect of how we make money on generics."

And we are confident, Bob, that whatever the environment, we will continue to do very well in generics. We think our sourcing is excellent. The volume, the trend towards-- so many of the prescriptions are generics. So that's just the great trend for us. They are so going to be significant generic launches next year. And then there's this morning, this is a price inflation in unique circumstances, based on usually some manufacturer makes demands, so."

So it's -- one thing that may not have been immediately evident is, when we -- we're just getting so much granular about the business. And when we talked about our oncology business, I don't know if you noticed in my script, I said, we're in all diff",371,"Yes. So it's -- one thing that may not have been immediately evident is, when we -- we're just getting so much granular about the business. And when we talked about our oncology business, I don't know if you noticed in my script, I said, we're in all different sites of care, even within specialty. So we've got an increasing oral oncology business, and we've got an increasing hospital business, which often gets done through ASD as well as our traditional Oncology Supply ION businesses. So there is just a lot of granularity, and this is the first time we've really started measuring what we do in oncology, not just only in our specialty business. And we do a lot of oncology, by the way, of course, in our health system business within Drug, which is a really strong franchise for us also. But on the manufacturers side, the manufacturers are increasingly looking at specialty as a different business, and they're looking at what components of the fee-for-service agreement do they want to see in a more specialty-oriented product. And those are traditional, established manufacturers, the Lilys and Pfizers and Mercks of the world as well as the more traditional specialty manufacturers that you associate with biotech products and specialty products. So these fee-for-service agreements we have with manufacturers are becoming more nuanced, and we expect that to continue. And that's why I'm pleased that the Peyton Howell leadership we've got, a really strong customer-focused, and manufacturer-focused team that focuses on access and sites of delivery as well as the economics of these products. And we -- I think we're managing through this very well. Almost every customer that we speak to understands these trends. When really, on the contracting side, the comments last quarter were probably more on the provider changing pricing environment as supposed to manufacturer changes where these trends have been well understood. And we're more in constant fee-for-service negotiation discussions with manufacturers, the next generation, as opposed to say Kaiser, which is a 5 or 7-year contract. 7-years is well, 5 years this time, and it's a very intermittent contracting opportunity. So those are really, I hope that's all clear, because it is very fluid and nuanced."

But overall, I think ABC has really taken -- you may be surprised with this, but it's not the impression you generally have, a very technology-enabled approach. So I think when you look at the sort of asset we had, we had this technology and innovation center at our trade show last week. I was there right when it opened, because I was getting a preview of all the different offerings we had. So we had this virtual reality experience, a type encounter where we showed the history, but also what the future of pharmacy could be like. And it would just live [ph] to see that. Some of the apps that we have. The ABC order, we had 200 pharmacists that were involved in the development of that new interface, which is probably the way that our customers will be interfacing more and more with us. So I think we're getting into a more digitally enabled Good Neighbor Pharmacy type environment. Bob Mauch talks a lot. When I was with him, we met with customers, really about there's no reason that experience shouldn't be as rich as when you work with Amazon or one of these other primary e-commerce sites. And that's really what our goal is. And there was a lot of discussion on passport in the past. The generation of ordering interface that we're replacing about the search feature. Now the search feature's going to be just better. Not wanting to get into too much granularity, but we're really proud of, under the leadership of CIO and just strong IT presence throughout the business, where we're moving the technology for our customers. And we all measure success through project sales, through just Good Neighbor Pharmacy membership. To elevate participation, which is going extremely well, And I'm just pleased that we've got these key anchor tenants locked down, and we can work on helping them grow. So it's a lot early to quantity, and those are quality, and we feel good and we think there's upside there. I think we've, maybe forward and back a percent or two, and I think we hope to regain that but really through growth of the services and investing in the customers that we have."

24809,403594718,1070101,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone.Before I begin my comments on AmerisourceBergen's performance, I would like to start by directly addressing some of the recent comments regarding competition in the Pharmaceutical Distribution market. It is tr",3072,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone.
Before I begin my comments on AmerisourceBergen's performance, I would like to start by directly addressing some of the recent comments regarding competition in the Pharmaceutical Distribution market. It is true that customers and manufacturers are acquiring more value today than ever before, but that is to be expected in a health care landscape, with both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers are facing increasing cost pressures and constant demands to demonstrate the value of the products and services we provide.
Our manufacturing provide our customers exceptional service levels and innovative solutions and have the good fortune of being able to choose between 3 extremely competent and high-quality wholesalers. While we each differentiate ourselves in specific ways, we are all very tied to our core supply-chain businesses with our own unique mixes of services, segment orientations and key customers, all of which will invariably lead to some differences in growth rates in spite of our sharing a common macro environment.
While it is sure that we have said we expect our revenue growth to exceed the overall market growth rate, that growth is driven by our outstanding mix of customers, many of who are expected to grow faster than the market, and by footprint and specialty, which also grows faster than the overall market. These 2 elements provide the organic growth that is the primary driver of our business. We take the selection and development of our customers very seriously as we believe those relationships are the foundation upon which our business is raised. In addition, the collaborative relationships we have built and the long term contracts we have signed with our key provider customers give us real confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
I do believe our relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is truly unique. No other wholesaler serves all the prescription needs and partners so comprehensively on supply chain as we do with WBA and WBAD. This year, our relationship continue to flourish, and we all believe there's more important, meaningful and profitable work left to accomplish. We look forward to facing the future with WBA as a strong and aligned partner.
I think it is also important to clarify our view of independent pharmacy market specifically. This has always been an important franchise for AmerisourceBergen, and we have spent a lot of time communicating in our past releases and investor conference discussions the investments we are making in Good Neighbor Pharmacy, business coaching, pro-generics and our third-party network, Elevate. Like all investments that we make, we expect that these investments should provide us a return. Specifically with independence, we are striving for improved compliance and share of wallet for our contracted customer base. We have deliberately chosen to work more with our established and proven relationships than to go and win new relationships that are not profitable or strategically relevant to our offering. An example of the deeper, more enduring relationships we have with independent customers is the 9-year exclusive relationship we signed this fiscal year with CPA, our largest independent buying group. This important customer is an innovator in their own right and has partnered with us for the long term because they share our vision for the future of community pharmacy.
It is also important to remember that we have now anniversary-ed the last of the independent buying group customer we called out in September of 2015. Since that time, we have worked hard to keep or win back some of the stores that were part of that buying group by rolling out significant enhancements to our key programs and services for our independent customers. As we have said, it took longer for those activities to gain traction than we would have liked, but we are pleased with the progress we have made. In addition to those activities, we have made a deliberate effort to protect our market share with existing customers and to put -- increase our rates of penetration with those customers primarily by reducing leakage, especially on generic products. As the share number of generic products has increased over the last several years, the sourcing opportunities that customers have had to acquire generic products also increased. As a result, we have had to work very diligently, not only to grow our share of wallet with each of our customers, but also to protect that share against the lure of short-term opportunities.
Some of those opportunities invariably arise outside of a formal RFP process or from nontraditional competitors like telemarketing companies. Our philosophy has always been to protect and enhance the prime vendor relationships we have with our customers, which is a unique cornerstone of the U.S. distribution industry, especially when compared to other international models. Our customers have responded favorably to these initiatives because they see the value inherent in sourcing all of their products from ABC at a fair price.
I commend our leadership and our drug company associates for the challenging work that they have done in these areas. Specifically, I feel ABC has been very transparent with not only our customers but our suppliers and our investors about the need to look at different pricing strategies for specialty products in the retail, outpatient and alternate care markets, serviced by our core drug wholesale business. As we have said before, due to the cadence of different sales side contract expiration, these changes do not happen overnight. This philosophy is reflected in all the significant new long-term contracts we signed this fiscal year.
Moving onto our results. I'm pleased to now discuss, as I had originally planned to do at the outset of this call, the successful conclusion to our fiscal year 2016. Today, we are reporting solid performance in our September quarter. We met the goals and objectives we laid out for our business in early May. Revenues were up 6% and adjusted EPS was up 12%.
We have made significant progress in addressing the challenging environment our core business faces, and certain other areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group has also continued its strong performance through the September quarter.
In fiscal year 2016, we grew our revenues 8% to nearly $147 billion; grew our adjusted diluted EPS 14% to $5.62; and generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion.
Over the course of the year, we improved our balance sheet, repurchased over $700 million of stock under our regular program and successfully mitigated the dilutive impact of a exercise of the 2 tranches of warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our strategic long-term relationship. Our solid operational performance and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2016 have provided us with significant financial flexibility heading into fiscal 2017. Over the course of my 5 years as CEO, I'm very proud that the company grew revenues at a compounded annual rate of 13%, which drove an EPS CAGR of 16% over the same period. We've grown the business in a variety of different ways, including through making internal investments through driving innovative partnerships with leading market-leading customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and by making thoughtful acquisitions to add to the capabilities and services we provide to help ensure we can continue to grow well into the future.
While we are looking ahead to a year that we expect will deliver growth somewhat below our historical rate of performance, I believe we have positioned ourselves well to work through the near-term headwinds and take advantage of the longer-term growth opportunities.
The investments we have made and the foundation we have built will serve us well as we navigate the complex and continuously evolving health care landscape. While the precise ways in which we generate earnings will change over time, I'm very confident that we will continue to drive growth because we provide an essential service to the global healthcare system and ultimately and most importantly, to patients. And we do so in an incredibly efficient and effective manner.
Let's turn now to the performance in our business units in the quarter. Our drug company had solid revenue growth of 5% and had good performance in all of its customer segments.
While our community pharmacy customers certainly face challenges in the rapidly changing environment, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. Patients are benefiting from the accessibility of pharmacy care and the expansion of healthcare offerings that are now being provided in community pharmacies. Tens of thousands of patients still turn to independent community pharmacy for all of their healthcare needs, and we are working to continue to expand upon that cornerstone of trusted healthcare.
I believe the programs we are offering at GNP and Elevate, among others, will continue to add value to this important segment and allow our customers to maintain their presence with their patients and the plans they service. This level of care demands the seamless integration of technology and personalized service, and our latest offerings in these areas continue to gain traction. We've also made meaningful improvements to our First to Shelf programs for new generic drug launches, and service levels in our pro generics program have never been higher. Having the enhanced stability to fulfill prescriptions for new generics immediately and to reliably meet patient demands for existing products are 2 of the most essential services community pharmacies provide. Even small improvements in these areas can help ensure that our customers are leaders in their local market and provide meaningful value to the patients they serve.
During the September quarter, we made additional progress in our efforts to evolve our customer contract strategies regarding brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. We are pleased that our customers are receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher-priced brand and specialty products and are open to finding workable solutions. While we will always have some contract renewals in any given year, most of the heavy lifting on large market-related adjustments required in our customer base is behind us, and we can now concentrate on the deeper and more robust collaborative work that comes from a shared partnership and a desire to create respectful, balanced relationships.
During our fiscal year '17, we anticipate and would hope to renew our contract relationship with Express Scripts. There are no other disclosable contracts we will be discussing. Partnering with key customers and developing lasting, sustainable relationships has been a primary strategic objective of AmerisourceBergen for the last several year -- last several years. We knew the world would be changing quickly, and while we could not foresee every conceivable outcome, we believe that if we would partner with the right customers for the long term, we will be much better able to face the market challenges together. Being able to take a long view drives innovative thinking and is often the catalyst that unlocks the value that is obscured by uncertainty.
In addition to having the right customers, we need to make the right investments. A great example of this is PharMEDium, which had another strong quarter. We have almost reached the 1 year anniversary of the acquisition, and we could not be more pleased. Integration of PharMEDium has been seamless, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our health systems customers understand the value of the products and services that PharMEDium provides, but it is the quality of a compounded sterile IV preparations that enabled them to earn new business. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, hitting on all the important criteria we target for successful acquisitions culturally, strategically and financially, and we are very excited about the future potential of this business.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group once again had a strong quarter, with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs and have long championed patient access to specialty products. The economics of specialty products can vary depending on a few key factors: the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit; and the extent to which we could add value for the manufacturers and the provider. The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a trusted partner in nearly every aspect of bringing specialty products to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting on commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the markets for both innovative new therapies and for biosimilars. Our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is an oncology franchise, our plasma vaccine and physician office distribution businesses or our third party logistics business. Together, the group is the undisputed leader in enabling specialty products' success and is an essential partner for manufacturers, for providers and ultimately for the patients they serve.
This portfolio of offerings we have built will only become more important as the focus on value and cost efficiency increases. Just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians. Our network of oncology practices are very well-positioned for quality initiatives like oncology medical home, which improved overall value. Additionally, we continue to invest in our market-leading franchise of dispensing practices that are leveraging clinical integration and realtime care coordination within and beyond the practice to improve patient adherence and reduce side effects and waste.
As I said last quarter, the cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the risks associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms of Part B drugs and will do so in a way that is always patient-minded.
While being focused on some key technology deployments, our customer, our patient services and consulting businesses also had a solid September quarter. The expertise we have in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Over the last couple of years, we have worked to expand the global reach of these businesses to further enhance our value proposition to manufacturers. As we mentioned previously, our Consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform will enable new possibilities for growth by driving innovation and expanding our capability to provide custom-tailored programs and services to our manufacturer customers.
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC, and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. They had solid results in the quarter and a very good year. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business, with [ph] organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. Their performed exceptionally well from an operational and financial perspective, and its management has made significant and ongoing contributions to the whole of ABC. Among the many reasons we are so enthused about the business is the operational synergies ABC has brought to MWI such as their recently implemented WMS system and some of our technologies which enhanced patient intimacy in community setting. Likewise, MWI has brought ABC opportunities for more comprehensive discussions with suppliers in an area where we are truly competitively differentiated. We expect to continue to invest in animal health business as it is an area which have only just begun to realize the full slate of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Tim will provide the details, but I wanted to comment on the -- our key expectations heading into next year. In fiscal 2017, we expect to grow revenues in the range of 6.5% to 8% and to grow adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range that is flat to up 5% over the prior year. Our growth expectations have come down somewhat due to the increased uncertainty around brand drug inflation and the rate of generic deflation. We do expect, however, to return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of our fiscal year as we anniversary the customer contract renewal headwinds and we begin to lap some of the impact of decreases in drug pricing.
It is also worth noting that assuming the Walgreens and Rite Aid receive FTC clearance, we anticipate that we will begin to service Rite Aid towards the end of the fiscal year, and we have been making investments to ensure we are well-positioned to continue to drive the quality, scale and efficiency that this incremental volume will require of us.
In summary, I have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. Despite unexpected headwinds in the year, the fact is we now just reported a 40% EPS increase year following on the heels of back-to-back 20% class growth years. While I'm personally disappointed that our projected growth rate for fiscal 2017 is not as strong as our past 3 years performance, I believe strongly that the strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated services is and always will remain a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical manufacturers and provider customers. Our management team shares my passion and drive for producing strong and sustainable growth results while also delivering outstanding customer service. In the years ahead, we will continue to serve our industry with the same high level of discipline that we have demonstrated throughout the 15-year history of ABC in our legacy-formative companies. We provide a vital service in the global healthcare system, and we do so with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients while delivering balanced, long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Tim."

I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remark",2587,"Thanks, Steve good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results. As Steve mentioned, it was a challenging year in our industry and for ABC with the changing pharmaceutical pricing dynamics that we continue to work through. Overall, we did not finish exactly where we thought we would at the beginning of the year, but we successfully navigated a tough environment.
There's a lot to like about our fiscal '16. Let me spend a minute and cover a few key highlights. Most noteworthy would be the Drug Company's successful acquisition and integration of PharMEDium. We are very pleased with the result the business has delivered and we are also pleased with the new talent and skill sets the PharMEDium employees bring to ABC performance the second item, our ABSG specialty business has very impressive year with revenues passing $28 billion and they achieved record operating income. And finally, we exit the fiscal year with improved balance sheet and, importantly, we successfully mitigated all of the potential dilution from the shares issued to Walgreens as a result of the warrant exercises.
It's great have the warrants sufficiently behind us. This will simplify our reporting going forward. This morning, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. And I will wrap up covering our fiscal '17 expectations. Let's begin our Q4 review. Our revenues increased roughly $2 billion to $37.6 billion, up 6%. Operating income. Our adjusted operating income was $464 million, up $7 million or 2%. We certainly benefited from our operating expenses being down by 3%.
We made a concerted effort, through various cost initiatives, to reduce expenses throughout ABC. This offset our gross profit being down in both dollars and percentage.
Moving below the operating income line. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.4% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. I should highlight that our quarterly tax expense included a slight year-to-date adjustment to bring our full year tax rate to 32.5%. This rate is just below the tax rate we had previously guided to as a result of slightly higher international income and favorable discrete tax adjustments we made closing out our fiscal year.
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.30. Let me highlight, we finished fiscal year '16 with $220 million outstanding common shares. Please remember that the 220 million outstanding shares is before the dilutive impact from share-based compensation. When combined, this number is used to calculate our diluted earnings per share going forward.
Next, let me cover our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $36 billion, up 6%. Our Drug Company had solid revenue growth up [ph] 5%. I should highlight that we continue to lap very strong hepatitis C revenues from the prior year and this created a headwind in the current quarter of roughly 1.5%.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had revenue growth of just over 15%. The business has now anniversaried the addition of a 3PL customer that has been enhancing revenue growth over the last year. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see a specialty strong revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs growing in the high teens as a percentage.
Lastly, I should highlight that this quarter was another record revenue quarter for our ABSG business.
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $785 million, down just about 1%. We saw solid profit dollar growth in our specialty business due to higher revenues. Our Drug Company's gross profit was down versus last year even with the addition of PharMEDium. We had the impact from 2 contract renewals with anchor customers: Kaiser, which took effect on July 1; and also CPA, our largest independent buying group customer.
There is strategic importance in signing these large, fast-growing customers to longer-term contracts. However, in the 12 months following the resigning, the change in economics to bring the contract to the appropriate market price can be a meaningful headwind. Also, during the current quarter, we had a lower contribution from drug price inflation. These were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit dollars in our Drug Company business.
Segment operating expenses were $391 million and were down versus the prior year by 3%, about [ph] $14 million. Both the Drug Company and ABSG continue to closely manage their cost structures to ensure they are spending in the right areas. On a comparable basis to last year, so excluding the impact from PharMEDium, the segment's OpEx would have been down nearly 7%.
Adjusted segment operating income was $394 million, which is up 1%. Solid performance by our Specialty Group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the Drug Company.
We can now move to our Other segment which includes MWI, our Patient Services consulting business and World Courier. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 5%. Both our Consulting and World Courier businesses have solid revenue growth in the quarter. Our MWI business was a little lower in terms of revenue growth this quarter due to a combination of 2 things: an impact from foreign currency from the U.K. business; and an impact also from some expected seasonality in the U.S. business. Let me point out, we continue to be very pleased with the U.S. companion animal side of the business which had growth of nearly 6%. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $70 million, up 4%.
The growth is after year-end compensation and essential true-ups in all 3 businesses. Additionally, our consulting business is deep into their new ERP system implementation. Certain expenses that can't be capitalized negatively impacted the segment. These 2 items essentially reduced the growth rate by slightly more than half this quarter.
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal year 2016 financial metrics.
Revenue, our full year growth was a very good 8%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues. ABSG, our specialty business, finished the year at $28.5 billion with revenue growth of 17%. Just an outstanding year for this business.
Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to just over $2 billion. EPS, our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.62, up 14% due primarily to our operating income growth, mostly from our ABSG business and also having MWI for a full fiscal year.
Our Drug Company had a challenging year with a negative impacts from contract renewals and industry drug pricing headwinds, but the benefit from PharMEDium helped to offset these items. Free cash flow. We had a terrific finish to our fiscal year. We ended at $2.7 billion of free cash flow. Our fourth quarter was much better than previously anticipated due to higher revenues and certain one-time working capital benefits at ABSG, as well as a greater-than-expected positive impact from ending our year on a Friday, which is our best cash receipts day.
Now let's turn to fiscal '17 expectations. Before I start working through specific guidance items, I will make some overarching comments. Importantly, we have not included any impact to our P&L and cash flow from our largest customer, Walgreens successfully completing their acquisition write a. In light of the current pharmaceutical market dynamics, I want to comment on 3 key working assumptions. First, let's start with brand drug pricing. During fiscal '16, our brand inflation rate finished right at 10%. We did see some further moderation from the 10% during September and it has continued through October. So as we think about fiscal '17, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to a range of 7% to 9%.
Lowering this range translates to a gross profit headwind to our fiscal '17 growth targets.
The next period where we traditionally see a high level of announcement activity will be in the month of January. Consequently, we have a period of time before we know how we're tracking against this assumption.
Next, generic drug pricing. We continue to expect a contribution from a modest level of price increases. But overall, our generic drug basket is expected to deflate in the 7% to 9% range during fiscal 2017. This rate is consistent with what we have experienced the second half of fiscal '16, and, importantly, recent trends in the market indicate that the generic deflation rate did not improve, unfortunately.
In fiscal '17, the generic deflation rate will be a gross profit headwind for the entire fiscal year as opposed to just a partial year in fiscal '16.
And finally, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-to-year. We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal '17. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the range of 6.5% to 8%. While the decrease in the rate of brand drug inflation will weigh on our Drug Company's revenue growth, we expect our ABSG specialty business to grow slightly above 10%. In the Other segment, we expect revenues to grow between 7% and 8%. Consolidated gross profit. We all provide specific guidance on gross profit but to repeat previous commentary, our Drug Company business will have a significant gross profit headwind from 2 key customer contract renewals, CPA through the first 2 quarters of fiscal '17; and Kyser, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17.
Consolidated operating expenses. We expect the growth rate in this area of roughly 6% to 7% in fiscal '17. On past calls, we've noted that we are incurring incremental operating expenses related to strategic systems and technology we are always implementing across the organization. Since these systems are all fairly significant in size and scope, most will be implemented while running parallel with existing systems. But we also point out that our Drug Company is underway with a large capital projects that will both upgrade and also expand capacity in their distribution center network, due in part to our expectation that eventually, we will serve the right age stores on behalf of Walgreens.
We are currently building 7 new distribution centers, 2 of these are incremental to the network while the remaining 5 are relocations to larger, more modern facilities. As a reference point, the 5 relocations, so that DCs that are being replaced average 32 years in service life. Most of the associated dollars spent will be capitalized and excuse me, however, this is also the same situation where we expect to incur duplicate expenses as we operate both the new and old distribution centers for a period of time.
These IT systems and infrastructure investments support our growth, improve this customer experience, and ultimately, increase our operating efficiency. However, there is a negative impact to our fiscal '17 operating expense growth rate of a couple of percentage points.
Consolidated adjusted operating income. We expect ABC operating income dollars to be in the range of down slightly to up 4%. This is driven by our Drug Company having EBIT that is flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We do expect good organic growth in our ABSG business but not enough to offset the lower growth in the Drug Company and the gross profit headwinds I called out previously.
We expect the Other segment to grow EBIT in the high single-digit percentage range. Switching to operating margin. We expect consolidated margin to be down 5 to 10 basis points due primarily to mix of business, so large customers growing faster; and the impacts from our large contract renewals. Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 33%. Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes modest share buybacks but not to offset the dilutive impact from equity incentives. We are pleased that we are able to announce this morning in our earnings release our new $1 billion share authorization. We now have capacity of about $1.1 billion. As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions.
Adjusted EPS. Over the last few months, unpredictability around pharmaceutical pricing has increased. Therefore, we are lowering our expected fiscal '17 EPS growth rates and also widening the range until such time that we have more clarity on these pharmaceutical pricing dynamics, both brand inflation and the rate of generic drug deflation. Consequently, we expect our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.63 to $5.88. The growth rate range is now flat to up 5% over our fiscal year '16 adjusted EPS of $5.62.
Also, please note that we have not included any financial impact from the implementation of Medicare Part B, demonstration project in our adjusted EPS guidance. It's quite possible that Part B demo project will be delayed, altered or even litigated. Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression given the 2 large headwinds I called out previously, the 2 key contract renewals and moderating brand price inflation. We expect that our Q1 '17 adjusted EPS would be several cents below our actual results from Q1 '16. We also expect Q2 to be relatively flat to last year's results. We expect to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year as we cycled through these headwinds and have easier comparables.
Switching to cash flow. First, CapEx is expected to be slightly higher in fiscal '17 when compared to fiscal '16. It's likely we will reach $500 million due to the heavy capital investment underway, funding both the new IT systems and distribution centers. Debt repayments. We do have a $600 million note that will mature in May 2017. The proceeds from this note will be used to partially fund the repurchases of shares under our special share program now that the warrants are completed, it is our intent to repay this note at maturity.
Free cash flow. We now expect our free cash flow with fiscal '17 to be at or slightly above our adjusted net income. The expected year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to the following discrete items: one, the cash timing benefit we received from ending the year on a Friday. This benefit won't repeat. We estimate this impact to be roughly $500 million. Two, the continued investment in working capital with Walgreens; and three, certain one-time capital employments at our ABSG business that won't repeat in fiscal '17.
As I wrap up, I know that both Steve and my comments were especially long this morning due to cover in several important topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention.
I'd like to personally thank the ABC team for all the efforts made this year, delivering solid results in a challenging time for the industry. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year but the challenging times are still with us. With our outstanding customer portfolio, our ability to execute in our financial resources, we are confident we'll be able to continually adopt to working in a dynamic environment, and most importantly, delivering compelling, long-term shareholder value.
We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

But let me talk about it this way, I mean, my comments on I think very appropriate for AmerisourceBergen, I can talk about others, but we would say that the market is competitive but rational. It's always been that way. The environment is probably more challenging and I think that's a function of customer consolidation. You got a lot going on on the M&A side with key provider customers coming together, key manufacturers coming together. Everyone's facing our cost and efficiency challenge and I would say hours customers are more consolidated, more informed and they've always been very sophisticated and quite adopted at demanding valor value from us. And I think our industry has been responsive. And maybe we just have as many headwinds as we usually have but I think the environment is essentially the same as it's been from a competitive perspective for many, many years.

I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups. That's gotten really dive in, CPA is a very good example. So as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We sourced some contracts when we were getting high teens in our generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last because the industry changed. So we've been, as we've said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing and how that's going to change, I would say, a 9-year contract that we have with CPA. you have to be cognizant of that. You have to be thoughtful of that because ABC's always thinking about the long-term and what is that 9-year contract look like. Just because in the last 9 years, contracts have been variably improved, that doesn't mean the economics are going to change in the same way.

I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics and then an important question, and let Tim to also comment. As the group's consolidated, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We managed thousands and thousands of contracts but as an independent practice, we would say that 2000 are very important, very critical and they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility to have balanced pricing depending on customers. They have a tough time with Managed Care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are faces to those discussions and in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well.

So that's why having long-term contracts is extremely important so that we can work together on what the collaborative approach that are referred to in my script. I think actually that last is a pretty good example of that. It probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC but just one of those things that happen. I wouldn't say that, that point is a acute level of competition or anything or any of the storm we have heard about [indiscernible]. So the incremental share that we've had in independence is very, I think, we just are making sure we're holding ground with those new contracts we signed.

It's an efficient market, so we're going to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced. And then the market, I would say struggling a bit because I think our sales and our peer companies all looking at that compliance factor and have better tools to manage that and it is not the growth that you have from so many new product launches. I've talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting any product out upon a patent expiration effect, we're covering that.

We happen to think that it's actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide which in difficult times, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers.

It is tr",3072,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone.
Before I begin my comments on AmerisourceBergen's performance, I would like to start by directly addressing some of the recent comments regarding competition in the Pharmaceutical Distribution market. It is true that customers and manufacturers are acquiring more value today than ever before, but that is to be expected in a health care landscape, with both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers are facing increasing cost pressures and constant demands to demonstrate the value of the products and services we provide.
Our manufacturing provide our customers exceptional service levels and innovative solutions and have the good fortune of being able to choose between 3 extremely competent and high-quality wholesalers. While we each differentiate ourselves in specific ways, we are all very tied to our core supply-chain businesses with our own unique mixes of services, segment orientations and key customers, all of which will invariably lead to some differences in growth rates in spite of our sharing a common macro environment.
While it is sure that we have said we expect our revenue growth to exceed the overall market growth rate, that growth is driven by our outstanding mix of customers, many of who are expected to grow faster than the market, and by footprint and specialty, which also grows faster than the overall market. These 2 elements provide the organic growth that is the primary driver of our business. We take the selection and development of our customers very seriously as we believe those relationships are the foundation upon which our business is raised. In addition, the collaborative relationships we have built and the long term contracts we have signed with our key provider customers give us real confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
I do believe our relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is truly unique. No other wholesaler serves all the prescription needs and partners so comprehensively on supply chain as we do with WBA and WBAD. This year, our relationship continue to flourish, and we all believe there's more important, meaningful and profitable work left to accomplish. We look forward to facing the future with WBA as a strong and aligned partner.
I think it is also important to clarify our view of independent pharmacy market specifically. This has always been an important franchise for AmerisourceBergen, and we have spent a lot of time communicating in our past releases and investor conference discussions the investments we are making in Good Neighbor Pharmacy, business coaching, pro-generics and our third-party network, Elevate. Like all investments that we make, we expect that these investments should provide us a return. Specifically with independence, we are striving for improved compliance and share of wallet for our contracted customer base. We have deliberately chosen to work more with our established and proven relationships than to go and win new relationships that are not profitable or strategically relevant to our offering. An example of the deeper, more enduring relationships we have with independent customers is the 9-year exclusive relationship we signed this fiscal year with CPA, our largest independent buying group. This important customer is an innovator in their own right and has partnered with us for the long term because they share our vision for the future of community pharmacy.
It is also important to remember that we have now anniversary-ed the last of the independent buying group customer we called out in September of 2015. Since that time, we have worked hard to keep or win back some of the stores that were part of that buying group by rolling out significant enhancements to our key programs and services for our independent customers. As we have said, it took longer for those activities to gain traction than we would have liked, but we are pleased with the progress we have made. In addition to those activities, we have made a deliberate effort to protect our market share with existing customers and to put -- increase our rates of penetration with those customers primarily by reducing leakage, especially on generic products. As the share number of generic products has increased over the last several years, the sourcing opportunities that customers have had to acquire generic products also increased. As a result, we have had to work very diligently, not only to grow our share of wallet with each of our customers, but also to protect that share against the lure of short-term opportunities.
Some of those opportunities invariably arise outside of a formal RFP process or from nontraditional competitors like telemarketing companies. Our philosophy has always been to protect and enhance the prime vendor relationships we have with our customers, which is a unique cornerstone of the U.S. distribution industry, especially when compared to other international models. Our customers have responded favorably to these initiatives because they see the value inherent in sourcing all of their products from ABC at a fair price.
I commend our leadership and our drug company associates for the challenging work that they have done in these areas. Specifically, I feel ABC has been very transparent with not only our customers but our suppliers and our investors about the need to look at different pricing strategies for specialty products in the retail, outpatient and alternate care markets, serviced by our core drug wholesale business. As we have said before, due to the cadence of different sales side contract expiration, these changes do not happen overnight. This philosophy is reflected in all the significant new long-term contracts we signed this fiscal year.
Moving onto our results. I'm pleased to now discuss, as I had originally planned to do at the outset of this call, the successful conclusion to our fiscal year 2016. Today, we are reporting solid performance in our September quarter. We met the goals and objectives we laid out for our business in early May. Revenues were up 6% and adjusted EPS was up 12%.
We have made significant progress in addressing the challenging environment our core business faces, and certain other areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group has also continued its strong performance through the September quarter.
In fiscal year 2016, we grew our revenues 8% to nearly $147 billion; grew our adjusted diluted EPS 14% to $5.62; and generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion.
Over the course of the year, we improved our balance sheet, repurchased over $700 million of stock under our regular program and successfully mitigated the dilutive impact of a exercise of the 2 tranches of warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our strategic long-term relationship. Our solid operational performance and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2016 have provided us with significant financial flexibility heading into fiscal 2017. Over the course of my 5 years as CEO, I'm very proud that the company grew revenues at a compounded annual rate of 13%, which drove an EPS CAGR of 16% over the same period. We've grown the business in a variety of different ways, including through making internal investments through driving innovative partnerships with leading market-leading customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and by making thoughtful acquisitions to add to the capabilities and services we provide to help ensure we can continue to grow well into the future.
While we are looking ahead to a year that we expect will deliver growth somewhat below our historical rate of performance, I believe we have positioned ourselves well to work through the near-term headwinds and take advantage of the longer-term growth opportunities.
The investments we have made and the foundation we have built will serve us well as we navigate the complex and continuously evolving health care landscape. While the precise ways in which we generate earnings will change over time, I'm very confident that we will continue to drive growth because we provide an essential service to the global healthcare system and ultimately and most importantly, to patients. And we do so in an incredibly efficient and effective manner.
Let's turn now to the performance in our business units in the quarter. Our drug company had solid revenue growth of 5% and had good performance in all of its customer segments.
While our community pharmacy customers certainly face challenges in the rapidly changing environment, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. Patients are benefiting from the accessibility of pharmacy care and the expansion of healthcare offerings that are now being provided in community pharmacies. Tens of thousands of patients still turn to independent community pharmacy for all of their healthcare needs, and we are working to continue to expand upon that cornerstone of trusted healthcare.
I believe the programs we are offering at GNP and Elevate, among others, will continue to add value to this important segment and allow our customers to maintain their presence with their patients and the plans they service. This level of care demands the seamless integration of technology and personalized service, and our latest offerings in these areas continue to gain traction. We've also made meaningful improvements to our First to Shelf programs for new generic drug launches, and service levels in our pro generics program have never been higher. Having the enhanced stability to fulfill prescriptions for new generics immediately and to reliably meet patient demands for existing products are 2 of the most essential services community pharmacies provide. Even small improvements in these areas can help ensure that our customers are leaders in their local market and provide meaningful value to the patients they serve.
During the September quarter, we made additional progress in our efforts to evolve our customer contract strategies regarding brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. We are pleased that our customers are receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower margin and higher-priced brand and specialty products and are open to finding workable solutions. While we will always have some contract renewals in any given year, most of the heavy lifting on large market-related adjustments required in our customer base is behind us, and we can now concentrate on the deeper and more robust collaborative work that comes from a shared partnership and a desire to create respectful, balanced relationships.
During our fiscal year '17, we anticipate and would hope to renew our contract relationship with Express Scripts. There are no other disclosable contracts we will be discussing. Partnering with key customers and developing lasting, sustainable relationships has been a primary strategic objective of AmerisourceBergen for the last several year -- last several years. We knew the world would be changing quickly, and while we could not foresee every conceivable outcome, we believe that if we would partner with the right customers for the long term, we will be much better able to face the market challenges together. Being able to take a long view drives innovative thinking and is often the catalyst that unlocks the value that is obscured by uncertainty.
In addition to having the right customers, we need to make the right investments. A great example of this is PharMEDium, which had another strong quarter. We have almost reached the 1 year anniversary of the acquisition, and we could not be more pleased. Integration of PharMEDium has been seamless, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our health systems customers understand the value of the products and services that PharMEDium provides, but it is the quality of a compounded sterile IV preparations that enabled them to earn new business. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, hitting on all the important criteria we target for successful acquisitions culturally, strategically and financially, and we are very excited about the future potential of this business.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group once again had a strong quarter, with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs and have long championed patient access to specialty products. The economics of specialty products can vary depending on a few key factors: the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit; and the extent to which we could add value for the manufacturers and the provider. The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a trusted partner in nearly every aspect of bringing specialty products to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting on commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the markets for both innovative new therapies and for biosimilars. Our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is an oncology franchise, our plasma vaccine and physician office distribution businesses or our third party logistics business. Together, the group is the undisputed leader in enabling specialty products' success and is an essential partner for manufacturers, for providers and ultimately for the patients they serve.
This portfolio of offerings we have built will only become more important as the focus on value and cost efficiency increases. Just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians. Our network of oncology practices are very well-positioned for quality initiatives like oncology medical home, which improved overall value. Additionally, we continue to invest in our market-leading franchise of dispensing practices that are leveraging clinical integration and realtime care coordination within and beyond the practice to improve patient adherence and reduce side effects and waste.
As I said last quarter, the cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the risks associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms of Part B drugs and will do so in a way that is always patient-minded.
While being focused on some key technology deployments, our customer, our patient services and consulting businesses also had a solid September quarter. The expertise we have in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Over the last couple of years, we have worked to expand the global reach of these businesses to further enhance our value proposition to manufacturers. As we mentioned previously, our Consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform will enable new possibilities for growth by driving innovation and expanding our capability to provide custom-tailored programs and services to our manufacturer customers.
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC, and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. They had solid results in the quarter and a very good year. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business, with [ph] organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. Their performed exceptionally well from an operational and financial perspective, and its management has made significant and ongoing contributions to the whole of ABC. Among the many reasons we are so enthused about the business is the operational synergies ABC has brought to MWI such as their recently implemented WMS system and some of our technologies which enhanced patient intimacy in community setting. Likewise, MWI has brought ABC opportunities for more comprehensive discussions with suppliers in an area where we are truly competitively differentiated. We expect to continue to invest in animal health business as it is an area which have only just begun to realize the full slate of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Tim will provide the details, but I wanted to comment on the -- our key expectations heading into next year. In fiscal 2017, we expect to grow revenues in the range of 6.5% to 8% and to grow adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range that is flat to up 5% over the prior year. Our growth expectations have come down somewhat due to the increased uncertainty around brand drug inflation and the rate of generic deflation. We do expect, however, to return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of our fiscal year as we anniversary the customer contract renewal headwinds and we begin to lap some of the impact of decreases in drug pricing.
It is also worth noting that assuming the Walgreens and Rite Aid receive FTC clearance, we anticipate that we will begin to service Rite Aid towards the end of the fiscal year, and we have been making investments to ensure we are well-positioned to continue to drive the quality, scale and efficiency that this incremental volume will require of us.
In summary, I have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. Despite unexpected headwinds in the year, the fact is we now just reported a 40% EPS increase year following on the heels of back-to-back 20% class growth years. While I'm personally disappointed that our projected growth rate for fiscal 2017 is not as strong as our past 3 years performance, I believe strongly that the strength of our long-term customer relationships and unique portfolio of integrated services is and always will remain a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical manufacturers and provider customers. Our management team shares my passion and drive for producing strong and sustainable growth results while also delivering outstanding customer service. In the years ahead, we will continue to serve our industry with the same high level of discipline that we have demonstrated throughout the 15-year history of ABC in our legacy-formative companies. We provide a vital service in the global healthcare system, and we do so with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients while delivering balanced, long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Tim."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results.
As Steve mentioned, it was a challenging year in our industry and for ABC with the changing pharmaceutical pricing dynamics that we continue to work through. Overall, we did not finish exactly where we thought we would at the beginning of the year, but we successfully navigated a tough environment.
There's a lot to like about our fiscal '16. Let me spend a minute and cover a few key highlights. Most noteworthy would be the drug company's successful acquisition and integration of PharMEDium. We are very pleased with the results of the -- the business has delivered, and we are also pleased with the new talent and skill sets the PharMEDium employees bring to ABC. The second item, our ABSG specialty business had a very impressive year, with revenues passing $28 billion, and they achieved record operating income. And finally, we exit the fiscal year with improved balance sheet, and importantly, we successfully mitigated all of the potential dilution from the shares issued to Walgreens as a result of the warrant exercises. It's great to have the warrants officially behind us. This will simplify our reporting going forward.
This morning, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. And I will wrap up covering our fiscal '17 expectations. Let's begin our Q4 review. Our revenues increased roughly $2 billion to $37.6 billion, up 6%. Operating income, our adjusted operating income was $464 million, up $7 million or 2%. We certainly benefited from our operating expenses being down by 3%.
We've made a concerted effort through various cost initiatives to reduce expenses throughout ABC. This offset our gross profit being down in both dollars and percentage.
Moving below the operating income line, income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.4% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. I should highlight that our quarterly tax expense included a slight year-to-date adjustment to bring our full year tax rate to 32.5%. This rate is just below the tax rate we had previously guided to as a result of slightly higher international income and favorable discrete tax adjustments we made closing out our fiscal year.
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.30. Let me highlight, we finished fiscal year '16 with 220 million outstanding common shares. Please remember that the 220 million outstanding shares is before the dilutive impact from share-based compensation. When combined, this number is used to calculate our diluted earnings per share going forward.
Next, let me cover our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $36 billion, up 6%. Our Drug Company had solid revenue growth, up 5%. I should highlight that we continue to lap very strong hepatitis C revenues from the prior year, and this created a headwind in the current quarter of roughly 1.5%.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had revenue growth of just over 15%. The business has now anniversary-d the addition of a 3PL customer that has been enhancing revenue growth over the last year. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see especially strong revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs, growing in the high teens and as a percentage. Lastly, I should highlight that this quarter was another record revenue quarter for our ABSG business.
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $785 million, down just about 1%. We saw solid gross profit dollar growth in our specialty business due to higher revenues. Our drug company's gross profit was down versus last year even with the addition of PharMEDium. We had the impact from 2 contract renewals with anchored customers: Kaiser, which took effect on July 1; and also CPA, our largest independent buying group customer.
There is strategic importance in signing these large, fast-growing customers to longer-term contracts. However, in the 12 months following the resigning, the change in economics to bring the contract to the appropriate market price can be a meaningful headwind. Also, during the current quarter, we had a lower contribution from drug price inflation. These were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit dollars in our drug company business.
Segment operating expenses were $391 million and were down versus the prior year by 3% or about $14 million. Both the drug company and ABSG continue to closely manage their cost structures to ensure they are spending in the right areas. On a comparable basis to last year, so excluding the impact from PharMEDium, the segment's OpEx would have been down nearly 7%.
Adjusted segment operating income was $394 million, which is up 1%. Solid performance by our specialty group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the drug company.
We can now move to the -- to our Other segment, which includes MWI, our Patient Services consulting business and World Courier. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 5%. Both our consulting and World Courier businesses had solid revenue growth in the quarter. Our MWI business was a little lower in terms of revenue growth this quarter due to a combination of 2 things: an impact from foreign currency from the U.K. business; and an impact also from some expected seasonality in the U.S. business. Let me point out, we continue to be very pleased with the U.S. companion animal side of the business, which had growth of nearly 6%. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $70 million, up 4%.
The growth is after year-end compensation [indiscernible] of true-ups in all 3 businesses. Additionally, our consulting business is deep into their new ERP system implementation. Certain expenses that can't be capitalized negatively impacted the segment. These 2 items essentially reduced the growth rate by slightly more than half this quarter.
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal year 2016 financial metrics.
Revenue. Our full year growth was a very good 8%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues. ABSG, our specialty business, finished the year at $28.5 billion, with revenue growth of 17%. Just an outstanding year for this business.
Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to just over $2 billion.
EPS. Our full-year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.62, up 14% due primarily to our operating income growth, mostly from our ABSG business and also having MWI for a full fiscal year.
Our drug company had a challenging year, with the negative impacts from contract renewals and industry drug pricing headwinds, but the benefit from PharMEDium helped to offset these items.
Free Cash flow. We had a terrific finish to our fiscal year. We ended at $2.7 billion of free cash flow. Our fourth quarter was much better than previously anticipated due to higher revenues and certain one-time working capital benefits at ABSG as well as a greater-than-expected positive impact from ending our year on a Friday, which is our best cash receipts day.
Now let's turn to fiscal '17 expectations. Before I start working through specific guidance items, I will make some overarching comments. Importantly, we have not included any impact to our P&L and cash flow from our largest customer, Walgreens, successfully completing their acquisition of Rite Aid. In light of the current pharmaceutical market dynamics, I want to comment on 3 key working assumptions. First, let's start with brand drug pricing. During fiscal '16, our brand inflation rate finished right at 10%. We did see some further moderation from the 10% during September, and it has continued through October. So as we think about fiscal '17, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to a range of 7% to 9%.
Lowering this range translates to a gross profit headwind to our fiscal '17 growth targets.
The next period where we traditionally see a high level of announcement activity will be during the month of January. Consequently, we have a period of time before we know how we are tracking against this assumption.
Next, generic drug pricing. We continue to expect a contribution from a modest level of price increases. But overall, our generic drug basket is expected to deflate in the 7% to 9% range during fiscal '17. This rate is consistent with what we experienced the second half of fiscal '16, and importantly, recent trends in the market indicate that the generic deflation rate has not improved, unfortunately.
In fiscal '17, the generic deflation rate will be a gross profit headwind for the entire fiscal year as opposed to just a partial year in fiscal '16. And finally, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-to-year.
We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal '17. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the range of 6.5% to 8%. While the decrease in the rate of brand drug inflation will weigh on our drug company's revenue growth, we expect our ABSG specialty business to grow slightly above 10%.
In the Other segment, we expect revenues to grow between 7% and 8%.
Consolidated gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but to repeat previous commentary, our drug company business will have a significant gross profit headwind from 2 key customer contract renewals: CPA through the first 2 quarters of fiscal '17; and Kaiser, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17.
Consolidated operating expenses. We expect the growth rate in this area of roughly 6% to 7% in fiscal '17. On past calls, we've noted that we are incurring incremental operating expenses related to strategic systems and technology we are implementing across the organization. Since these systems are all fairly significant in size and scope, most will be implemented while running parallel with existing systems. Let me also point out that our drug company is underway with a large capital project that will both upgrade and also expand capacity in their distribution center network, due in part to our expectation that eventually, we will serve the Rite Aid stores on behalf of Walgreens.
We are currently building 7 new distribution centers, 2 of these are incremental to the network while the remaining 5 are relocations to larger, more modern facilities. As a reference point, the 5 relocations so the DCs that are being replaced average 32 years in service life. Mostly this -- most of the associated dollars spent will be capitalized -- excuse me. However, this is also the same situation where we expect to incur duplicate expenses as we operate both the new and old distribution centers for a period of time.
These IT systems and infrastructure investments support our growth, improve the customer experience and ultimately, increase our operating efficiency. However, there is a negative impact to our fiscal '17 operating expense growth rate of a couple of percentage points.
Consolidated adjusted operating income. We expect ABC operating income dollars to be in the range of down slightly to up 4%. This is driven by our drug company having EBIT that is flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We do expect good organic growth in our ABSG business but not enough to offset the lower growth in the drug company and the gross profit headwinds I called out previously. We expect the Other segment to grow EBIT in the high single-digit percentage range.
Switching to operating margin. We expect consolidated margin to be down 5 to 10 basis points due primarily to mix of business so large customers growing faster; and the impacts from our large contract renewals.
Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 33%.
Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes modest share buybacks, enough to offset the dilutive impact from equity incentives. We are pleased that we are able to announce this morning in our earnings release our new $1 billion share authorization. We now have capacity of about $1.1 billion. As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment, depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions.
Adjusted EPS. Over the last few months, unpredictability around pharmaceutical pricing has increased. Therefore, we are lowering our expected fiscal '17 EPS growth rates and also widening the range until such time that we have more clarity on these pharmaceutical pricing dynamics, both brand inflation and the rate of generic drug deflation. Consequently, we expect our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.63 to $5.88. The growth rate range is now flat to up 5% over our fiscal year '16 adjusted EPS of $5.62. Also, please note that we have not included any financial impact from the implementation of Medicare Part B demonstration project in our adjusted EPS guidance. It's quite possible the Part B demo project will be delayed, altered or even litigated.
Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression given the 2 large headwinds I called out previously, the 2 key contract renewals and moderating brand drug price inflation. We expect that our Q1 '17 adjusted EPS would be several cents below our actual results from Q1 '16. We also expect Q2 to be relatively flat to last year's results. We expect to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year as we cycle through these headwinds and have easier comparables.
Switching to cash flow. First, CapEx is expected to be slightly higher in fiscal '17 when compared to fiscal '16. It's likely we will reach $500 million due to the heavy capital investment underway, funding both the new IT systems and distribution centers.
Debt repayments. We do have a $600 million note that will mature in May 2017. The proceeds from this note will be used to partially fund the repurchases of shares under our special share program. Now that the warrants are completed, it's our intent to repay this note at maturity.
Free cash flow. We'd now expect our free cash flow with fiscal '17 to be at or slightly above our adjusted net income. The expected year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to the following discrete items: one, the cash timing benefit we received from ending the year on a Friday. This benefit won't repeat. We estimate this impact to be roughly $500 million. Two, the continued investment in working capital with Walgreens; and three, certain one-time working capital improvements at our ABSG business that won't repeat in fiscal '17.
As I wrap up, I know that both Steve and my comments were especially long this morning due to covering several important topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention.
I'd like to personally thank the ABC team for all the efforts made this year, delivering solid results in a challenging time for the industry. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, but the challenging times are still with us. With our outstanding customer portfolio, our ability to execute in our financial resources, we are confident we will be able to continually adapt to working in a dynamic environment, and most importantly, delivering compelling, long-term shareholder value.
We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

I mean, my comments on -- are, I think, very appropriate for AmerisourceBergen. I can't talk about the others, but we would say that the market is competitive but rational. It's always been that way. The environment is probably more challenging, and I think that's a function of customer consolidation. You got a lot going on, on the M&A side, with key provider customers coming together, key manufacturers coming together. Everyone's facing cost and efficiency challenges, and I would say our customers are more consolidated, more informed and have always been very sophisticated and quite adept at demanding value from us. And I think our industry is being responsive. And maybe we just haven't had as many tailwinds as we usually have, but I think the environment is essentially the same as it's been from a competitive perspective for many, many years. And we pointed in my script towards working within our customer base, so I think that's a key point for us and getting more compliance from those relationships. Tim, you want to add anything?"

We said 7% to 9%, but I'm just saying within 1% or 2%. If it comes a lot below that, we think that, that will create some challenges that we will address. But we don't think that, that's possible in the next 12 months. Tim, would you agree with that, anything to add?"

I came into the drug company in 2009, and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in Specialty, we often -- the wholesaler's usually owned or we're very involved in -- at least in oncology, with our buying groups, and the same is true of, say, basic medical. So this is a function of the market, and for the most part, we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups that's gotten really dug [ph] in. CPA is a very good example. So as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We sourced some contracts where we were getting high teens in our generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing and how that's going to change, I would say, a 9-year contract that we have with CPA. you have to be cognizant of that. You have to be thoughtful of that because ABC's always thinking about the long-term and what does that 9-year contract look like, and just because in the last 9 years, contracts have been variably improved, that doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same way. Then that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We can buy. Some of those are going to be very important new therapies. And that's a lot how we're thinking about things. I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics and then it's an important question, so I'll let Tim also comment. But as the group's consolidated, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts, but it's an independent practice. We would say that 2000 are very important, very critical, and they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well.

I think it's always interesting, lose a relationships with the -- and I think it's a shared relationship between a buying group and a wholesaler. So that's why having that -- long-term contracts is extremely important so that we can work together on what the collaborative approach that I referred to in my script. So I think actually that last is a pretty good example of that, and it probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC and -- but not -- just one of those things that happened. I wouldn't say that, that pointed to some acute level of competition or anything or any of this drama that we've heard about a price war. So the incremental share that we've had in independence is very -- I think, we just are making sure that we're holding ground with those new contracts we signed. And we did work to try to keep some of those former customer, buying group customers that had switched to a new wholesaler. We did work to keep them with ABC, but kept that in line with overall market because again, if people talk to each other in an efficient market, so we're going to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced. And then the telemarketers, I would say, are struggling a bit because I think our sales and our peer companies are looking at their compliance factor and have better tools to manage that, and it's not the growth that you have from so many new product launches. I've talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting any product out upon a patent expiration fast enough, we're covering that. So we're saying to our customers, no need for you to order from a telemarketer, we're going to get that product to you first, and that's one of the examples, Eric, of an enhancement we make in our business.

There's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market base fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult times, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers. So we worked hard. I think we called out this trend, and we're working hard, and we'll continue to work hard to make sure that those specialty products that are such an important waiting mix within the portfolio of services that we provide, that those products are popular, and that is a recognition that you're not going to get as high a fee-for-service, so it should be a differentiated brand mark down to respond directly to your question."

It is tr",3067,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone.
Before I begin my comments on AmerisourceBergen's performance, I would like to start by directly addressing some of the recent comments regarding competition in the Pharmaceutical Distribution market. It is true that customers and manufacturers are acquiring more value today than ever before, but that is to be expected in a health care landscape, where both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers are facing increasing cost pressures and constant demands to demonstrate the value of the products and services we provide.
Our manufacturing provide our customers exceptional service levels and innovative solutions and have the good fortune of being able to choose between 3 extremely competent and high-quality wholesalers. While we each differentiate ourselves in specific ways, we are all very tied to our core supply-chain businesses with our own unique mixes of services, segment orientations and key customers, all of which will invariably lead to some differences in growth rates in spite of our sharing a common macro environment.
While it is true that we have said we expect our revenue growth to exceed the overall market growth rate, that growth is driven by our outstanding mix of customers, many of who are expected to grow faster than the market, and by our footprint in specialty, which also grows faster than the overall market. These 2 elements provide the organic growth that is the primary driver of our business. We take the selection and development of our customers very seriously, as we believe those relationships are the foundation upon which our business is raised. In addition, the collaborative relationships we have built and the long term contracts we have signed with our key provider customers give us real confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
I do believe our relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is truly unique. No other wholesaler serves all the prescription needs and partners so comprehensively on supply chain as we do with WBA and WBAD. This year, our relationship continues to flourish, and we all believe there's more important, meaningful and profitable work left to accomplish. We look forward to facing the future with WBA as a strong and aligned partner.
I think it is also important to clarify our view of independent pharmacy market specifically. This has always been an important franchise for AmerisourceBergen, and we have spent a lot of time communicating in our past releases and investor conference discussions, the investments we are making in Good Neighbor Pharmacy, business coaching, pro-generics and our third-party network, Elevate. Like all investments that we make, we expect that these investments should provide us a return. Specifically with independence, we are striving for improved compliance and share of wallet for our contracted customer base. We have deliberately chosen to work more with our established and proven relationships than to go and win new relationships that are not profitable or strategically relevant to our offering. An example of the deeper, more enduring relationships we have with independent customers is the 9-year exclusive relationship we signed this fiscal year with CPA, our largest independent buying group. This important customer is an innovator in their own right and has partnered with us for the long term because they share our vision for the future of community pharmacy.
It is also important to remember that we have now anniversary-ed the last of the independent buying group customer we called out in September of 2015. Since that time, we have worked hard to keep or win back some of the stores that were part of that buying group by rolling out significant enhancements to our key programs and services for our independent customers. As we have said, it took longer for those activities to gain traction than we would have liked, but we are pleased with the progress we have made. In addition to those activities, we have made a deliberate effort to protect our market share with existing customers and to put -- increase our rates of penetration with those customers, primarily by reducing leakage, especially on generic products. As the share number of generic products has increased over the last several years, the sourcing opportunities that customers have had to acquire generic products also increased. As a result, we have had to work very diligently, not only to grow our share of wallet with each of our customers, but also to protect that share against the lure of short-term opportunities.
Some of those opportunities invariably arise outside of a formal RFP process or from nontraditional competitors like telemarketing companies. Our philosophy has always been to protect and enhance the prime vendor relationships we have with our customers, which is a unique cornerstone of the U.S. distribution industry, especially when compared to other international models. Our customers have responded favorably to these initiatives because they see the value inherent in sourcing all of their products from ABC at a fair price.
I commend our leadership and our drug company associates for the challenging work that they have done in these areas. Specifically, I feel ABC has been very transparent with not only our customers but our suppliers and our investors about the need to look at different pricing strategies for specialty products in the retail, outpatient and alternate care markets, serviced by our core drug wholesale business. As we have said before, due to the cadence of different sales side contract expirations, these changes do not happen overnight. This philosophy is reflected in all the significant new long-term contracts we signed this fiscal year.
Moving onto our results. I'm pleased to now discuss, as I had originally planned to do at the outset of this call, the successful conclusion to our fiscal year 2016. Today, we are reporting solid performance in our September quarter. We met the goals and objectives we laid out for our business in early May. Revenues were up 6% and adjusted EPS was up 12%.
We have made significant progress in addressing the challenging environment our core business faces, and certain other areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group has also continued its strong performance through the September quarter.
In fiscal year 2016, we grew our revenues 8% to nearly $147 billion; grew our adjusted diluted EPS 14% to $5.62; and generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion.
Over the course of the year, we improved our balance sheet, repurchased over $700 million of stock under our regular program and successfully mitigated the dilutive impact of an exercise of the 2 tranches of warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our strategic long-term relationship. Our solid operational performance and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2016 have provided us with significant financial flexibility heading into fiscal 2017. Over the course of my 5 years as CEO, I'm very proud that the company grew revenues at a compounded annual rate of 13%, which drove an EPS CAGR of 16% over the same period. We've grown the business in a variety of different ways, including through making internal investments, through driving innovative partnerships with leading market-leading customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and by making thoughtful acquisitions to add to the capabilities and services we provide to help ensure we can continue to grow well into the future.
While we are looking ahead to a year that we expect will deliver growth somewhat below our historical rate of performance, I believe we have positioned ourselves well to work through the near-term headwinds and take advantage of  longer-term growth opportunities.
The investments we have made and the foundation we have built will serve us well as we navigate the complex and continuously evolving health care landscape. While the precise ways in which we generate earnings will change over time, I'm very confident that we will continue to drive growth because we provide an essential service to the global healthcare system and ultimately and most importantly, to patients. And we do so in an incredibly efficient and effective manner.
Let's turn now to the performance in our business units in the quarter. Our drug company had solid revenue growth of 5% and had good performance in all of its customer segments.
While our community pharmacy customers certainly face challenges in the rapidly changing environment, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. Patients are benefiting from the accessibility of pharmacy care and the expansion of healthcare offerings that are now being provided in community pharmacies. Tens of thousands of patients still turn to independent community pharmacy for all of their healthcare needs, and we are working to continue to expand upon that cornerstone of trusted healthcare.
I believe the programs we are offering at GNP and Elevate, among others, will continue to add value to this important segment and allow our customers to maintain their presence with their patients and the plans they service. This level of care demands a seamless integration of technology and personalized service, and our latest offerings in these areas continue to gain traction. We've also made meaningful improvements to our First to Shelf programs for new generic drug launches, and service levels in our pro generics program have never been higher. Having the enhanced ability to fulfill prescriptions for new generics immediately and to reliably meet patient demands for existing products are 2 of the most essential services community pharmacies provide. Even small improvements in these areas can help ensure that our customers are leaders in their local market and provide meaningful value to the patients they serve.
During the September quarter, we made additional progress in our efforts to evolve our customer contract strategies regarding brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. We are pleased that our customers are receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower-margin and higher-priced brand and specialty products and are open to finding workable solutions. While we will always have some contract renewals in any given year, most of the heavy lifting on large market-related adjustments required in our customer base is behind us, and we can now concentrate on the deeper and more robust collaborative work that comes from a shared partnership and a desire to create respectful, balanced relationships.
During our fiscal year '17, we anticipate and would hope to renew our contract relationship with Express Scripts. There are no other disclosable contracts we will be discussing. Partnering with key customers and developing lasting, sustainable relationships has been a primary strategic objective of AmerisourceBergen for the last several years. We knew the world would be changing quickly, and while we could not foresee every conceivable outcome, we believe that if we would partner with the right customers for the long term, we would be much better able to face the market challenges together. Being able to take a long view drives innovative thinking and is often the catalyst that unlocks the value that is obscured by uncertainty.
In addition to having the right customers, we need to make the right investments. A great example of this is PharMEDium, which had another strong quarter. We have almost reached the 1 year anniversary of the acquisition, and we could not be more pleased. Integration of PharMEDium has been seamless, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our health systems customers understand the value of the products and services that PharMEDium provides, but it is the quality of their compounded sterile IV preparations that enabled them to earn new business. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, hitting on all the important criteria we target for successful acquisitions culturally, strategically and financially, and we are very excited about the future potential of this business.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group once again had a strong quarter, with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs and have long championed patient access to specialty products. The economics of specialty products can vary depending on a few key factors: the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit; and the extent to which we could add value for the manufacturers and the provider. The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a trusted partner in nearly every aspect of bringing specialty products to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting on commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the markets for both innovative new therapies and for biosimilars. Our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is an oncology franchise, our plasma vaccine and physician office distribution businesses or our third party logistics business. Together, the group is the undisputed leader in enabling specialty products' success and is an essential partner for manufacturers, for providers and ultimately for the patients they serve.
This portfolio of offerings we have built will only become more important as the focus on value and cost efficiency increases. Just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians. Our network of oncology practices are very well-positioned for quality initiatives like oncology medical home, which improved overall value. Additionally, we continue to invest in our market-leading franchise of dispensing practices that are leveraging clinical integration and real-time care coordination within and beyond the practice to improve patient adherence and reduce side effects and waste.
As I said last quarter, the cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the risks associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms of Part B drugs and will do so in a way that is always patient-minded.
While being focused on some key technology deployments, our customer -- our patient services and consulting businesses also had a solid September quarter. The expertise we have in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Over the last couple of years, we have worked to expand the global reach of these businesses to further enhance our value proposition to manufacturers. As we mentioned previously, our Consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform will enable new possibilities for growth by driving innovation and expanding our capability to provide custom-tailored programs and services to our manufacturer customers.
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC, and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. They had solid results in the quarter and a very good year. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business, where organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. They've performed exceptionally well from an operational and financial perspective, and its management has made significant and ongoing contributions to the whole of ABC. Among the many reasons we are so enthused about the business is the operational synergies ABC has brought to MWI such as their recently implemented WMS system and some of our technologies which enhanced patient intimacy in community setting. Likewise, MWI has brought ABC opportunities for more comprehensive discussions with suppliers in an area where we are truly competitively differentiated. We expect to continue to invest in animal health business as it is an area which have only just begun to realize the full slate of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Tim will provide the details, but I wanted to comment on the -- our key expectations heading into next year. In fiscal 2017, we expect to grow revenues in the range of 6.5% to 8% and to grow adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range that is flat to up 5% over the prior year. Our growth expectations have come down somewhat due to the increased uncertainty around brand drug inflation and the rate of generic deflation. We do expect, however, to return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of our fiscal year as we anniversary the customer contract renewal headwinds and we begin to lap some of the impact of decreases in drug pricing.
It is also worth noting that assuming that Walgreens and Rite Aid receive FTC clearance, we anticipate that we will begin to service Rite Aid towards the end of the fiscal year, and we have been making investments to ensure we are well-positioned to continue to drive the quality, scale and efficiency that this incremental volume will require of us.
In summary, I have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. Despite unexpected headwinds in the year, the fact is we now just reported a 40% EPS increase year following on the heels of back-to-back 20%-plus growth years. While I'm personally disappointed that our projected growth rate for fiscal 2017 is not as strong as our past 3 years performance, I believe strongly that the strength of our long-term customer relationships and a unique portfolio of integrated services is and always will remain a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical manufacturers and provider customers. Our management team shares my passion and drive for producing strong and sustainable growth results while also delivering outstanding customer service. In the years ahead, we will continue to serve our industry with the same high level of discipline that we have demonstrated throughout the 15-year history of ABC in our legacy-formative companies. We provide a vital service in the global healthcare system, and we do so with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients while delivering balanced, long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Tim."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results.
As Steve mentioned, it was a challenging year in our industry and for ABC with the changing pharmaceutical pricing dynamics that we continue to work through. Overall, we did not finish exactly where we thought we would at the beginning of the year, but we successfully navigated a tough environment.
There's a lot to like about our fiscal '16. Let me spend a minute and cover a few key highlights. Most noteworthy would be the drug company's successful acquisition and integration of PharMEDium. We are very pleased with the results of the -- the business has delivered, and we are also pleased with the new talent and skill sets the PharMEDium employees bring to ABC. The second item, our ABSG specialty business had a very impressive year, with revenues passing $28 billion, and they achieved record operating income. And finally, we exit the fiscal year with improved balance sheet, and importantly, we successfully mitigated all of the potential dilution from the shares issued to Walgreens as a result of the warrant exercises. It's great to have the warrants officially behind us. This will simplify our reporting going forward.
This morning, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. And I will wrap up covering our fiscal '17 expectations. Let's begin our Q4 review. Our revenues increased roughly $2 billion to $37.6 billion, up 6%. Operating income,. Our adjusted operating income was $464 million, up $7 million or 2%. We certainly benefited from our operating expenses being down by 3%.
We've made a concerted effort through various cost initiatives to reduce expenses throughout ABC. This offset our gross profit being down in both dollars and percentage.
Moving below the operating income line. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.4% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. I should highlight that our quarterly tax expense included a slight year-to-date adjustment to bring our full year tax rate to 32.5%. This rate is just below the tax rate we had previously guided to as a result of slightly higher international income and favorable discrete tax adjustments we made closing out our fiscal year.
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.30. Let me highlight, we finished fiscal year '16 with 220 million outstanding common shares. Please remember that the 220 million outstanding shares is before the dilutive impact from share-based compensation. When combined, this number is used to calculate our diluted earnings per share going forward.
Next, let me cover our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $36 billion, up 6%. Our Drug Company had solid revenue growth, up 5%. I should highlight that we continue to lap very strong hepatitis C revenues from the prior year, and this created a headwind in the current quarter of roughly 1.5%.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had revenue growth of just over 15%. The business has now anniversary-ed the addition of a 3PL customer that has been enhancing revenue growth over the last year. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see especially strong revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs, growing in the high teens as a percentage. Lastly, I should highlight that this quarter was another record revenue quarter for our ABSG business.
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $785 million, down just about 1%. We saw solid gross profit dollar growth in our specialty business due to higher revenues. Our drug company's gross profit was down versus last year even with the addition of PharMEDium. We had the impact from 2 contract renewals with anchor customers: Kaiser, which took effect on July 1; and also CPA, our largest independent buying group customer.
There is strategic importance in signing these large, fast-growing customers to longer-term contracts. However, in the 12 months following the re-signing, the change in economics to bring the contract to the appropriate market price can be a meaningful headwind. Also, during the current quarter, we had a lower contribution from drug price inflation. These were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit dollars in our drug company business.
Segment operating expenses were $391 million and were down versus the prior year by 3% or about $14 million. Both the drug company and ABSG continue to closely manage their cost structures to ensure they are spending in the right areas. On a comparable basis to last year, so excluding the impact from PharMEDium, the segment's OpEx would have been down nearly 7%.
Adjusted segment operating income was $394 million, which is up 1%. Solid performance by our specialty group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the drug company.
We can now move to the -- to our Other segment, which includes MWI, our Patient Services consulting business; and World Courier. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 5%. Both our consulting and World Courier businesses had solid revenue growth in the quarter. Our MWI business was a little lower in terms of revenue growth this quarter due to a combination of 2 things: an impact from foreign currency from the U.K. business; and an impact also from some expected seasonality in the U.S. business. Let me point out, we continue to be very pleased with the U.S. companion animal side of the business, which had growth of nearly 6%. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $70 million, up 4%.
The growth is after year-end compensation and incentive true-ups in all 3 businesses. Additionally, our consulting business is deep into their new ERP system implementation. Certain expenses that can't be capitalized negatively impacted the segment. These 2 items essentially reduced the growth rate by slightly more than half this quarter.
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal year 2016 financial metrics.
Revenue. Our full year growth was a very good 8%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues. ABSG, our specialty business, finished the year at $28.5 billion, with revenue growth of 17%. Just an outstanding year for this business.
Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to just over $2 billion.
EPS. Our full-year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.62, up 14% due primarily to our operating income growth, mostly from our ABSG business and also having MWI for a full fiscal year.
Our drug company had a challenging year, with the negative impacts from contract renewals and industry drug pricing headwinds, but the benefit from PharMEDium helped to offset these items.
Free Cash flow. We had a terrific finish to our fiscal year. We ended at $2.7 billion of free cash flow. Our fourth quarter was much better than previously anticipated due to higher revenues and certain onetime working capital benefits at ABSG as well as a greater-than-expected positive impact from ending our year on a Friday, which is our best cash receipts day.
Now let's turn to fiscal '17 expectations. Before I start working through specific guidance items, I will make some overarching comments. Importantly, we have not included any impact to our P&L and cash flow from our largest customer, Walgreens, successfully completing their acquisition of Rite Aid. In light of the current pharmaceutical market dynamics, I want to comment on 3 key working assumptions. First, let's start with brand drug pricing. During fiscal '16, our brand inflation rate finished right at 10%. We did see some further moderation from the 10% during September, and it has continued through October. So as we think about fiscal '17, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to a range of 7% to 9%.
Lowering this range translates to a gross profit headwind to our fiscal '17 growth targets.
The next period where we traditionally see a high level of announcement activity will be during the month of January. Consequently, we have a period of time before we know how we are tracking against this assumption.
Next, generic drug pricing. We continue to expect a contribution from a modest level of price increases. But overall, our generic drug basket is expected to deflate in the 7% to 9% range during fiscal '17. This rate is consistent with what we experienced the second half of fiscal '16, and importantly, recent trends in the market indicate that the generic deflation rate has not improved, unfortunately.
In fiscal '17, the generic deflation rate will be a gross profit headwind for the entire fiscal year as opposed to just a partial year in fiscal '16. And finally, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-to-year.
We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal '17. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the range of 6.5% to 8%. While the decrease in the rate of brand drug inflation will weigh on our drug company's revenue growth, we expect our ABSG specialty business to grow slightly above 10%.
In the Other segment, we expect revenues to grow between 7% and 8%.
Consolidated gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but to repeat previous commentary, our drug company business will have a significant gross profit headwind from 2 key customer contract renewals: CPA through the first 2 quarters of fiscal '17; and Kaiser, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17.
Consolidated operating expenses. We expect a growth rate in this area of roughly 6% to 7% in fiscal '17. On past calls, we've noted that we are incurring incremental operating expenses related to strategic systems and technology we are implementing across the organization. Since these systems are all fairly significant in size and scope, most will be implemented while running parallel with existing systems. Let me also point out that our drug company is under way with a large capital project that will both upgrade and also expand capacity in their distribution center network, due in part to our expectation that eventually, we will serve the Rite Aid stores on behalf of Walgreens.
We are currently building 7 new distribution centers; 2 of these are incremental to the network while the remaining 5 are relocations to larger, more modern facilities. As a reference point, the 5 relocations, so the DCs that are being replaced, average 32 years in service life. Mostly this -- most of the associated dollars spent will be capitalized -- excuse me. However, this is also the same situation where we expect to incur duplicate expenses as we operate both the new and old distribution centers for a period of time.
These IT systems and infrastructure investments support our growth, improve the customer experience and, ultimately, increase our operating efficiency. However, there is a negative impact to our fiscal '17 operating expense growth rate of a couple of percentage points.
Consolidated adjusted operating income. We expect ABC operating income dollars to be in the range of down slightly to up 4%. This is driven by our drug company having EBIT that is flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We do expect good organic growth in our ABSG business but not enough to offset the lower growth in the drug company, with the gross profit headwinds I called out previously. We expect the Other segment to grow EBIT in the high single-digit percentage range.
Switching to operating margin. We expect consolidated margin to be down 5 to 10 basis points due primarily to mix of business, so large customers growing faster; and the impacts from our large contract renewals.
Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 33%.
Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes modest share buybacks, enough to offset the dilutive impact from equity incentives. We are pleased that we are able to announce this morning in our earnings release our new $1 billion share authorization. We now have capacity of about $1.1 billion. As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment, depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions.
Adjusted EPS. Over the last few months, unpredictability around pharmaceutical pricing has increased. Therefore, we are lowering our expected fiscal '17 EPS growth rates and also widening the range until such time that we have more clarity on these pharmaceutical pricing dynamics, both brand inflation and the rate of generic drug deflation. Consequently, we expect our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.63 to $5.88. The growth rate range is now flat to up 5% over our fiscal year '16 adjusted EPS of $5.62. Also, please note that we have not included any financial impact from the implementation of Medicare Part B demonstration project in our adjusted EPS guidance. It's quite possible the Part B demo project will be delayed, altered or even litigated.
Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression given the 2 large headwinds I called out previously, the 2 key contract renewals and moderating brand drug price inflation. We expect that our Q1 '17 adjusted EPS would be several cents below our actual results from Q1 '16. We also expect Q2 to be relatively flat to last year's results. We expect to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year as we cycle through these headwinds and have easier comparables.
Switching to cash flow. First, CapEx is expected to be slightly higher in fiscal '17 when compared to fiscal '16. It's likely we will reach $500 million due to the heavy capital investment under way, funding both the new IT systems and distribution centers.
Debt repayments. We do have a $600 million note that will mature in May 2017. The proceeds from this note were used to partially fund the repurchases of shares under our special share program. Now that the warrants are completed, it's our intent to repay this note at maturity.
Free cash flow. We now expect our free cash flow with fiscal '17 to be at or slightly above our adjusted net income. The expected year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to the following discrete items: one, the cash timing benefit we received from ending the year on a Friday. This benefit won't repeat. We estimate this impact to be roughly $500 million. Two, the continued investment in working capital with Walgreens; and three, certain onetime working capital improvements at our ABSG business that won't repeat in fiscal '17.
As I wrap up, I know that both Steve and my comments were especially long this morning due to covering several important topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention.
I'd like to personally thank the ABC team for all the efforts made this year, delivering solid results in a challenging time for the industry. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, but the challenging times are still with us. With our outstanding customer portfolio, our ability to execute in our financial resources, we are confident we will be able to continually adapt to working in a dynamic environment, and most importantly, delivering compelling, long-term shareholder value.
We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

I mean, my comments on -- are, I think, very appropriate for AmerisourceBergen. I can't talk about the others, but we would say that the market is competitive but rational. It's always been that way. The environment is probably more challenging, and I think that's a function of customer consolidation. You've got a lot going on, on the M&A side, with key provider customers coming together, key manufacturers coming together. Everyone's facing cost and efficiency challenges, and I would say our customers are more consolidated, more informed and have always been very sophisticated and quite adept at demanding value from us. And I think our industry is being responsive. And maybe we just haven't had as many tailwinds as we usually have, but I think the environment is essentially the same as it's been from a competitive perspective for many, many years. And we pointed in my script towards working within our customer base, so I think that's a key point for us and getting more compliance from those relationships. Tim, you want to add anything?"

I came into the drug company in 2009, and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in Specialty, we often -- the wholesalers usually owned or we're very involved in -- at least in oncology, with our buying groups, and the same is true of, say, basic medical. So this is a function of the market, and for the most part, we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups . That's gotten really dug in. CPA is a very good example. So as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We saw some contracts where we were getting high teens in our generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing and how that's going to change over, say, a 9-year contract that we have with CPA. You have to be cognizant of that. You have to be thoughtful of that because ABC's always thinking about the long-term and what does that 9-year contract look like, and just because in the last 9 years, contracts have been variably improved, that doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same way. Then that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We think biosimilars are going to be very important, new therapies. And that's a lot of how we're thinking about things. I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics and then it's an important question, so I'll let Tim also comment. But as the group's consolidated, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts, but it's an independent practice. We would say that 2000 are very important, very critical, and they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well. So those are the sort of discussions that we think are important, but they're not new. They've been going on for a long time. Any comments?"

I guess, the broader question from that is you said better to maximize compliance than go after incremental share. Were there any other areas where you became incrementally more aggressive? And then third, your comment on telemarketers and other competition. Do you see the competition in the marketplace where it has increased from the other large-scale distributors? Or do you think there are more interlopers playing a larger role?"

I'll make a quick comment on each of those 3. We did lose a buying group customer. It was a customer where a lot of the members were GNP members. And a lot of them chose to stay with us, but I don't want to get too much into specifics. It's not that",401,"Yes. I'll make a quick comment on each of those 3. We did lose a buying group customer. It was a customer where a lot of the members were GNP members. And a lot of them chose to stay with us, but I don't want to get too much into specifics. It's not that overall material. I think it's always interesting, lose a relationships with the -- and I think it's a shared relationship between a buying group and a wholesaler. So that's why having that -- long-term contracts is extremely important so that we can work together on what the collaborative approach that I referred to in my script. So I think actually that last year is a pretty good example of that, and it probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC and -- but not -- just one of those things that happened. I wouldn't say that, that pointed to some acute level of competition or anything or any of this drama that we've heard about a price war. So the incremental share that we've had in independence is very -- I think, we just are making sure that we're holding ground with those new contracts we signed. And we did work to try to keep some of those former customers, buying group customers, that had switched to a new wholesaler. We did work to keep them with ABC, but kept that in line with overall market because again, if people talk to each other in an efficient market, so we're going to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced. And then the telemarketers, I would say, are struggling a bit because I think our sales and our peer companies are looking at their compliance factor and have better tools to manage that, and it's not the growth that you have from so many new product launches. I've talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting any product out upon a patent expiration fast enough, we're covering that. So we're saying to our customers, ""No need for you to order from a telemarketer; we're going to get that product to you first,"" and that's one of the examples, Eric, of an enhancement we make in our business. I think, Tim, I covered everything. So why don't we move on to the next question."

And then, we had that really fall off and specialty products increased so much, which are very expensive and there's an argument with the manufacturer. There's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market base fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult times, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers. So we worked hard. I think we called out this trend, and we're working hard and will continue to work hard to make sure that those specialty products that are such an important waiting mix within the portfolio of services that we provide, that those products are popular, and that is a recognition that you're not going to get as high a fee-for-service, so it should be a differentiated brand mark down to respond directly to your question."

It is tr",3067,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone.
Before I begin my comments on AmerisourceBergen's performance, I would like to start by directly addressing some of the recent comments regarding competition in the Pharmaceutical Distribution market. It is true that customers and manufacturers are acquiring more value today than ever before, but that is to be expected in a health care landscape, where both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers are facing increasing cost pressures and constant demands to demonstrate the value of the products and services we provide.
Our manufacturing provide our customers exceptional service levels and innovative solutions and have the good fortune of being able to choose between 3 extremely competent and high-quality wholesalers. While we each differentiate ourselves in specific ways, we are all very tied to our core supply-chain businesses with our own unique mixes of services, segment orientations and key customers, all of which will invariably lead to some differences in growth rates in spite of our sharing a common macro environment.
While it is true that we have said we expect our revenue growth to exceed the overall market growth rate, that growth is driven by our outstanding mix of customers, many of who are expected to grow faster than the market, and by our footprint in specialty, which also grows faster than the overall market. These 2 elements provide the organic growth that is the primary driver of our business. We take the selection and development of our customers very seriously, as we believe those relationships are the foundation upon which our business is raised. In addition, the collaborative relationships we have built and the long term contracts we have signed with our key provider customers give us real confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders for many years to come.
I do believe our relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance is truly unique. No other wholesaler serves all the prescription needs and partners so comprehensively on supply chain as we do with WBA and WBAD. This year, our relationship continues to flourish, and we all believe there's more important, meaningful and profitable work left to accomplish. We look forward to facing the future with WBA as a strong and aligned partner.
I think it is also important to clarify our view of independent pharmacy market specifically. This has always been an important franchise for AmerisourceBergen, and we have spent a lot of time communicating in our past releases and investor conference discussions, the investments we are making in Good Neighbor Pharmacy, business coaching, pro-generics and our third-party network, Elevate. Like all investments that we make, we expect that these investments should provide us a return. Specifically with independence, we are striving for improved compliance and share of wallet for our contracted customer base. We have deliberately chosen to work more with our established and proven relationships than to go and win new relationships that are not profitable or strategically relevant to our offering. An example of the deeper, more enduring relationships we have with independent customers is the 9-year exclusive relationship we signed this fiscal year with CPA, our largest independent buying group. This important customer is an innovator in their own right and has partnered with us for the long term because they share our vision for the future of community pharmacy.
It is also important to remember that we have now anniversary-ed the last of the independent buying group customer we called out in September of 2015. Since that time, we have worked hard to keep or win back some of the stores that were part of that buying group by rolling out significant enhancements to our key programs and services for our independent customers. As we have said, it took longer for those activities to gain traction than we would have liked, but we are pleased with the progress we have made. In addition to those activities, we have made a deliberate effort to protect our market share with existing customers and to put -- increase our rates of penetration with those customers, primarily by reducing leakage, especially on generic products. As the share number of generic products has increased over the last several years, the sourcing opportunities that customers have had to acquire generic products also increased. As a result, we have had to work very diligently, not only to grow our share of wallet with each of our customers, but also to protect that share against the lure of short-term opportunities.
Some of those opportunities invariably arise outside of a formal RFP process or from nontraditional competitors like telemarketing companies. Our philosophy has always been to protect and enhance the prime vendor relationships we have with our customers, which is a unique cornerstone of the U.S. distribution industry, especially when compared to other international models. Our customers have responded favorably to these initiatives because they see the value inherent in sourcing all of their products from ABC at a fair price.
I commend our leadership and our drug company associates for the challenging work that they have done in these areas. Specifically, I feel ABC has been very transparent with not only our customers but our suppliers and our investors about the need to look at different pricing strategies for specialty products in the retail, outpatient and alternate care markets, serviced by our core drug wholesale business. As we have said before, due to the cadence of different sales side contract expirations, these changes do not happen overnight. This philosophy is reflected in all the significant new long-term contracts we signed this fiscal year.
Moving onto our results. I'm pleased to now discuss, as I had originally planned to do at the outset of this call, the successful conclusion to our fiscal year 2016. Today, we are reporting solid performance in our September quarter. We met the goals and objectives we laid out for our business in early May. Revenues were up 6% and adjusted EPS was up 12%.
We have made significant progress in addressing the challenging environment our core business faces, and certain other areas of our business continue to perform very well, including our most recent acquisitions, MWI Veterinary Supply and PharMEDium. Our Specialty Group has also continued its strong performance through the September quarter.
In fiscal year 2016, we grew our revenues 8% to nearly $147 billion; grew our adjusted diluted EPS 14% to $5.62; and generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion.
Over the course of the year, we improved our balance sheet, repurchased over $700 million of stock under our regular program and successfully mitigated the dilutive impact of an exercise of the 2 tranches of warrants that were issued to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our strategic long-term relationship. Our solid operational performance and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2016 have provided us with significant financial flexibility heading into fiscal 2017. Over the course of my 5 years as CEO, I'm very proud that the company grew revenues at a compounded annual rate of 13%, which drove an EPS CAGR of 16% over the same period. We've grown the business in a variety of different ways, including through making internal investments, through driving innovative partnerships with leading market-leading customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and by making thoughtful acquisitions to add to the capabilities and services we provide to help ensure we can continue to grow well into the future.
While we are looking ahead to a year that we expect will deliver growth somewhat below our historical rate of performance, I believe we have positioned ourselves well to work through the near-term headwinds and take advantage of  longer-term growth opportunities.
The investments we have made and the foundation we have built will serve us well as we navigate the complex and continuously evolving health care landscape. While the precise ways in which we generate earnings will change over time, I'm very confident that we will continue to drive growth because we provide an essential service to the global healthcare system and ultimately and most importantly, to patients. And we do so in an incredibly efficient and effective manner.
Let's turn now to the performance in our business units in the quarter. Our drug company had solid revenue growth of 5% and had good performance in all of its customer segments.
While our community pharmacy customers certainly face challenges in the rapidly changing environment, I truly believe that this is a time of tremendous opportunity for independent pharmacy. Patients are benefiting from the accessibility of pharmacy care and the expansion of healthcare offerings that are now being provided in community pharmacies. Tens of thousands of patients still turn to independent community pharmacy for all of their healthcare needs, and we are working to continue to expand upon that cornerstone of trusted healthcare.
I believe the programs we are offering at GNP and Elevate, among others, will continue to add value to this important segment and allow our customers to maintain their presence with their patients and the plans they service. This level of care demands a seamless integration of technology and personalized service, and our latest offerings in these areas continue to gain traction. We've also made meaningful improvements to our First to Shelf programs for new generic drug launches, and service levels in our pro generics program have never been higher. Having the enhanced ability to fulfill prescriptions for new generics immediately and to reliably meet patient demands for existing products are 2 of the most essential services community pharmacies provide. Even small improvements in these areas can help ensure that our customers are leaders in their local market and provide meaningful value to the patients they serve.
During the September quarter, we made additional progress in our efforts to evolve our customer contract strategies regarding brand and specialty products to better reflect changing market conditions. We are pleased that our customers are receptive to the dialogue about the changing mix towards lower-margin and higher-priced brand and specialty products and are open to finding workable solutions. While we will always have some contract renewals in any given year, most of the heavy lifting on large market-related adjustments required in our customer base is behind us, and we can now concentrate on the deeper and more robust collaborative work that comes from a shared partnership and a desire to create respectful, balanced relationships.
During our fiscal year '17, we anticipate and would hope to renew our contract relationship with Express Scripts. There are no other disclosable contracts we will be discussing. Partnering with key customers and developing lasting, sustainable relationships has been a primary strategic objective of AmerisourceBergen for the last several years. We knew the world would be changing quickly, and while we could not foresee every conceivable outcome, we believe that if we would partner with the right customers for the long term, we would be much better able to face the market challenges together. Being able to take a long view drives innovative thinking and is often the catalyst that unlocks the value that is obscured by uncertainty.
In addition to having the right customers, we need to make the right investments. A great example of this is PharMEDium, which had another strong quarter. We have almost reached the 1 year anniversary of the acquisition, and we could not be more pleased. Integration of PharMEDium has been seamless, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. Our health systems customers understand the value of the products and services that PharMEDium provides, but it is the quality of their compounded sterile IV preparations that enabled them to earn new business. PharMEDium has been an excellent addition to AmerisourceBergen, hitting on all the important criteria we target for successful acquisitions culturally, strategically and financially, and we are very excited about the future potential of this business.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group once again had a strong quarter, with excellent performance across the board. We are the global leader in the distribution of specialty drugs and have long championed patient access to specialty products. The economics of specialty products can vary depending on a few key factors: the channel in which the product is administered or dispensed, whether the product is covered by the medical or pharmacy benefit; and the extent to which we could add value for the manufacturers and the provider. The unique portfolio of services we offer makes us a trusted partner in nearly every aspect of bringing specialty products to market. From supporting clinical trial logistics to consulting on commercialization strategies, we are participating in the early life cycle activities and the development of the markets for both innovative new therapies and for biosimilars. Our Specialty Group is comprised of market leaders, whether it is an oncology franchise, our plasma vaccine and physician office distribution businesses or our third party logistics business. Together, the group is the undisputed leader in enabling specialty products' success and is an essential partner for manufacturers, for providers and ultimately for the patients they serve.
This portfolio of offerings we have built will only become more important as the focus on value and cost efficiency increases. Just as we are advocates for our community pharmacy customers, we remain committed to our community oncologists and other specialty physicians. Our network of oncology practices are very well-positioned for quality initiatives like oncology medical home, which improved overall value. Additionally, we continue to invest in our market-leading franchise of dispensing practices that are leveraging clinical integration and real-time care coordination within and beyond the practice to improve patient adherence and reduce side effects and waste.
As I said last quarter, the cost to administer the products and to care for these patients are significant, and the risks associated with disruptions in care can be life-threatening. We are hopeful that CMS and others will be extremely thoughtful in considering proposals to change reimbursement rates and mechanisms of Part B drugs and will do so in a way that is always patient-minded.
While being focused on some key technology deployments, our customer -- our patient services and consulting businesses also had a solid September quarter. The expertise we have in developing patient access and adherence programs and the experience we bring to bear in the regulatory compliance and policy areas are clear differentiators for ABC. Over the last couple of years, we have worked to expand the global reach of these businesses to further enhance our value proposition to manufacturers. As we mentioned previously, our Consulting group is undergoing an ERP implementation, which is progressing well. The new platform will enable new possibilities for growth by driving innovation and expanding our capability to provide custom-tailored programs and services to our manufacturer customers.
Of course, the most significant global footprint we have today is in our World Courier business, which continues to grow. World Courier has been a very consistent performer for ABC, and its team continues to strengthen its position as the undisputed leader in niche premium logistics, particularly in support of clinical trials. World Courier's ERP and logistics platform implementation is also going well and will help ensure they remain the market leader for many years to come.
Turning now to MWI. They had solid results in the quarter and a very good year. Their performance is being driven by the companion side of the business, where organic growth, new innovative product introductions and market share gains all contributed. In addition, penetration rates with existing customers are improving. MWI has been a superb addition to ABC. They've performed exceptionally well from an operational and financial perspective, and its management has made significant and ongoing contributions to the whole of ABC. Among the many reasons we are so enthused about the business is the operational synergies ABC has brought to MWI such as their recently implemented WMS system and some of our technologies which enhanced patient intimacy in community setting. Likewise, MWI has brought ABC opportunities for more comprehensive discussions with suppliers in an area where we are truly competitively differentiated. We expect to continue to invest in animal health business as it is an area which have only just begun to realize the full slate of opportunities that lie ahead for this business.
Tim will provide the details, but I wanted to comment on the -- our key expectations heading into next year. In fiscal 2017, we expect to grow revenues in the range of 6.5% to 8% and to grow adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range that is flat to up 5% over the prior year. Our growth expectations have come down somewhat due to the increased uncertainty around brand drug inflation and the rate of generic deflation. We do expect, however, to return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of our fiscal year as we anniversary the customer contract renewal headwinds and we begin to lap some of the impact of decreases in drug pricing.
It is also worth noting that assuming that Walgreens and Rite Aid receive FTC clearance, we anticipate that we will begin to service Rite Aid towards the end of the fiscal year, and we have been making investments to ensure we are well-positioned to continue to drive the quality, scale and efficiency that this incremental volume will require of us.
In summary, I have great confidence in AmerisourceBergen's future. Despite unexpected headwinds in the year, the fact is we now just reported a 40% EPS increase year following on the heels of back-to-back 20%-plus growth years. While I'm personally disappointed that our projected growth rate for fiscal 2017 is not as strong as our past 3 years performance, I believe strongly that the strength of our long-term customer relationships and a unique portfolio of integrated services is and always will remain a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical manufacturers and provider customers. Our management team shares my passion and drive for producing strong and sustainable growth results while also delivering outstanding customer service. In the years ahead, we will continue to serve our industry with the same high level of discipline that we have demonstrated throughout the 15-year history of ABC in our legacy-formative companies. We provide a vital service in the global healthcare system, and we do so with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients while delivering balanced, long-term value to all of our stakeholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Tim."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would ask that you refer to our earnings release for a complete discussion of our GAAP results and reconciliation to our adjusted results. Consistent with past quarters, my remarks will focus only on our non-GAAP adjusted financial results.
As Steve mentioned, it was a challenging year in our industry and for ABC with the changing pharmaceutical pricing dynamics that we continue to work through. Overall, we did not finish exactly where we thought we would at the beginning of the year, but we successfully navigated a tough environment.
There's a lot to like about our fiscal '16. Let me spend a minute and cover a few key highlights. Most noteworthy would be the drug company's successful acquisition and integration of PharMEDium. We are very pleased with the results of the -- the business has delivered, and we are also pleased with the new talent and skill sets the PharMEDium employees bring to ABC. The second item, our ABSG specialty business had a very impressive year, with revenues passing $28 billion, and they achieved record operating income. And finally, we exit the fiscal year with improved balance sheet, and importantly, we successfully mitigated all of the potential dilution from the shares issued to Walgreens as a result of the warrant exercises. It's great to have the warrants officially behind us. This will simplify our reporting going forward.
This morning, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will recap fourth quarter consolidated and segment performance. Next, I'll spend a few minutes on our full year performance. And I will wrap up covering our fiscal '17 expectations. Let's begin our Q4 review. Our revenues increased roughly $2 billion to $37.6 billion, up 6%. Operating income,. Our adjusted operating income was $464 million, up $7 million or 2%. We certainly benefited from our operating expenses being down by 3%.
We've made a concerted effort through various cost initiatives to reduce expenses throughout ABC. This offset our gross profit being down in both dollars and percentage.
Moving below the operating income line. Income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 31.4% for the current quarter, down from the prior year. I should highlight that our quarterly tax expense included a slight year-to-date adjustment to bring our full year tax rate to 32.5%. This rate is just below the tax rate we had previously guided to as a result of slightly higher international income and favorable discrete tax adjustments we made closing out our fiscal year.
For the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 12% to $1.30. Let me highlight, we finished fiscal year '16 with 220 million outstanding common shares. Please remember that the 220 million outstanding shares is before the dilutive impact from share-based compensation. When combined, this number is used to calculate our diluted earnings per share going forward.
Next, let me cover our segment results, starting with Pharmaceutical Distribution. Total segment revenues were $36 billion, up 6%. Our Drug Company had solid revenue growth, up 5%. I should highlight that we continue to lap very strong hepatitis C revenues from the prior year, and this created a headwind in the current quarter of roughly 1.5%.
ABSG, which is our specialty business, had revenue growth of just over 15%. The business has now anniversary-ed the addition of a 3PL customer that has been enhancing revenue growth over the last year. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see especially strong revenue growth from the sale of oncology drugs, growing in the high teens as a percentage. Lastly, I should highlight that this quarter was another record revenue quarter for our ABSG business.
Moving to gross profit. The segment's gross profit was $785 million, down just about 1%. We saw solid gross profit dollar growth in our specialty business due to higher revenues. Our drug company's gross profit was down versus last year even with the addition of PharMEDium. We had the impact from 2 contract renewals with anchor customers: Kaiser, which took effect on July 1; and also CPA, our largest independent buying group customer.
There is strategic importance in signing these large, fast-growing customers to longer-term contracts. However, in the 12 months following the re-signing, the change in economics to bring the contract to the appropriate market price can be a meaningful headwind. Also, during the current quarter, we had a lower contribution from drug price inflation. These were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit dollars in our drug company business.
Segment operating expenses were $391 million and were down versus the prior year by 3% or about $14 million. Both the drug company and ABSG continue to closely manage their cost structures to ensure they are spending in the right areas. On a comparable basis to last year, so excluding the impact from PharMEDium, the segment's OpEx would have been down nearly 7%.
Adjusted segment operating income was $394 million, which is up 1%. Solid performance by our specialty group was offset by the expected lower contribution from the drug company.
We can now move to the -- to our Other segment, which includes MWI, our Patient Services consulting business; and World Courier. In the quarter, total segment revenues were $1.6 billion, up about 5%. Both our consulting and World Courier businesses had solid revenue growth in the quarter. Our MWI business was a little lower in terms of revenue growth this quarter due to a combination of 2 things: an impact from foreign currency from the U.K. business; and an impact also from some expected seasonality in the U.S. business. Let me point out, we continue to be very pleased with the U.S. companion animal side of the business, which had growth of nearly 6%. From an operating income standpoint, this segment had operating income of $70 million, up 4%.
The growth is after year-end compensation and incentive true-ups in all 3 businesses. Additionally, our consulting business is deep into their new ERP system implementation. Certain expenses that can't be capitalized negatively impacted the segment. These 2 items essentially reduced the growth rate by slightly more than half this quarter.
This completes our review of the September quarter. I'd like to now cover just a few fiscal year 2016 financial metrics.
Revenue. Our full year growth was a very good 8%. Our largest customer, Walgreens, represented just under 30% of our total ABC revenues. ABSG, our specialty business, finished the year at $28.5 billion, with revenue growth of 17%. Just an outstanding year for this business.
Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to just over $2 billion.
EPS. Our full-year adjusted diluted EPS was $5.62, up 14% due primarily to our operating income growth, mostly from our ABSG business and also having MWI for a full fiscal year.
Our drug company had a challenging year, with the negative impacts from contract renewals and industry drug pricing headwinds, but the benefit from PharMEDium helped to offset these items.
Free Cash flow. We had a terrific finish to our fiscal year. We ended at $2.7 billion of free cash flow. Our fourth quarter was much better than previously anticipated due to higher revenues and certain onetime working capital benefits at ABSG as well as a greater-than-expected positive impact from ending our year on a Friday, which is our best cash receipts day.
Now let's turn to fiscal '17 expectations. Before I start working through specific guidance items, I will make some overarching comments. Importantly, we have not included any impact to our P&L and cash flow from our largest customer, Walgreens, successfully completing their acquisition of Rite Aid. In light of the current pharmaceutical market dynamics, I want to comment on 3 key working assumptions. First, let's start with brand drug pricing. During fiscal '16, our brand inflation rate finished right at 10%. We did see some further moderation from the 10% during September, and it has continued through October. So as we think about fiscal '17, we have reduced our assumption for brand inflation to a range of 7% to 9%.
Lowering this range translates to a gross profit headwind to our fiscal '17 growth targets.
The next period where we traditionally see a high level of announcement activity will be during the month of January. Consequently, we have a period of time before we know how we are tracking against this assumption.
Next, generic drug pricing. We continue to expect a contribution from a modest level of price increases. But overall, our generic drug basket is expected to deflate in the 7% to 9% range during fiscal '17. This rate is consistent with what we experienced the second half of fiscal '16, and importantly, recent trends in the market indicate that the generic deflation rate has not improved, unfortunately.
In fiscal '17, the generic deflation rate will be a gross profit headwind for the entire fiscal year as opposed to just a partial year in fiscal '16. And finally, we expect the contribution from generic drug launches to be relatively flat year-to-year.
We can now transition to our specific guidance metrics for fiscal '17. Revenues. We expect consolidated ABC revenue growth in the range of 6.5% to 8%. While the decrease in the rate of brand drug inflation will weigh on our drug company's revenue growth, we expect our ABSG specialty business to grow slightly above 10%.
In the Other segment, we expect revenues to grow between 7% and 8%.
Consolidated gross profit. We don't provide specific guidance on gross profit, but to repeat previous commentary, our drug company business will have a significant gross profit headwind from 2 key customer contract renewals: CPA through the first 2 quarters of fiscal '17; and Kaiser, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '17.
Consolidated operating expenses. We expect a growth rate in this area of roughly 6% to 7% in fiscal '17. On past calls, we've noted that we are incurring incremental operating expenses related to strategic systems and technology we are implementing across the organization. Since these systems are all fairly significant in size and scope, most will be implemented while running parallel with existing systems. Let me also point out that our drug company is under way with a large capital project that will both upgrade and also expand capacity in their distribution center network, due in part to our expectation that eventually, we will serve the Rite Aid stores on behalf of Walgreens.
We are currently building 7 new distribution centers; 2 of these are incremental to the network while the remaining 5 are relocations to larger, more modern facilities. As a reference point, the 5 relocations, so the DCs that are being replaced, average 32 years in service life. Mostly this -- most of the associated dollars spent will be capitalized -- excuse me. However, this is also the same situation where we expect to incur duplicate expenses as we operate both the new and old distribution centers for a period of time.
These IT systems and infrastructure investments support our growth, improve the customer experience and, ultimately, increase our operating efficiency. However, there is a negative impact to our fiscal '17 operating expense growth rate of a couple of percentage points.
Consolidated adjusted operating income. We expect ABC operating income dollars to be in the range of down slightly to up 4%. This is driven by our drug company having EBIT that is flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We do expect good organic growth in our ABSG business but not enough to offset the lower growth in the drug company, with the gross profit headwinds I called out previously. We expect the Other segment to grow EBIT in the high single-digit percentage range.
Switching to operating margin. We expect consolidated margin to be down 5 to 10 basis points due primarily to mix of business, so large customers growing faster; and the impacts from our large contract renewals.
Tax rate. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 33%.
Share repurchases. Our guidance assumes modest share buybacks, enough to offset the dilutive impact from equity incentives. We are pleased that we are able to announce this morning in our earnings release our new $1 billion share authorization. We now have capacity of about $1.1 billion. As always, we will look to be thoughtful with our capital deployment, depending on our cash flow, competing uses of cash and market conditions.
Adjusted EPS. Over the last few months, unpredictability around pharmaceutical pricing has increased. Therefore, we are lowering our expected fiscal '17 EPS growth rates and also widening the range until such time that we have more clarity on these pharmaceutical pricing dynamics, both brand inflation and the rate of generic drug deflation. Consequently, we expect our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.63 to $5.88. The growth rate range is now flat to up 5% over our fiscal year '16 adjusted EPS of $5.62. Also, please note that we have not included any financial impact from the implementation of Medicare Part B demonstration project in our adjusted EPS guidance. It's quite possible the Part B demo project will be delayed, altered or even litigated.
Let me cover our adjusted EPS quarterly progression given the 2 large headwinds I called out previously, the 2 key contract renewals and moderating brand drug price inflation. We expect that our Q1 '17 adjusted EPS would be several cents below our actual results from Q1 '16. We also expect Q2 to be relatively flat to last year's results. We expect to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year as we cycle through these headwinds and have easier comparables.
Switching to cash flow. First, CapEx is expected to be slightly higher in fiscal '17 when compared to fiscal '16. It's likely we will reach $500 million due to the heavy capital investment under way, funding both the new IT systems and distribution centers.
Debt repayments. We do have a $600 million note that will mature in May 2017. The proceeds from this note were used to partially fund the repurchases of shares under our special share program. Now that the warrants are completed, it's our intent to repay this note at maturity.
Free cash flow. We now expect our free cash flow with fiscal '17 to be at or slightly above our adjusted net income. The expected year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily due to the following discrete items: one, the cash timing benefit we received from ending the year on a Friday. This benefit won't repeat. We estimate this impact to be roughly $500 million. Two, the continued investment in working capital with Walgreens; and three, certain onetime working capital improvements at our ABSG business that won't repeat in fiscal '17.
As I wrap up, I know that both Steve and my comments were especially long this morning due to covering several important topics, including guidance. So thank you for your attention.
I'd like to personally thank the ABC team for all the efforts made this year, delivering solid results in a challenging time for the industry. We are excited about starting the new fiscal year, but the challenging times are still with us. With our outstanding customer portfolio, our ability to execute in our financial resources, we are confident we will be able to continually adapt to working in a dynamic environment, and most importantly, delivering compelling, long-term shareholder value.
We appreciate your interest in ABC. Now here's Barbara to start our Q&A."

The environment is probably more challenging, and I think that's a function of customer consolidation. You've got a lot going on, on the M&A side, with key provider customers coming together, key manufacturers coming together. Everyone's facing cost and efficiency challenges, and I would say our customers are more consolidated, more informed and have always been very sophisticated and quite adept at demanding value from us. And I think our industry is being responsive. And maybe we just haven't had as many tailwinds as we usually have, but I think the environment is essentially the same as it's been from a competitive perspective for many, many years. And we pointed in my script towards working within our customer base, so I think that's a key point for us and getting more compliance from those relationships. Tim, you want to add anything?"

I came into the drug company in 2009, and that's really been more and more pronounced. And in Specialty, we often -- the wholesalers usually owned or we're very involved in -- at least in oncology, with our buying groups, and the same is true of, say, basic medical. So this is a function of the market, and for the most part, we have very productive relationships with those buying groups, but they are consolidating. I think we have close relationships with our key buying groups . That's gotten really dug in. CPA is a very good example. So as far as your specific question on pricing, generics has probably reached its peak. We saw some contracts where we were getting high teens in our generic compliance. And that's probably just not going to last because the industry's changed. So we've been, as we said, very thoughtful about specialty pricing and how that's going to change over, say, a 9-year contract that we have with CPA. You have to be cognizant of that. You have to be thoughtful of that because ABC's always thinking about the long-term and what does that 9-year contract look like, and just because in the last 9 years, contracts have been variably improved, that doesn't mean that the economics are going to change in the same way. Then that's why we said we're going to make money in different ways. We think biosimilars are going to be very important, new therapies. And that's a lot of how we're thinking about things. I'll quickly make a comment on your analytics and then it's an important question, so I'll let Tim also comment. But as the group's consolidated, I think they get more sophisticated. There's a lot of generic products out there. We manage thousands and thousands of contracts, but it's an independent practice. We would say that 2000 are very important, very critical, and they're very aware of the pricing. I think we also have a responsibility here to have balanced pricing to our independent customers. They have a tough time with managed care contracts and making sure that every prescription that they dispense is profitable. And we are sensitive to those discussions or in terms of being responsive to make sure that they are relevant and competitive in the marketplace as well.

As far as what the amount of brand contracts that are covered by fee-for-service, essentially all of our contracts are covered by fee-for-service.

I think it's always interesting, lose a relationships with the -- and I think it's a shared relationship between a buying group and a wholesaler. So that's why having that -- long-term contracts is extremely important so that we can work together on what the collaborative approach that I referred to in my script. So I think actually that last year is a pretty good example of that, and it probably wasn't good for the buying group, wasn't good for ABC and -- but not -- just one of those things that happened. I wouldn't say that, that pointed to some acute level of competition or anything or any of this drama that we've heard about a price war. So the incremental share that we've had in independence is very -- I think, we just are making sure that we're holding ground with those new contracts we signed. And we did work to try to keep some of those former customers, buying group customers, that had switched to a new wholesaler. We did work to keep them with ABC, but kept that in line with overall market because again, if people talk to each other in an efficient market, so we're going to make sure that anything we do is responsible and balanced. And then the telemarketers, I would say, are struggling a bit because I think our sales and our peer companies are looking at their compliance factor and have better tools to manage that, and it's not the growth that you have from so many new product launches. I've talked about our First to Shelf program. So if we had any gap where we weren't getting any product out upon a patent expiration fast enough, we're covering that. So we're saying to our customers, ""No need for you to order from a telemarketer; we're going to get that product to you first,"" and that's one of the examples, Eric, of an enhancement we make in our business.

There's a lot of different elements when we look at the fee-for-service contracts, but when the unit prices are so high, it is a discussion about what the market base fee-for-service is. We happen to think that there actually should be some headroom there because of the value of the services that we provide, which in difficult times, gets even more, we think, valuable and even more important to those manufacturers. So we worked hard.

And we just -- we said, okay. I mean, Tim and I sort of challenged Bob Mauch and our team. We said, listen, we're investing in Elevate, we're investing in business coaching, we're investing in First to Shelf, we've put our highest call rates in ProGen. We don't believe that people -- that our customers should look elsewhere within AmerisourceBergen, and that's really what that's been about. So CPA, by the way, is very compliant. We have 2 quarters that we've lapped now on the new contracts, so we have another 2 quarters where we'll be anniversary-ing that contract. We don't have a lot of big buying group renewals. A lot -- most of our buying group customers are under long-term contract that we believe are at market rates. So we don't have a lot of renewals coming up, and, Tim, I see you want to make a comment here, so..."

It's about a year, and we've had it -- some leadership changes there. I think we're very comfortable with the team. The focus at PharMEDium has really been on making sure that we maintain the high regulatory standards that the FDA and others expect of us. And we're working very hard. I think you'll see ABC and PharMEDium management team having the right orientation there. That's going to be very, very important to continue to lift the standards. So that's been a lot of the focus, and we've been through a lot of the integration there. And they've had some benefits from some new product launches, and their pricing there is definitely a different environment and then the rest of the generic environment that we see. Their market share is very, very good. They work with 2000 systems, and their biggest opportunity is to really -- to just do more a bigger share of wallet with their customers, but their pricing is so differentiated than our other -- our overall health system GPO customers that we haven't really looked at integrated offerings, and probably shouldn't really because it's like you're sort mixing apples and oranges. But we are always mindful of -- absent the whole the Wells Fargo mess, we're not -- we're always mindful of cross-selling and looking for those synergies with customers. So appreciate the question on PharMEDium, please. Thanks."
