We are delighted to report that sales growth during the fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we believe we gained market share on an overall basis during the quarter, both here in North America and of course, internationally, as we successfully continued our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. 
We are especially pleased with our worldwide internal growth in local currencies for the quarter of 6.5%, which we're very pleased represents the highest quarterly growth rate in 8 years. 
Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.67. This caps off a successful 2015 performance with worldwide local internal sales growth of 5%, and adjusted EPS growth for the year -- for the full year of nearly 10%, and that is, of course, despite the continued negative impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
And looking into this year into 2016, today, we are pleased to reaffirm our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to 2015 adjusted EPS. There is no question that our almost 19,000 Team Schein Members around the world are working together as a team to execute on our 2015, '16 and '17 strategic plan. The morale of the company is great, and that's the reason why we have these solid results. So thank you to the team. Thanks to our board. Thanks to our customers and our suppliers. 
In a moment I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent performance and business accomplishments, but first, Steven will review our financial results for the quarter and for the year."
339447,323541573,930254,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or",2048,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which will be excluding those restructuring costs as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes. Also, Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
So turning to our Q4 results. The net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2015, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 5.5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. This consisted of 10.3% growth in local currencies and a 4.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against this translation exposure. In local currencies or constant currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.5%, which, as Stan just mentioned, was the highest in 8 years, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.8%. 
I'd also like to comment that based on our experience and what we're seeing in the end markets thus far in 2016, the overall Dental, Medical and Animal Health markets that we serve continue to reflect stable to an improving environment. You could also know the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit E of today's news release. 
The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 7.0%. That's a contraction of 47 basis points compared to last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5%, which is essentially unchanged versus the prior year. I'd also like to point out that on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin, excluding our restructuring costs for the full year, expanded by 34 basis points, which is ahead of our stated goal. 
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1%, and on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, was 29.8%. This compares with 29.7% in last year's fourth quarter, and for 2016, we believe the effective tax rates will continue to be in the same 30% range. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $139.3 million or $1.67 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. It's important to reiterate that foreign currency exchange continue to have a negative impact on our EPS, was approximately $0.07 for the quarter and $0.26 for the full year. 
If we look at our results for the full year, there are a number of important highlights to report. We had 8.4% sales growth in local currencies, highlighted by 5.0% internal growth in constant currency. As I just said, we had operating margin expansion on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, of 34 basis points, and that represents our best annual operating margin expansion also since 2008. 
We had diluted EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis of nearly 10%, and we're very pleased to have delivered on our original guidance despite the negative headwind of $0.26 per share related to foreign currency. Our operating cash flow was also strong at $586.8 million and exceeded our non-GAAP net income by $85 million. 
So, I guess, it's fair to sum it up and say we believe 2015 was truly excellent year. Exhibit B of this morning's news release again reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and diluted EPS from continuing operations. 
If we look at our sales results for the fourth quarter, the Dental, the Global Dental sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 1.5% to $1.4 billion. This 1.5% growth consisted of 7.3% growth in local currencies, offset by a 5.8% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 6.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.7%. Of this 6.6% internal growth in local currencies, we had North American growth of 7.6% and international growth of 4.9%. 
I'll quickly give you some additional details between -- on each of those 2 numbers. First, the North American internal growth of 7.6% included 6.1% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 11.5% growth in the Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers in the quarter while growth in equipment sales and service revenues related to particular strength in traditional equipment for us. 
If we look at our international growth of 4.9% internal growth in constant currencies, that included 4.0% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 7.0% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. The consumable merchandise sales growth was led by strong performance in a number of countries, including France and the U.K., and the equipment sales and service revenue growth was led by a number of countries also including Germany, Australia, Austria and the U.K. 
Turning to our Animal Health business. Sales were $756.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.4%. This included growth of 9.5% in local currencies, offset by a 6.1% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 2.3% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.2% of growth. Of that 2.3% internal growth, the components were 1.2% growth in North America and 3.3% growth, international -- on our international business. It's important to note that the 1.2% growth in North America was actually 8.4% growth when we normalize for results to account for the impact of certain product switching between agency and direct sales as well as excluding sales of diagnostic products in both the current and prior year periods due to the changes in the veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. We believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. 
I'd also like to mention that Q4 2015 -- that this Q4 2015 results will be the last quarter that we'll be adjusting for sales of diagnostic products as they've now annualized. However, we will continue to normalize our sales results to account for any switches between agency sales and direct sales on an ongoing basis if that's significant. 
If we look at our Medical sales, they were $561.6 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of 21.6% and consisted of 22.2% growth in local currencies, offset by a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 13.4%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 8.8% to our growth. 
If we look at North American sales growth, it was really very strong at 23.2%, including internal sales growth of 14.0%. Here also when you normalize for the impact of agency sales, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 10.2%, resulting in the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth for our North American Medical business, and we're continuing to see nice success in both large group practices and IDNs. 
If we look at our influenza vaccine sales, they were $20 million for the fourth quarter. That's down approximately 23% versus the prior year's quarter, but that's primarily due to timing. On a full year basis, our influenza vaccine sales were relatively consistent versus the prior year. 
For the past year, we believe we've been outperforming the Medical market by a significant margin as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices. I'll also note that the international Medical sales, which is a small part of our Medical Group, saw a slight decline of 0.3% in constant currencies for the quarter. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added sales -- Value-Add Services sales, they were $93.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.8%. This included 4.5% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline -- 1.7% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we saw internally generated sales increased 4%, and acquisition growth was an additional 0.5%. The components of that 4% internal growth in constant currencies was 4.2% in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Through some product upgrade enhancements, strategic acquisitions and the advanced technology products and services we offer, they provide really for efficient delivery of health care services, and we believe there are new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups. 
Looking at some other factors, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we bought about 1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $146.90, which was approximately $149 million and this impact of the repurchase for the fourth quarter was less than $0.01 on our EPS. 
For the full year 2015, we repurchased $300 million of our stock, representing 2.1 million shares at an average price of $143.86 per share, and that's in line at the high end of our stated goals. At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and as we noted when we that authorization was received for the past 4 years, we've been repurchasing about $300 million a year. And in recognition of the company being a larger company, larger market cap, stronger cash flow, our Board of Directors recently improved this increase to $400 million. 
We continue to believe our capital allocation strategy that employs a large portion of annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and acquisitions, continues to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we take a look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, operating cash flow for the quarter was just under $300 million compared with $274 million last year. And for the year, the operating cash flow was again $586 million, and free cash flow over $0.5 billion at $515 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow. Our working capital accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 39.3 days. That compares to 39 days for the quarter -- of last year's quarter. Inventory turns were 5.6 turns for the quarter. That compares to 5.9 turns in last year's fourth quarter. 
And finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. So for 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents a growth of 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of 2015 of $5.96. 
As is always for us, our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which we expect to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per diluted share in the first half of 2016. 
Finally, I'd like to note something that I think is important. If we look at our quarterly progression, the adjusted diluted EPS growth for Q1 2016 is expected to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits versus the prior year. Historically, sales are lowest in the first quarter of each year, operating expenses as a percentage of sales are generally highest since certain fixed expenses and nonvariable compensation expenses are recorded relatively evenly throughout the year. 
Over the course of the year, we expect to realize efficiencies through the restructuring as well as get leverage on our infrastructure as well as get synergies on recent acquisitions. So for that reason again, we expect Q1 to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits growth of EPS. Again, this growth assumes for the full year that exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. We haven't seen really very wide volatility in that at this point, but we're continuing to watch exchange rates. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with the Dental Group. I'm pleased to report that fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in the North America, intern",2243,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with the Dental Group. 
I'm pleased to report that fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in the North America, internationally and for the group as a whole were all at multiyear highs. In North America, consumable merchandise internal growth in local currencies of 6.1% was particularly strong, highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in the local -- in local currencies of 11.5% also was, in our view, excellent and reflected strength in sales of traditional equipment. International consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew by 4%. International equipment sales and service internal sales growth in local currencies was a solid 7%. 
So let me point out that our Global Dental sales growth in local currencies for the full year was 5% as we continue to gain market share globally. This growth was well balanced between our North American and international businesses. 
A notable acquisition in our Dental Group during 2015 was our 90% ownership in Dental Trey of Italy, which I discussed during last quarter's call. Dental Trey had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately USD 49 million and complements our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relationships. Of course, they are particularly strong in the KOL and education areas, key opinion leader area and education of dentists. 
I'm very excited that we recently signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a distributor of dental supplies and equipment in Brazil. This investment will build upon our existing business in Brazil, which we established in 2014. 
Brazil's Dental market is fueled by an aging population and a growing middle class that recognizes the importance of oral care. With 2015 sales of approximately USD 70 million, Dental Cremer serves approximately 60,000 Dental practitioners across Brazil, an important opportunity for us to sell additional products to an excellent customer base. We look forward to welcoming the Dental Cremer team to Team Schein once the transaction closes, which we expect to be towards the latter half of 2016 -- or the first half or the latter half of the first half of 2016. 
Now on the Animal Health group side, normalized internal growth in local currencies was 5.6% for the quarter, including 8.4% growth in North America. Growth in our North American group also continues to benefit from strategic acquisitions and investment, and 2015 was an active year, in particular in Europe. 
We expanded our equipment capabilities through the purchase of scil animal care. scil sold services and support, laboratory and imaging diagnostic but an products to veterinarians in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy the Netherlands and Spain and has a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. We're particularly pleased with this acquisition as it will, no doubt, advance our global presence in the Animal Health diagnostic field, given the terrific know-how that the team has and the great product offering and the relationship with many suppliers in this field, who are really itching to get involved in the global diagnostic field seeking a channel, and scil provides that outstanding channel in conjunction with our distribution uplift in North America, Europe and actually shortly in Hong Kong, where we will launch our first Asia Animal Health presence and of course, our significant presence in Australia and New Zealand. So this whole opportunity of scil, which had sales of approximately $75 million for the full year of 2015 gives us really a strategic benefit in the Animal Health space to advance diagnostics and equipment. 
During the year, we acquired an 85% interest in Kruuse, a leading distributor of veterinary suppliers in the Nordic countries and globally through a worldwide distribution network. Kruuse had sales in 2014 of approximately USD 90 million. With this investment, we extended Henry Schein's presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but more importantly, the broad offering through the Kruuse portfolio of products, which is well received in the markets that are currently served, will present a huge base to expand our unique products in the countries where that Kruuse is really serving but also taking this product line globally. 
We plan to expand our distribution of these products across our global Animal Health platform. Many of our companies do not sell the Kruuse line yet, which is in line with our strategy to offer choices to our customers, so that they can select the products that best fit the specific needs of their practice. 
Also, in 2015, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, which is a leading Animal Health distributor in Romania. Maravet had sales of about USD 23 million. With the acquisition of scil, Kruuse and Maravet, Henry Schein's Animal Health business expanded to 23 countries. 
Now let me turn to our Medical Group. As Steven mentioned, double-digit North American sales growth was quite robust during the quarter, and I'd like to make some general comments about this business. You may recall that we announced strategic agreement with Cardinal in late November 2014. This strategic agreement was born out of the vision to offer a seamless solution that supports improved care, increased customer satisfaction and lower cost for acute and nonacute sides of care, and specifically with the 2, the acute and nonacute sides have common ownership. Both Henry Schein and Cardinal have extensive expense providing service to our communities across the United States. We are using our experience and expertise to provide resources that we believe will drive better outcomes across the continuum of care. By leveraging our respective strengths, we are providing powerful solutions, we believe, including a wide breadth of products, analytics and other tools for smaller customers to the very largest customers in this country, including the rapidly growing IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We believe the value proposition provided by Henry Schein and Cardinal can maximize the success of our customers through our best-in-class service capabilities, help the system touch base and of course, the product offering. 
Looking at the terrific progress we have made to date, our sales teams have continued to make joint customer presentations, and the reception has been quite positive. The transition of Cardinal's physician-related ultimate care customers to Henry Schein platform is substantially complete, and we remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers by being uniquely positioned to jointly solve a broad continuum of health care along with Cardinal Health. 
During the fourth quarter, we further expanded the breadth of value-added products we made available to our Medical customers with 2 agreements, in particular, that I would like to highlight today. We were named by Medtronic as exclusive distributor for certain diabetes products to primary care physicians in the U.S. Also, we entered into a nonexclusive agreement with Cepheid to distribute their GeneXpert system, which to date has been largely targeted and available to U.S. hospital labs. 
I think you can expect Henry Schein to add significant numbers of Value-Added Services and expand our offering in the Medical arena in the years to come. 
Now let me conclude my business review with Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.2% in local currencies, and this reflects particularly -- particular strength in electronic services and Value-Added Services. 
International growth in local currencies was about 2.7%. We recently acquired RxWorks, a Practice Management Software company serving veterinarians in Australia and New Zealand, U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately $7 million. 
RxWorks brings Henry Schein an installed base of more than 1,500 veterinary clinics, strengthens our growing Practice Management Software business and of course, complements our expanding Animal Health technology business, and when I say that, it's all about interoperability and connectivity, the connection of our Practice Management Software we believe by far, the largest installed base with diagnostic equipment, which and other digitalized equipment as in Dental, where we made good progress in this area, we have made good progress in Animal Health, and we expect this to be a key driver of our business together with the data side. 
Let me talk about the data side for a minute. Early this year, we completed our acquisition of an 81% -- 80.1% interest in Vetstreet, a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. Vetstreet had sales in 2014 of about $43 million. We are particularly excited about the potential to prepare our Practice Management Software solutions with a data analytics capability of Vetstreet, which can offer valuable market insights to helping manufacturers and veterinarians improve the success of treatment of various kinds and business efficiency. 
We are particularly pleased with the expansion of our installed base, our Practice Management Software in the vet space and our big data capabilities that we now will integrate into our platform as a result of the acquisition of Vetstreet. We believe we have the right team and the right vision to create real value for our suppliers and for our customers in the veterinary arena. 
Also, this past summer, Henry Schein, Cerner, Lidos and Accenture won a bid for the Department of Finance health care management system modernization project. Henry Schein will provide Dental software and services with our Dentrix enterprise products. It is a privilege to be a part of this partnership aimed at improving the health care of our military, and our Dentrix enterprise software will allow for seamless sharing of Medical and Dental information in this community. 
We are pleased to join with these industry leaders for the ultimate benefit of the Armed Forces of the United States and believe that we will also be in a better position with the advancement of this contract to provide a wider variety of services to the larger practices in the developed world and potentially even the developing world, very, very exciting progress for Henry Schein practice solutions business. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few of the highlights of last year. We are extremely pleased to have met or even exceeded many of significant goals while advancing our strategic plan, of course, the strategic plan for 2015, '16 and '17. 
We did receive a number of awards and recognitions last year, very important for our team, who really work very, very hard daily to meet the expectations or exceed the expectations of our suppliers and our customers. We were named to Fortune magazine's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the 14th consecutive year, being named 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute for the fourth consecutive year and being named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine in their inaugural ranking. 
We also were recognized by our commitment to diversity, cultural competency and health care equity by various Hispanics and LGBT organizations. It's all about people, and it's the people at Henry Schein that have grown this company into the largest provider of products and related services to office-based Dental, Medical and veterinary practitioners. 
And it's really terrific that our team is being recognized. We continued our climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies and now stand at #287. And in March, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology both are ongoing commitment of Henry Schein. We combined these passions when creating the Henry Schein digital center of excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University of Philadelphia. You can expect expansion of this kind of program through Dental schools throughout the United States and of course, in Canada and elsewhere. 
Also, during 2015, we announced a partnership with the American College of Prosthetics, Prosthodontics Education Foundation along with other Dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. 
There is no question Henry Schein's #1 strategy is to advance our digitalized presence in the prosthetic arena, both in the lab, in the Dental office, stand-alone, scanners and full integrated systems all integrated into a chair side capability and enter our Practice Management systems, both in the smaller practices, the larger practices and the Dental schools of the world. 
And finally, after the annual meeting of the world economic forum in Davos in 2015, a number of public and private sector organizations, including Henry Schein, came together to develop a global supply chain framework, global supply chain framework to enhance pandemic preparedness and response. In the past year, these organizations have collaborated to develop a partnership called the Global Supply Network for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Once successfully launched, this supply network will serve a shared platform to save lives and form intervention planning and communicate critical information plus the lessons learned, so that the world's response to pandemic continuously improves. Henry Schein believes in public-private partnerships as a core value and a key part of our success. 
So with that overview of our quarterly and full year financials and operating performance with a huge thanks to Team Schein, our suppliers and our customers and of course, our investors, who we are committed to providing a reliable, continuous stream of income, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. 
And now, operator, we're ready to take questions."

So yes, our traditional business has -- did very well, but let me hasten to point out that in January 2015, we did announce taking on the A-dec line",720,"Well, there's a lot of questions you're asking probably the key question for our equipment business today. So yes, our traditional business has -- did very well, but let me hasten to point out that in January 2015, we did announce taking on the A-dec line, which we actually brought in around May. We did, I think, do well on the A-dec line. I believe we did live up to the expectations and perhaps even exceeded what was expected from us by A-dec, but let me hasten to say that we did well with our traditional suppliers that have supported us for decades, and in that context, overall we did well with the traditional equipment. Obviously, adding the A-dec line put stress on our organization from equipment organization and our field sales consultants from a learning point of view and from a service point of view, learning how to service the equipment and fine-tuning our design capabilities. All of that was well absorbed while maintaining the relationship with our branded manufacturers that have supported us for all these years. So I would say overall, the manufacturers are pleased and our sales organization is pleased, and now I am, of course, dealing with the United States and Canada. On the digital side and the high-tech side, I believe we made pretty good progress as well. We currently believe we're selling more than one of 3 new units in the CAD/CAM space, which is our #1 global strategy to advance digitalized prosthetics. We are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan offerings. Of course, I think you know Henry Schein is committed to open architecture to the extent suppliers provide us with the products. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression solutions and provides dentists with innovative, what we believe, innovative, robust and efficient choices for students of dentistry. In addition, we continue to be well positioned, we believe, and have made huge progress in the lab. So when you look at equipment it's not only the equipment that is sold to the dentist but to the lab as well, and it's in the digital restorations that we outsource -- that providing solutions for the digital restorations that are outsourced to lab facilities that we also feel we are doing very well. So it's the entire spectrum of traditional equipment, including digital imaging, 3D, et cetera, sensors and of course, the digital prosthetics that I think we have done very well, and we believe overall we have gained market share, balancing those suppliers that work with us over the years with A-dec, and I believe we satisfied our obligation and more than satisfied our obligation across the board. We are particularly pleased with the level of integration between our practice solutions businesses, both at Dentrix and at, which is the schools business. So overall, I think we are very pleased with the direction of our equipment business in the United States. You asked specifically about the large accounts. Yes, the top 50 accounts in the United States and our special markets group are very important to us, and we continue to do well in those -- in that space. Of course, there is competition. You know about it. Everybody's focused on this, but I believe we have very good solutions for these accounts. In addition, our midmarket group, which became quite active in the second half of the year, that's the group that is multiple locations -- that has multiple locations under common management and generally owned by a dentist versus the very large practice that are generally owned by financial sponsor or yes, no public companies financial sponsor. So we have covering both sides of the market as well as the -- so the very big, the midsized and of course, the Dental schools and other institutions. I believe that continues to do well Henry Schein. And then internationally, we did well. We were actually very pleased with the fourth quarter in that the halo effect of the IDS continued into the fourth quarter, and we believe actually has spilled over into the first quarter. So overall, our equipment business throughout the world is doing quite well. I could go on and on and on, but I think that's probably enough."

We're still seeing full unit sales in addition to that, but there's been a little bit of a change in the market over the last year or 2, where customers are beginning to look at scan only to start with, and then hopefully the future, they'll add the milling machine. So that's been a nice opportunity for us, and the only other point that I wanted just to add is A-dec has helped the traditional equipment growth obviously. But the good news is that Stanley said this I believe is that we haven't seen a cannibalize of the equipment life. So we really do things that we're penetrating new customers with the A-dec product line, for the most part, and that's also good news. That's not just swapping out other equipment lines."

The first is specialty products per se that are only used by specialists and used by those GPs that are doing specialty procedures.

When we talk about our Specialty business we are referring to not that product, the general products, which are part of our core business and nor are we referring to the software in particular that's part of our Software business, but we referring to the specialty products like implants, bone regeneration, wires and brackets and files, et cetera in the endo space, and in that space, it's hard for us to measure how the market is growing because no one compares what we compares.

So and be very pleased with that team really on these, and now you ask about large animal. Nothing's never, but we don't think distributing branded pharmaceuticals in mass on a logistics basis for large animals is really the best use of our capital. It's not too different to us years ago exiting the specialty pharma space, where there's huge amounts of sales available that are relatively large margin. Better for the drug wholesalers to do that than for us. So in the large animals space, we will continue to look for market opportunities. Some countries present the opportunity. For example, in the dairy industry, we're quite active in Ireland and parts of Europe and in particular, New Zealand. So there's an opportunity. The equine area, which is not really, I suppose it would be large animals, but it's not really production animals as an area where we're very interested in and believe we can bring value. And then our markets like Australia and New Zealand, pieces of Europe, where we believe that through our logistics, we add value that others don't add. So and will be unique products for the large animal. For example, Kruuse has, scil has, veterinary instruments, orthopedic business provides. So we will be more selective to find areas that we could bring value, and this creates high-margin opportunity rather than shipping of massive amounts of low-margin branded pharmaceuticals."

We are delighted to report that sales growth during the fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we believe we gained market share on an overall basis during the quarter, both here in North America and of course, internationally, as we successfully continued our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. 
We are especially pleased with our worldwide internal growth in local currencies for the quarter of 6.5%, which we're very pleased, represents the highest quarterly growth rate in 8 years. 
Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.67. This caps off a successful 2015 performance with worldwide local internal sales growth of 5%, and adjusted EPS growth for the year -- for the full year of nearly 10%, and that is of course, despite the continued negative impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
And looking into this year -- into 2016, today, we are pleased to reaffirm our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to 2015 adjusted EPS. Of course, there is just no questions that our almost 19,000 Team Schein Members around the world are working together as a team to execute on our 2015, '16 and '17 strategic plan.

In a moment I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent performance and business accomplishments, but first, Steven will review our financial results for the quarter and for the year."
339447,323541573,930427,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or",2054,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which would be excluding those restructuring cost as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes. Also, Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
So turning to our Q4 results. The net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2015, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 5.5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. This consisted of 10.3% growth in local currencies and a 4.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against this translation exposure. In local currencies or constant currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.5% which, as Stan just mentioned, was the highest in 8 years, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.8%. 
I'd also like to comment that based on our experience and what we're seeing in the end markets thus far in 2016, the overall Dental, Medical and Animal Health markets that we serve continue to reflect stable to an improving environment. You could also know the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit E of today's news release. 
The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 7.0%. That's a contraction of 47 basis points compared to last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5%, which is essentially unchanged versus the prior year. I'd also like to point out that on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin, excluding our restructuring costs for the full year, expanded by 34 basis points, which is ahead of our stated goal. 
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1%, and on a non-GAAP basis excluding the restructuring costs, was 29.8%. This compares with 29.7% in last year's fourth quarter, and for 2016, we believe the effective tax rates will continue to be in the same 30% range. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $139.3 million or $1.67 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 4.7% and 7.1% respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. It's important to reiterate that foreign currency exchange continued to have a negative impact on our EPS, was approximately $0.07 for the quarter and $0.26 for the full year. 
If we look at our results for the full year, there are a number of important highlights to report. We had 8.4% sales growth in local currencies, highlighted by 5.0% internal growth in constant currency. As I just said, we had operating margin expansion on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs of 34 basis points, and that represents our best annual operating margin expansion, also since 2008. 
We had diluted EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis of nearly 10%, and we're very pleased to have delivered on our original guidance despite the negative headwind of $0.26 per share related to foreign currency. Our operating cash flow was also strong at $586.8 million and exceeded our non-GAAP net income by $85 million. 
So, I guess, it's fair to sum it up and say we believe 2015 was truly an excellent year. Exhibit B of this morning's news release again reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and diluted EPS from continuing operations. 
If we look at our sales results for the fourth quarter, the Dental -- the Global Dental sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 1.5% to $1.4 billion. This 1.5% growth consisted of 7.3% growth in local currencies, offset by a 5.8% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 6.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.7%. Of this 6.6% internal growth in local currencies, we had North American growth of 7.6% and international growth of 4.9%. 
I'll quickly give you some additional detail between -- on each of those 2 numbers. First, the North American internal growth of 7.6% included 6.1% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 11.5% growth in the Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers in the quarter while growth in equipment sales and service revenues related to particular strength in traditional equipment for us. 
If we look at our international growth of 4.9% internal growth in constant currencies, that included 4.0% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 7.0% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. The consumable merchandise sales growth was led by strong performance in a number of countries, including France and the U.K., and the equipment sales and service revenue growth was led by a number of countries also including Germany, Australia, Austria and the U.K. 
Turning to our Animal Health business. Sales were $756.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.4%. This included growth of 9.5% in local currencies, offset by a 6.1% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 2.3% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.2% to growth. Of that 2.3% internal growth, the components were 1.2% growth in North America and 3.3% growth, international -- on our international business. It's important to note that the 1.2% growth in North America was actually 8.4% growth when we normalize for results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales as well as when excluding sales of diagnostic products in both the current and prior year periods due to the changes in the veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. We believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. 
I'd also like to mention that Q4 2015 -- that this Q4 2015 results will be the last quarter that we'll be adjusting for sales of diagnostic products since they've now annualized. However, we will continue to normalize our sales results to account for any switches between agency sales and direct sales on an ongoing basis if that's significant. 
If we look at our Medical sales, they were $561.6 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of 21.6% and consisted of 22.2% growth in local currencies, offset by a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 13.4%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 8.8% to our growth. 
If we look at North American sales growth, it was really very strong at 23.2%, including internal sales growth of 14.0%. Here also when you normalize for the impact of agency sales, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 10.2%, resulting in the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth for our North American Medical business, and we're continuing to see a nice success in both large group practices and IDNs. 
If we look at our influenza vaccine sales, they were $20 million for the fourth quarter. That's down approximately 23% versus the prior year's quarter, but that's primarily due to timing and on a full year basis, our influenza vaccine sales were relatively consistent versus the prior year. 
For the past year, we believe we've been outperforming the Medical market by a significant margin as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices. I'll also note that the international Medical sales, which is a small part of our Medical Group, saw a slight decline of 0.3% in constant currencies for the quarter. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added sales -- Value-Add Services sales, they were $93.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.8%. This included 4.5% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline -- 1.7% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we saw internally generated sales increased 4% and acquisition growth was an additional 0.5%. The components of that 4% internal growth in constant currencies was 4.2% in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Through some product upgrade enhancements, strategic acquisitions and the advanced technology products and services we offer, they provide really for efficient delivery of healthcare services, and we believe there are new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups. 
Looking at some other factors. We continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we bought about 1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $146.90, which was approximately $149 million and this impact of the repurchase for the fourth quarter was less than $0.01 on our EPS. 
For the full year 2015, we repurchased $300 million of our stock, representing 2.1 million shares at an average price of $143.86 per share, and that's in line at the high end of our stated goals. At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and as we noted, when we -- that authorization was received, for the past 4 years, we've been repurchasing about $300 million a year, and in recognition of the company being a larger company, larger market cap, stronger cash flow, our Board of Directors recently improved this increase to $400 million. 
We continue to believe our capital allocation strategy that deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and acquisitions, continues to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we take a look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, operating cash flow for the quarter was just under $300 million compared with $274 million last year. And for the year, the operating cash flow was again $586 million and free cash flow over $0.5 billion at $515 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow. Our working capital accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 39.3 days. That compares to 39 days for the quarter -- of the last year's quarter. Inventory turns were 5.6 turns for the quarter. That compares to 5.9 turns in last year's fourth quarter. 
And finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. So for 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents a growth of 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of 2015 of $5.96. 
As is always for us, our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which we expect to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per diluted share in the first half of 2016. 
Finally, I'd like to note something that I think is important. If we look at our quarterly progression, the adjusted diluted EPS growth for Q1 2016 is expected to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits versus the prior year. Historically, sales are lowest in the first quarter of each year, operating expenses as a percentage of sales are generally highest since certain fixed expenses and nonvariable compensation expenses are recorded relatively evenly throughout the year. 
Over the course of the year, we expect to realize efficiencies through the restructuring as well as get leverage on our infrastructure as well as get synergies on recent acquisitions. So for that reason again, we expect Q1 to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits growth of EPS. Again, this growth assumes for the full year that exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. We haven't seen really very wide volatility in that at this point, but we're continuing to watch exchange rates. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with the Dental Group. I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in the North America, in",2246,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with the Dental Group. 
I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in the North America, internationally and for the group as a whole were all at multi-year highs. In North America, consumable merchandise internal growth in local currencies of 6.1% was particularly strong, highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in the local -- in local currencies of 11.5% also was, in our view, excellent and reflected strength in the  sales of traditional equipment. International consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew by 4%. International equipment sales and service internal sales growth in local currencies was a solid 7%. 
So let me point out that our Global Dental sales growth in local currencies for the full year was 5% as we continue to gain market share globally. This growth was well balanced between our North American and international businesses. 
A notable acquisition in our Dental Group during 2015 was our 90% ownership in Dental Trey of Italy, which I discussed during last quarter's call. Dental Trey had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately USD 49 million and complements our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relationships. Of course, they are particularly strong in the KOL and education areas, the key opinion leader area and education of dentists. 
I'm very excited that we recently signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a distributor of dental supplies and equipment in Brazil. This investment will build upon our existing business in Brazil, which we established in 2014.  Brazil's Dental market is fueled by an aging population and a growing middle class that recognizes the importance of oral care. With 2015 sales of approximately USD 70 million, Dental Cremer serves approximately 60,000 Dental practitioners across Brazil, an important opportunity for us to sell additional products to an excellent customer base. We look forward to welcoming the Dental Cremer team to Team Schein once the transaction closes, which we expect to be towards the latter half of 2016 -- or the first half or the latter half of the first half of 2016. 
Now on the Animal Health group side, normalized internal growth in local currencies was 5.6% for the quarter, including 8.4% growth in North America. Growth in our North American group also continues to benefit from strategic acquisitions and investment, and 2015 was an active year, in particular in Europe. 
We expanded our equipment capabilities through the purchase of scil animal care. scil sells services and supports laboratory and imaging diagnostic products to veterinarians in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain and has a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. We're particularly pleased with this acquisition as it will, no doubt, advance our global presence in the Animal Health diagnostic field. Given the terrific know-how that the scil team has and their great product offering and the relationship with many suppliers in this field, who are really itching to get involved in the global diagnostic field seeking a channel, and scil provides that outstanding channel in conjunction with our distribution outlets in North America, Europe and actually -- shortly, in Hong Kong, where we will launch our first Asia Animal Health presence and of course, our significant presence in Australia and New Zealand. So this whole opportunity of scil, which had sales of approximately $75 million for the full year of 2015 gives us really a strategic benefit in the Animal Health space to advanced diagnostics and equipment. 
During the year, we acquired an 85% interest in KRUUSE, a leading distributor of veterinary suppliers in the Nordic countries and globally through a worldwide distribution network. KRUUSE had sales in 2014 of approximately USD 90 million. With this investment, we extended Henry Schein's presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but more importantly, the broad offering through the KRUUSE portfolio of products which is well received in the markets that are currently served, will present a huge base to expand our unique products in the countries where KRUUSE is already serving but also taking this product line globally. 
We plan to expand our distribution of products across our global Animal Health platform. Many of our companies do not sell the KRUUSE line yet, which is in line with our strategy to offer choices to our customers so that they can select the products that best fit the specific needs of their practice. 
Also, in 2015, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, which is a leading Animal Health distributor in Romania. Maravet had sales of about USD 23 million. With the acquisition of scil, KRUUSE and Maravet, Henry Schein's Animal Health business expanded to 23 countries. 
Now let me turn to our Medical Group. As Steven mentioned, double-digit North American sales growth was quite robust during the quarter, and I'd like to make some general comments about this business. You may recall that we announced a strategic agreement with Cardinal in late November of 2014. This strategic agreement was born out of a vision to offer a seamless solution that supports improved care, increased customer satisfaction and lower cost for acute and non-acute sides of care, and specifically with the 2, the acute and non-acute sides have common ownership. Both Henry Schein and Cardinal have extensive experience in providing service to our communities across the United States. We are using our experience and expertise to provide resources that we believe will drive better outcomes across the continuum of care. By leveraging our respective strengths, we are providing powerful solutions, we believe, including a wide breadth of products, analytics and other tools for smaller customers to the very largest customers in this country, including the rapidly growing IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We believe the value proposition provided by Henry Schein and Cardinal can maximize the success of our customers through our best-in-class service capabilities, help the system touch points [ph] and of course, the product offering. 
Looking at the terrific progress we have made to date, our sales teams have continued to make joint customer presentations, and the reception has been quite positive. The transition of Cardinal's physician-related ultimate care customers to Henry Schein platform is substantially complete, and we remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers by being uniquely positioned to jointly solve a broad continuum of health care along with Cardinal Health. 
During the fourth quarter, we further expanded the breadth of value-added products we've made available to our Medical customers with 2 agreements in particular, that I would like to highlight today. We were named by Medtronic as exclusive distributor for certain diabetes products to primary care physicians in the U.S. Also, we entered into a nonexclusive agreement with Cepheid to distribute their GeneXpert system, which to date has been largely targeted and available to U.S. hospital labs. 
I think you can expect Henry Schein to add significant numbers of Value-Added Services and expand our offering in the Medical arena in the years to come. 
Now let me conclude my business review with Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.2% in local currencies, and this reflects particularly -- particular strength in electronic services and Value-Added Services. 
International growth in local currencies was about 2.7%. We recently acquired RxWorks, a Practice Management Software company serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately $7 million. 
RxWorks brings Henry Schein an installed base of more than 1,500 veterinary clinics, strengthens our growing Practice Management Software business and of course, complements our expanding Animal Health technology business. And when I say that, it's all about interoperability and connectivity, the connection of our Practice Management Software, we believe by far the largest installed base with diagnostic equipment, which and other digitalized equipment as in Dental, where we made good progress in this area, we have made good progress in Animal Health, and we expect this to be a key driver of our business together with the data side. 
Let me talk about the data side for a minute. Early this year, we completed our acquisition of an 81% -- 80.1% interest in Vetstreet, a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. Vetstreet had sales in 2014 of about $43 million. We are particularly excited about the potential to prepare our Practice Management Software solutions with data analytics capability of Vetstreet which can offer valuable market insights to helping manufacturers and veterinarians improve the success of treatment of various kinds and business efficiency. 
We are particularly pleased with the expansion of our installed base, our Practice Management Software in the vet space, and our big data capabilities that we now will integrate into our platform as a result of the acquisition of Vetstreet. We believe we have the right team and the right vision to create real value for our suppliers and for our customers in the veterinary arena. 
Also, this past summer, Henry Schein, Cerner, Lidos and Accenture won a bid for the Department of Finance health care management system's modernization project. Henry Schein will provide Dental software and services with our Dentrix enterprise product. It is a privilege to be a part of this partnership aimed at improving the health care of our military, and our Dentrix enterprise software will allow for seamless sharing of Medical and Dental information in this community. 
We are pleased to join with these industry leaders for the ultimate benefit of the Armed Forces of the United States and believe that we will also be in a better position with the advancement of this contract to provide a wider variety of services to the larger practices in the developed world and potentially, even the developing world. Very, very exciting progress for Henry Schein's practice solutions business. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few of the highlights of last year. We are extremely pleased to have met or even exceeded many of the significant goals while advancing our strategic plan, of course, the strategic plan for 2015, '16 and '17. 
We did receive a number of awards and recognitions last year, very important for our team, who really -- who work very, very hard daily to meet the expectations or exceed the expectations of our suppliers and our customers. We were named to Fortune magazine's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the 14th consecutive year, being named 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute for the fourth consecutive year and being named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine in their inaugural ranking. We also were recognized by our commitment to diversity, cultural competency and health care equity by various Hispanics and LGBT organizations. 
It's all about people, and it's the people at Henry Schein that have grown this company into the largest provider of products and related services to office-based dental, medical and veterinary practitioners. And it's really terrific that our team is being recognized. We continued our climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies and now stand at #287. And in March, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology both are ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combine these passions when creating the Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. You can expect expansion of this kind of program through dental schools throughout the United States and, of course, in Canada and elsewhere. Also, during 2015, we announced a partnership with American College of Prosthetics -- Prosthodontics Education Foundation along with other dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. 
There is no question Henry Schein's #1 strategy is to advance our digitalized presence in the prosthetic arena, both in the lab, in the dental office, stand-alone scanners and full integrated systems all integrated into a chairside capability and into our Practice Management systems, both in the smaller practices, the larger practices and the dental schools of the world. 
And finally, after the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015, a number of public and private sector organizations, including Henry Schein, came together to develop a global supply chain framework to enhance pandemic preparedness and response. In the past year, these organizations have collaborated to develop a partnership called the Global Supply Network for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Once successfully launched, this supply network will serve a shared platform to save lives and form intervention planning and communicate critical information plus the lessons learned, so that the world's response to pandemic continuously improves. Henry Schein believes in public-private partnerships as a core value and a key part of our success. 
So with that overview of our quarterly and full year financials and operating performance, with a huge thanks to Team Schein, our suppliers and our customers, and of course, our investors, who we are committed to providing a reliable, continuous stream of income, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. 
And now, operator, we are ready to take questions."

First off, you talked about some basic equipment strength in the quarter. Wondering if you could maybe give it a little more color on what you're seeing in a couple of areas. I pointed DSOs, maybe the pace of business you're seeing there versus private practice. And maybe if you could talk about any benefits you might be seeing from one of your new basic equipment relationships. Is that opening up new business? Is that just replacing other branded sales you might have been making? And then just on the technology side of equipment, any commentary there as you pointed more to basic equipment than I think you did technology."

So yes, our traditional business has -- did very well. But let me hasten to point out that in January 2015, we did announce taking on the A-dec line, which we actually brought in around May. We did, I think, do well on the A-dec line. I believe we did live up to the expectations and perhaps even exceeded what was expected from us by A-dec, but let me hasten to say that we did well with our traditional suppliers that have supported us for decades, and in that context, overall we did well with the traditional equipment. Obviously, adding the A-dec line put stress on our organization from -- equipment organization and our field sales consultants from a learning point of view and from a service point of view, learning how to service the equipment and fine-tuning our design capabilities. All of that was well absorbed while maintaining the relationship with our branded manufacturers that have supported us for all these years. So I would say, overall, the manufacturers are pleased, and our sales organization is pleased, and now I am, of course, dealing with the United States and Canada. On the digital side and the high-tech side, I believe we made pretty good progress as well. We currently believe we're selling more than one of 3 new units in the CAD/CAM space, which is our #1 global strategy to advance digitalized prosthetics. We are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan offerings. Of course, I think you know Henry Schein is committed to open architecture to the extent suppliers provide us with the products. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression solutions and provides dentists with innovative -- what we believe, innovative, robust and efficient choices for students of dentistry. In addition, we continue to be well-positioned, we believe, and have made huge progress in the lab. So when you look at equipment, it's not only the equipment that is sold to the dentist but to the lab as well, and it's in the digital restorations that we outsource -- that providing solutions for the digital restorations that are outsourced to lab facilities that we also feel we are doing very well. So it's the entire spectrum of traditional equipment, including digital imaging, 3D, et cetera, sensors and, of course, the digital prosthetics that I think we have done very well, and we believe, overall, we have gained market share, balancing those suppliers that work with us over the years with A-dec. And I believe, we satisfied our obligation and more than satisfied our obligation across the board. We are particularly pleased with the level of integration between our Practice Solutions businesses, both at Dentrix and at Exan, which is the schools business. So overall, I think we are very pleased with the direction of our equipment business in the United States. You asked specifically about the large accounts. Yes, the top 50 accounts in the United States and our Special Markets group are very important to us, and we continue to do well in those -- in that space. Of course, there is competition. You know about it. Everybody's focused on this, but I believe we have very good solutions for these accounts. In addition, our mid-market group, which became quite active in the second half of the year, that's the group that is multiple locations -- that has multiple locations under common management and generally owned by a dentist versus the very large practices that are generally owned by financial sponsor or -- yes, they're no public companies, so financial sponsor. So we have covering both sides of the market as well as the -- so they're very big, the midsize and of course, the dental schools and other institutions. I believe that continues to do well for Henry Schein. And then internationally, we did well. We were actually very pleased with the fourth quarter and that the halo effect of the IDS continued into the fourth quarter, and we believe actually has spilled over into the first quarter. So overall, our equipment business throughout the world is doing quite well. I could go on and on and on, but I think that's probably enough."

So when you look at CAD/CAM, we're continuing to see good growth there. It was a little bit less overall than the 11.5% in North America, but the dynamic that we're seeing is really very strong growth on scanner only. We're still seeing full unit sales in addition to that, but there's been a little bit of a change in the market over the last year or 2, where customers are beginning to look at scan-onlys to start with, and then hopefully in the future, they'll add the milling machine. So that's been a nice opportunity for us. And the only other point I want to just to add is A-dec has helped the traditional equipment growth obviously. But the good news is that, and Stanley said this I believe, is that we haven't seen it cannibalize other equipment line. So we really do think that we're penetrating new customers with the A-dec product line for the most part, and that's also good news. That's not just swapping out other equipment lines."

Let me just give you a context and while I'm doing it, Steve can think through the specific numbers. But there were 2 component parts to this market. The first is specialty products per se, that are only used by specialists and used by those GPs that are doing specialty procedures. We're not talking about our oral surgery products, implants, bone regeneration, a few other specialty products. In the endodontics space, the endo-specific files related kinds of products and in the orthodontic space, the wires specifically and the brackets, and of course, the lines, which we don't really sell. But then, in addition to that, there are products that specialists purchase such as equipment and consumables and gloves and oral surgeons buy pharmaceutical products, et cetera, that we've always sold as part of our general core business. And I would say that business always tends to do a little bit better with expense of equipment, like the 3D x-ray, et cetera, because specialists, firstly, need these products, and secondly, they tend to make more money so they can afford more specialty products. When we talk about our specialty business we are referring to not that product, the general products, which are part of our core business and nor are we referring to the software in particular that's part of our software business, but we referring to the specialty products like implants, bone regeneration, wires and brackets and files, et cetera in the endo space. And in that space, it's hard for us to measure how the market is growing because no one compares what we compares, there's no like information.

So we have capabilities of connecting software to various devices, and scil, just our various businesses in Dental and Medical provides that capability. So -- and we're very pleased with that team really on these. And now you ask about large animal. Nothing's never, but we don't think distributing branded pharmaceuticals in mass on a logistics basis for large animals is really the best use of our capital. It's not too different to us years ago exiting the specialty pharma space, where there's huge amounts of sales available that are relatively large margin. Better for the drug wholesalers to do that than for us. So in the large animal space, we will continue to look for market opportunities. Some countries present the opportunity. For example, in the dairy industry, we're quite active in Ireland and parts of Europe and in particular, New Zealand. So there's an opportunity. The equine area, which is not really -- I suppose it would be large animals, but it's not really production animals as an area where we're very interested in and believe we can bring value. And then there are markets like Australia, New Zealand and pieces of Europe, where we believe that through our logistics, we add value that others don't add. So -- and then there will be unique products for the large animal. For example, Kruuse has, scil has, veterinary instruments, orthodontic -- orthopedic business provides. So we will be more selective to find areas that we could bring value, and this creates high-margin opportunity rather than shipping of massive amounts of low-margin branded pharmaceuticals."

We are delighted to report that sales growth during the fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we believe we gained market share on an overall basis during the quarter, both here in North America and, of course, internationally, as we successfully continued our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. 
We are especially pleased with our worldwide internal growth in local currencies for the quarter of 6.5%, which we're very pleased, represents the highest quarterly growth rate in 8 years. 
Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.67. This caps off a successful 2015 performance, with worldwide local internal sales growth of 5%, and adjusted EPS growth for the year -- for the full year of nearly 10%, and that is, of course, despite the continued negative impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
And looking into this year, into 2016, today, we are pleased to reaffirm our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to 2015 adjusted EPS. Of course, there is just no question that our almost 19,000 Team Schein Members around the world are working together as a team to execute on our 2015, '16 and '17 strategic plan.

In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent performance and business accomplishments, but first, Steven will review our financial results for the quarter and for the year."
339447,323541573,930620,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or",2054,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which would be excluding those restructuring costs as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes. Also, Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
So turning to our Q4 results. The net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2015, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 5.5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. This consisted of 10.3% growth in local currencies and a 4.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against this translation exposure. In local currencies or constant currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.5% which, as Stan just mentioned, was the highest in 8 years, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.8%. 
I'd also like to comment that based on our experience and what we're seeing in the end markets thus far in 2016, the overall dental, medical and animal health markets that we serve continue to reflect stable to an improving environment. You could also note the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit E of today's news release. 
The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 7.0%. That's a contraction of 47 basis points compared to last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5%, which is essentially unchanged versus the prior year. I'd also like to point out that on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin, excluding restructuring costs for the full year, expanded by 34 basis points, which is ahead of our stated goal. 
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1%, and on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, was 29.8%. This compares with 29.7% in last year's fourth quarter, and for 2016, we believe the effective tax rates will continue to be in the same 30% range. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $139.3 million or $1.67 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 4.7% and 7.1% respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. It's important to reiterate that foreign currency exchange continued to have a negative impact on our EPS, it was approximately $0.07 for the quarter and $0.26 for the full year. 
If we look at our results for the full year, there are a number of important highlights to report. We had 8.4% sales growth in local currencies, highlighted by 5.0% internal growth in constant currency. As I just said, we had operating margin expansion on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs of 34 basis points, and that represents our best annual operating margin expansion, also since 2008. 
We had diluted EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis of nearly 10%, and we're very pleased to have delivered on our original guidance despite the negative headwind of $0.26 per share related to foreign currency. Our operating cash flow was also strong at $586.8 million and exceeded our non-GAAP net income by $85 million. 
So, I guess, it's fair to sum it up and say we believe 2015 was truly an excellent year. Exhibit B of this morning's news release again reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and diluted EPS from continuing operations. 
If we look at our sales results for the fourth quarter, the Dental -- the Global Dental sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 1.5% to $1.4 billion. This 1.5% growth consisted of 7.3% growth in local currencies, offset by a 5.8% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 6.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.7%. Of this 6.6% internal growth in local currencies, we had North American growth of 7.6% and international growth of 4.9%. 
I'll quickly give you some additional detail between -- on each of those 2 numbers. First, the North American internal growth of 7.6% included 6.1% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 11.5% growth in the Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers in the quarter; while growth in equipment sales and service revenues related to particular strength in traditional equipment for us. 
If we look at our international growth of 4.9% internal growth in constant currencies, that included 4.0% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 7.0% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. The consumable merchandise sales growth was led by strong performance in a number of countries, including France and the U.K., and the equipment sales and service revenue growth was led by a number of countries, also including Germany, Australia, Austria and the U.K. 
Turning to our Animal Health business. Sales were $756.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.4%. This included growth of 9.5% in local currencies, offset by a 6.1% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 2.3%, while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.2% to growth. Of that 2.3% internal growth, the components were 1.2% growth in North America and 3.3% growth, international -- on our international business. It's important to note that the 1.2% growth in North America was actually 8.4% growth when we normalize for results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, as well as when excluding sales of diagnostic products in both the current- and prior-year periods due to the changes in the veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. We believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. 
I'd also like to mention that Q4 2015 -- that this Q4 2015 result will be the last quarter that we'll be adjusting for sales of diagnostic products since they've now annualized. However, we will continue to normalize our sales results to account for any switches between agency sales and direct sales on an ongoing basis if that's significant. 
If we look at our Medical sales, they were $561.6 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of 21.6% and consisted of 22.2% growth in local currencies, offset by a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 13.4%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 8.8% to our growth. 
If we look at North American sales growth, it was really very strong at 23.2%, including internal sales growth of 14.0%. Here also, when you normalize for the impact of agency sales, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 10.2%, resulting in the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth for our North American Medical business, and we're continuing to see a nice success in both large group practices and IDNs. 
If we look at our influenza vaccine sales, they were $20 million for the fourth quarter. That's down approximately 23% versus the prior year's quarter, but that's primarily due to timing, and on a full year basis, our influenza vaccine sales were relatively consistent versus the prior year. 
For the past year, we believe we've been outperforming the medical market by a significant margin as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices. I'll also note that the international Medical sales, which is a small part of our Medical Group, saw a slight decline of 0.3% in constant currencies for the quarter. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added sales -- Value-Add Services sales, they were $93.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.8%. This included 4.5% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline -- 1.7% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we saw internally generated sales increase 4% and acquisition growth was an additional 0.5%. The components of that 4% internal growth in constant currencies was 4.2% in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Through some product upgrade enhancements, strategic acquisitions and the advanced technology products and services we offer, they provide really for efficient delivery of health care services, and we believe there are new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups. 
Looking at some other factors. We continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we bought about 1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $146.90, which was approximately $149 million and this impact of the repurchase for the fourth quarter was less than $0.01 on our EPS. 
For the full year 2015, we repurchased $300 million of our stock, representing 2.1 million shares at an average price of $143.86 per share, and that's in line at the high end of our stated goals. At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and as we noted when we -- that authorization was received, for the past 4 years, we've been repurchasing about $300 million a year, and in recognition of the company being a larger company, larger market cap, stronger cash flow, our Board of Directors recently improved this increase to $400 million. 
We continue to believe our capital allocation strategy that deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and acquisitions, continues to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we take a look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, operating cash flow for the quarter was just under $300 million compared with $274 million last year. And for the year, the operating cash flow was again $586 million and free cash flow, over $0.5 billion at $515 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow. Our working capital accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 39.3 days. That compares to 39 days for the quarter -- of the last year's quarter. Inventory turns were 5.6 turns for the quarter. That compares to 5.9 turns in last year's fourth quarter. 
And finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. So for 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents a growth of 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of 2015 of $5.96. 
As is always for us, our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS is for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which we expect to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per diluted share in the first half of 2016. 
Finally, I'd like to note something that I think is important. If we look at our quarterly progression, the adjusted diluted EPS growth for Q1 2016 is expected to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits versus the prior year. Historically, sales are lowest in the first quarter of each year, operating expenses as a percentage of sales are generally highest since certain fixed expenses and nonvariable compensation expenses are recorded relatively evenly throughout the year. 
Over the course of the year, we expect to realize efficiencies through the restructuring, as well as get leverage on our infrastructure, as well as get synergies on recent acquisitions. So for that reason again, we expect Q1 to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits growth of EPS. Again, this growth assumes for the full year that exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. We haven't seen really very wide volatility in that at this point, but we're continuing to watch exchange rates. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with Dental group. I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in North America, internatio",2245,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with Dental group. 
I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in North America, internationally and for the group as a whole were all at multiyear highs. In North America, consumable merchandise internal growth in local currencies of 6.1% was particularly strong, highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in the local -- in local currencies of 11.5% also was, in our view, excellent and reflected strength in sales of traditional equipment. International consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew by 4%. International equipment sales and service internal sales growth in local currencies was a solid 7%. 
So let me point out that our Global Dental sales growth in local currencies for the full year was 5% as we continue to gain market share globally. This growth was well balanced between our North American and international businesses. 
A notable acquisition in our Dental group during 2015 was our 90% ownership in Dental Trey of Italy, which I discussed during last quarter's call. Dental Trey had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately USD 49 million and complements our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relationships. Of course, they are particularly strong in the KOL and education areas, the key opinion leader area and education of dentists. 
I'm very excited that we recently signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a distributor of dental supplies and equipment in Brazil. This investment will build upon our existing business in Brazil, which we established in 2014.  Brazil's dental market is fueled by an aging population and a growing middle class that recognizes the importance of oral care. With 2015 sales of approximately USD 70 million, Dental Cremer serves approximately 60,000 dental practitioners across Brazil, an important opportunity for us to sell additional products to an excellent customer base. We look forward to welcoming the Dental Cremer team to Team Schein once the transaction closes, which we expect to be towards the latter half of 2016 -- or the first half -- the latter part of the first half of 2016. 
Now, on the Animal Health group side. Normalized internal growth in local currencies was 5.6% for the quarter, including 8.4% growth in North America. Growth in our North American group also continues to benefit from strategic acquisitions and investment, and 2015 was an active year, in particular in Europe. 
We expanded our equipment capabilities through the purchase of scil animal care. scil sells services and supports laboratory and imaging diagnostic products to veterinarians in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, and has a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. We're particularly pleased with this acquisition as it will, no doubt, advance our global presence in the animal health diagnostic field given the terrific knowhow that the scil team has and their great product offering and the relationship with many suppliers in this field, who are really itching to get involved in the global diagnostic field seeking a channel. And scil provides that outstanding channel in conjunction with our distribution outlets in North America, Europe and actually, shortly, in Hong Kong, where we will launch our first Asia Animal Health presence and, of course, our significant presence in Australia and New Zealand. So this whole opportunity of scil, which had sales of approximately $75 million for the full year of 2015, gives us really a strategic benefit in the animal health space to advanced diagnostics and equipment. 
During the year, we acquired an 85% interest in KRUUSE, a leading distributor of veterinary suppliers in the Nordic countries and globally through a worldwide distribution network. KRUUSE had sales in 2014 of approximately USD 90 million. With this investment, we extended Henry Schein's presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but more importantly, the broad offering through the KRUUSE portfolio of products, which is well received in the markets that are currently served, will present a huge base to expand our unique products in the countries we are -- that KRUUSE is already serving, but also taking this product line globally. 
We plan to expand our distribution of these products across our Global Animal Health platform. Many of our companies do not sell the KRUUSE line yet, which is in line with our strategy to offer choices to our customers so that they can select the products that best fit the specific needs of their practice. 
Also, in 2015, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, which is a leading animal health distributor in Romania. Maravet had sales of about USD 23 million. With the acquisition of scil, KRUUSE and Maravet, Henry Schein's Animal Health business expanded to 23 countries. 
Now, let me turn to our Medical Group. As Steven mentioned, double-digit North American sales growth was quite robust during the quarter, and I'd like to make some general comments about this business. 
You may recall that we announced a strategic agreement with Cardinal in late November of 2014. This strategic agreement was borne out of a vision to offer a seamless solution that supports improved care, increased customer satisfaction and lower costs for acute and non-acute sides of care, and specifically where the 2, the acute and non-acute sides, have common ownership. 
Both Henry Schein and Cardinal have extensive experience in providing service to our communities across the United States. We are using our experience and expertise to provide resources that we believe will drive better outcomes across the continuum of care. By leveraging our respective strengths, we are providing powerful solutions, we believe, including a wide breadth of products, analytics and other tools for smaller customers to the very largest customers in this country, including the rapidly growing IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We believe the value proposition provided by Henry Schein and Cardinal can maximize the success of our customers through our best-in-class service capabilities, help the system touch-points and, of course, the product offering. 
Looking at the terrific progress we have made to date, our sales teams have continued to make joint customer presentations, and the reception has been quite positive. The transition of Cardinal's physician-related ultimate care customers to the Henry Schein platform is substantially complete, and we remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers by being uniquely positioned to jointly solve a broad continuum of health care along with Cardinal Health. 
During the fourth quarter, we further expanded the breadth of value-added products we made available to our Medical customers, with 2 agreements in particular, that I would like to highlight today. We were named by Medtronic as exclusive distributor for certain diabetes products to primary care physicians in the U.S. Also, we entered into a nonexclusive agreement with Cepheid to distribute their GeneXpert System, which to date has been largely targeted and available to U.S. hospital labs. 
I think you can expect Henry Schein to add significant numbers of value-added services and expand our offering in the medical arena in the years to come. 
Now, let me conclude my business review with Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.2% in local currencies, and this reflects particularly -- particular strength in electronic services and Value-Added Services. 
International growth in local currencies was about 2.7%. We recently acquired RxWorks, a practice management software company serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately $7 million. 
RxWorks brings Henry Schein an installed base of more than 1,500 veterinary clinics, strengthens our growing practice management software business and, of course, complements our expanding Animal Health technology business. And when I say that, it's all about interoperability and connectivity, the connection of our practice management software, we believe by far the largest installed base, with diagnostic equipment, which -- and other digitalized equipment. As in Dental, where we made good progress in this area, we have made good progress in Animal Health, and we expect this to be a key driver of our business together with the data side. 
Let me talk about the data side for a minute. Early this year, we completed our acquisition of an 81% -- 80.1% interest in Vetstreet, a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. Vetstreet had sales in 2014 of about $43 million. We are particularly excited about the potential to prepare our practice management software solutions with the data analytics capability of Vetstreet which can offer valuable market insights to helping manufacturers and veterinarians improve the success of treatment of various kinds and business efficiency. 
We are particularly pleased with the expansion of our installed base, our practice management software in the vet space and our big data capabilities that we now will integrate into our platform as a result of the acquisition of Vetstreet. We believe we have the right team and the right vision to create real value for our suppliers and for our customers in the veterinary arena. 
Also, this past summer, Henry Schein, Cerner, Lidos and Accenture won a bid for the Department of Defense Healthcare Management Systems Modernization project. Henry Schein will provide dental software and services with our Dentrix Enterprise product. It is a privilege to be a part of this partnership aimed at improving the health care of our military, and our Dentrix Enterprise software will allow for seamless sharing of medical and dental information in this community. 
We are pleased to join with these industry leaders for the ultimate benefit of the Armed Forces of the United States and believe that we will also be in a better position, with the advancement of this contract, to provide a wider variety of services to the larger practices in the developed world and potentially, even the developing world; very, very exciting progress for Henry Schein's Practice Solutions business. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few of the highlights of last year. We are extremely pleased to have met or even exceeded many of the significant goals while advancing our strategic plan, of course, the strategic plan for 2015, '16 and '17. 
We did receive a number of awards and recognitions last year, very important for our team, who really -- who worked very, very hard daily to meet the expectations or exceed the expectations of our suppliers and our customers. We were named to Fortune magazine's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the 14th consecutive year, being named 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute for the fourth consecutive year and being named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine in their inaugural ranking. We also were recognized for our commitment to diversity, cultural competency and health care equity by various Hispanics and LGBT organizations. 
It's all about people, and it's the people of Henry Schein that have grown this company into the largest provider of products and related services to office-based dental, medical and veterinary practitioners. And it's really terrific that our team is being recognized. We continued our climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies and now stand at #287. And in March, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology both are ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combined these passions when creating the Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. You can expect expansion of this kind of program through dental schools throughout the United States and, of course, in Canada and elsewhere. 
Also, during 2015, we announced a partnership with American College of Prosthetics -- Prosthodontics Education Foundation along with other dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. 
There is no question Henry Schein's #1 strategy is to advance our digitalized presence in the prosthetic arena, both in the lab, in the dental office, stand-alone scanners and full integrated systems all integrated into a chairside capability and into our practice management systems, both in the smaller practices, the larger practices and the dental schools of the world. 
And finally, after the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015, a number of public and private sector organizations, including Henry Schein, came together to develop a global supply chain framework to enhance pandemic preparedness and response. In the past year, these organizations have collaborated to develop a partnership called the Global Supply Network for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Once successfully launched, this supply network will serve a shared platform to save lives and form intervention planning and communicate critical information, plus disseminate lessons learned, so that the world's response to pandemic continuously improves. Henry Schein believes in public-private partnerships as a core value and a key part of our success. 
So with that overview of our quarterly and full year financials and operating performance, with a huge thanks to Team Schein, our suppliers and our customers and, of course, our investors who we are committed to providing a reliable, continuous stream of income, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. 
And now, operator, we're ready to take questions."

First off, you talked about some basic equipment strength in the quarter. Wondering if you could maybe give a little more color on what you're seeing in a couple of areas. I'd point to DSOs, maybe the pace of business you're seeing there versus private practice. And maybe, if you could talk about any benefits you might be seeing from one of your new basic equipment relationships. Is that opening up new business? Is that just replacing other branded sales you might have been making? And then, just on the technology side of equipment, any commentary there as you pointed more to basic equipment than I think you did technology?"

So yes, our traditional business has -- did very well. But let me hasten to point out that in January 2015, we did announce taking on the A-dec line, which we actually brought in around May. We did, I think, do well on the A-dec line. I believe we did live up to the expectations and perhaps even exceeded what was expected from us by A-dec. But let me hasten to say that we did well with our traditional suppliers that have supported us for decades, and in that context, overall we did well with the traditional equipment. Obviously, adding the A-dec line put stress on our organization from -- equipment organization and our field sales consultants from a learning point of view and from a service point of view, learning how to service the equipment and fine-tuning our design capabilities. All of that was well absorbed while maintaining the relationship with our branded manufacturers that have supported us for all these years. So I would say, overall, the manufacturers are pleased, and our sales organization is pleased, and now I am, of course, dealing with the United States and Canada. On the digital side and the high-tech side, I believe we made pretty good progress as well. We currently believe we're selling more than 1 of 3 new units in the CAD/CAM space, which is our #1 global strategy to advance digitalized prosthetics. We are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan offerings. Of course, I think you know Henry Schein is committed to open architecture to the extent suppliers provide us with the products. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression solutions and provides dentists with innovative -- what we believe, innovative, robust and efficient choices for a scholar [ph] of dentistry. In addition, we continue to be well-positioned, we believe, and have made huge progress in the lab. So when you look at equipment, it's not only the equipment that is sold to the dentist but to the lab as well, and it's in the digital restorations that we outsource to -- that provide solutions for the digital restorations that are outsourced to lab facilities that we also feel we are doing very well. So it's the entire spectrum of traditional equipment, including digital imaging, 3D, et cetera, sensors and, of course, the digital prosthetics that I think we have done very well, and we believe, overall, we have gained market share, balancing those suppliers that work with us over the years with A-dec. And I believe, we've satisfied our obligation and more than satisfied our obligation across the board. We are particularly pleased with the level of integration between our Practice Solutions businesses, both at Dentrix and at Exan, which is the schools business. So overall, I think we are very pleased with the direction of our equipment business in the United States. You ask specifically about the large accounts. Yes, the top 50 accounts in the United States and our Special Markets group are very important to us, and we continue to do well in those -- in that space. Of course, there is competition. You know about it. Everybody's focused on this, but I believe we have very good solutions for these accounts. In addition, our mid-market group, which became quite active in the second half of the year, that's the group that is multiple locations -- that has multiple locations under common management and generally owned by a dentist versus the very large practices that are generally owned by a financial sponsor or -- yes, there're no public companies, so financial sponsor. So we have covering both sides of the markets as well as the -- so they're very big, the midsize and, of course, the dental schools and other institutions. I believe that continues to do well for Henry Schein. And then internationally, we did well. We were actually very pleased with the fourth quarter in that the halo effect of the IDS continued into the fourth quarter, and we believe actually has spilt over into the first quarter. So overall, our equipment business throughout the world is doing quite well. I could go on and on and on, but I think that's probably enough."

So when you look at CAD/CAM, we're continuing to see good growth there. It was a little bit less overall than the 11.5% in North America, but the dynamic that we're seeing is really very strong growth on scanner only. We're still seeing full unit sales in addition to that, but there's been a little bit of a change in the market over the last year or 2, where customers are beginning to look at scan-onlys to start with, and then hopefully in the future, they'll add the milling machine. So that's been a nice opportunity for us. And the only other point I wanted to just to add is A-dec has helped the traditional equipment growth obviously. But the good news is that -- and Stanley said this I believe, is that we haven't seen it cannibalize other equipment lines. So we really do think that we're penetrating new customers with the A-dec product line for the most part, and that's also good news. That's not just swapping out other equipment lines."

Let me just give you a context and while I'm doing that, Steven can think through the specific numbers. But there are 2 component parts to this market. The first is specialty products per se, that are only used by specialists and used by those GPs that are doing specialty procedures. We're not talking about our oral surgery products, implants, bone regeneration, a few other specialty products. In the endodontic space, the endo-specific files related kinds of products and in the orthodontic space, the wires specifically and the brackets, and of course, the liners, which we don't really sell. But then, in addition to that, there are products that specialists purchase such as equipment and consumables and gloves and oral surgeons buy pharmaceutical products, et cetera, that we've always sold as part of our general core business. And I would say that business always tends to do a little bit better with expense of equipment, like the 3D x-ray, et cetera, because specialists, firstly, need these products, and secondly, they tend to make more money so they can afford more specialty products. When we talk about our specialty business, we are referring to not that product, the general products, which are part of our core business and nor are we referring to the software in particular, that's part of our software business, but we referring to the specialty products like implants, bone regeneration, wires and brackets and files, et cetera in the endo space. And in that space, it's hard for us to measure how the market is growing because no one compares what we -- compares, there's no like information.

Thank you, Steven.

So we have capabilities of connecting software to various devices, and scil, just our various businesses in Dental and Medical, provides that capability. So -- and we're very pleased with that team really on these. And now you ask about large animal. Nothing's never, but we don't think distributing branded pharmaceuticals in mass on a logistics basis for large animals is really the best use of our capital. It's not too different to us years ago exiting the specialty pharma space, where there's huge amounts of sales available that are relatively large margin; better for the drug wholesalers to do that than for us. So in the large animal space, we will continue to look for market opportunities. Some countries present an opportunity. For example, in the dairy industry, we're quite active in Ireland and parts of Europe and in particular, New Zealand. So there's an opportunity. The equine area, which is not really -- I suppose it would be large animals, but it's not really production animals, is an area we're very interested in and believe we can bring value. And then there are markets like Australia, New Zealand and pieces of Europe, where we believe that through our logistics, we add value that others don't add. So -- and then there will be unique products for the large animal that, for example, KRUUSE has, scil has, veterinary instruments, orthodontic -- orthopedic business provides. So we will be more selective to find areas that we could bring value, and this creates high-margin opportunity rather than shipping of masses amounts of low-margin branded pharmaceuticals."

And also, I think whether for you guys or for the industry just thinking ahead to -- for 2016, the upcoming 4Q '16 given that the start had been renewed, I think, for a couple of years, how do we think about that year-over-year comp for North American Dental equipment 4Q '16 versus 4Q '15 just in terms of whether it's a normalized comparison, just any thoughts on that as well?"

Our year-end was just before Christmas I believe, because that's the way our calendar works, and we had about 3 days to -- or 4 days or 3.5 business days to use the 179. Our sales organization had given up being able to really cultivate relationship space for equipment -- specific equipment using 179, and you needed really complete plug and play. So for example, CAD/CAM couldn't work and big traditional equipment couldn't work; maybe a few x-rays could work here and there. But it had very little impact for 2015. Assuming that Congress keeps it in place this year, I think it'll be a very good opportunity for the end of 2016. Steven, any more information?"

This provision actually has been made permanent. So unless Congress decides to repeal it during 2016, it should be available in fourth quarter 2016 and ongoing, and the benefit is the first $500,000 of equipment that qualified small businesses buy can be expensed in the year that they buy it. So again, we think it could be a nice benefit for Q4 of '16."

We are delighted to report that sales growth during the fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we believe we gained market share on an overall basis during the quarter, both here in North America and, of course, internationally, as we successfully continued our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. 
We are especially pleased with our worldwide internal growth in local currencies for the quarter of 6.5%, which we're very pleased, represents the highest quarterly growth rate in 8 years. 
Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.67. This caps off a successful 2015 performance, with worldwide local internal sales growth of 5%, and adjusted EPS growth for the year -- for the full year of nearly 10%, and that is, of course, despite the continued negative impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
And looking into this year, into 2016, today, we are pleased to reaffirm our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to 2015 adjusted EPS. Of course, there is just no question that our almost 19,000 Team Schein Members around the world are working together as a team to execute on our 2015, '16 and '17 strategic plan.

In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent performance and business accomplishments, but first, Steven will review our financial results for the quarter and for the year."
339447,323541573,930872,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or",2054,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also very pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that the 2015 fourth quarter results include restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which would be excluding those restructuring costs as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes. Also, Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
So turning to our Q4 results. The net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2015, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 5.5% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. This consisted of 10.3% growth in local currencies and a 4.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against this translation exposure. In local currencies or constant currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.5% which, as Stan just mentioned, was the highest in 8 years, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.8%. 
I'd also like to comment that based on our experience and what we're seeing in the end markets thus far in 2016, the overall dental, medical and animal health markets that we serve continue to reflect stable to an improving environment. You could also note the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit E of today's news release. 
The operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 7.0%. That's a contraction of 47 basis points compared to last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, the adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5%, which is essentially unchanged versus the prior year. I'd also like to point out that on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margin, excluding restructuring costs for the full year, expanded by 34 basis points, which is ahead of our stated goal. 
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1%, and on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, was 29.8%. This compares with 29.7% in last year's fourth quarter, and for 2016, we believe the effective tax rates will continue to be in the same 30% range. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $139.3 million or $1.67 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 4.7% and 7.1% respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. It's important to reiterate that foreign currency exchange continued to have a negative impact on our EPS, it was approximately $0.07 for the quarter and $0.26 for the full year. 
If we look at our results for the full year, there are a number of important highlights to report. We had 8.4% sales growth in local currencies, highlighted by 5.0% internal growth in constant currency. As I just said, we had operating margin expansion on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs of 34 basis points, and that represents our best annual operating margin expansion, also since 2008. 
We had diluted EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis of nearly 10%, and we're very pleased to have delivered on our original guidance despite the negative headwind of $0.26 per share related to foreign currency. Our operating cash flow was also strong at $586.8 million and exceeded our non-GAAP net income by $85 million. 
So, I guess, it's fair to sum it up and say we believe 2015 was truly an excellent year. Exhibit B of this morning's news release again reconciles GAAP and non-GAAP income and diluted EPS from continuing operations. 
If we look at our sales results for the fourth quarter, the Dental -- the Global Dental sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 1.5% to $1.4 billion. This 1.5% growth consisted of 7.3% growth in local currencies, offset by a 5.8% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 6.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.7%. Of this 6.6% internal growth in local currencies, we had North American growth of 7.6% and international growth of 4.9%. 
I'll quickly give you some additional detail between -- on each of those 2 numbers. First, the North American internal growth of 7.6% included 6.1% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 11.5% growth in the Dental equipment sales and service revenue. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers in the quarter; while growth in equipment sales and service revenues related to particular strength in traditional equipment for us. 
If we look at our international growth of 4.9% internal growth in constant currencies, that included 4.0% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 7.0% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. The consumable merchandise sales growth was led by strong performance in a number of countries, including France and the U.K., and the equipment sales and service revenue growth was led by a number of countries, also including Germany, Australia, Austria and the U.K. 
Turning to our Animal Health business. Sales were $756.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.4%. This included growth of 9.5% in local currencies, offset by a 6.1% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 2.3%, while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.2% to growth. Of that 2.3% internal growth, the components were 1.2% growth in North America and 3.3% growth, international -- on our international business. It's important to note that the 1.2% growth in North America was actually 8.4% growth when we normalize for results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, as well as when excluding sales of diagnostic products in both the current- and prior-year periods due to the changes in the veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. We believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. 
I'd also like to mention that Q4 2015 -- that this Q4 2015 result will be the last quarter that we'll be adjusting for sales of diagnostic products since they've now annualized. However, we will continue to normalize our sales results to account for any switches between agency sales and direct sales on an ongoing basis if that's significant. 
If we look at our Medical sales, they were $561.6 million in the fourth quarter. That's an increase of 21.6% and consisted of 22.2% growth in local currencies, offset by a 0.6% decline related to foreign currency. The internal sales in local currencies grew 13.4%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 8.8% to our growth. 
If we look at North American sales growth, it was really very strong at 23.2%, including internal sales growth of 14.0%. Here also, when you normalize for the impact of agency sales, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 10.2%, resulting in the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth for our North American Medical business, and we're continuing to see a nice success in both large group practices and IDNs. 
If we look at our influenza vaccine sales, they were $20 million for the fourth quarter. That's down approximately 23% versus the prior year's quarter, but that's primarily due to timing, and on a full year basis, our influenza vaccine sales were relatively consistent versus the prior year. 
For the past year, we believe we've been outperforming the medical market by a significant margin as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices. I'll also note that the international Medical sales, which is a small part of our Medical Group, saw a slight decline of 0.3% in constant currencies for the quarter. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added sales -- Value-Add Services sales, they were $93.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.8%. This included 4.5% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline -- 1.7% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we saw internally generated sales increase 4% and acquisition growth was an additional 0.5%. The components of that 4% internal growth in constant currencies was 4.2% in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Through some product upgrade enhancements, strategic acquisitions and the advanced technology products and services we offer, they provide really for efficient delivery of health care services, and we believe there are new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups. 
Looking at some other factors. We continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we bought about 1 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $146.90, which was approximately $149 million and this impact of the repurchase for the fourth quarter was less than $0.01 on our EPS. 
For the full year 2015, we repurchased $300 million of our stock, representing 2.1 million shares at an average price of $143.86 per share, and that's in line at the high end of our stated goals. At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and as we noted when we -- that authorization was received, for the past 4 years, we've been repurchasing about $300 million a year, and in recognition of the company being a larger company, larger market cap, stronger cash flow, our Board of Directors recently improved this increase to $400 million. 
We continue to believe our capital allocation strategy that deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and acquisitions, continues to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we take a look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, operating cash flow for the quarter was just under $300 million compared with $274 million last year. And for the year, the operating cash flow was again $586 million and free cash flow, over $0.5 billion at $515 million. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to have exceeded our goals related to cash flow. Our working capital accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 39.3 days. That compares to 39 days for the quarter -- of the last year's quarter. Inventory turns were 5.6 turns for the quarter. That compares to 5.9 turns in last year's fourth quarter. 
And finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. So for 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents a growth of 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of 2015 of $5.96. 
As is always for us, our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS is for continuing operations, as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which we expect to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per diluted share in the first half of 2016. 
Finally, I'd like to note something that I think is important. If we look at our quarterly progression, the adjusted diluted EPS growth for Q1 2016 is expected to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits versus the prior year. Historically, sales are lowest in the first quarter of each year, operating expenses as a percentage of sales are generally highest since certain fixed expenses and nonvariable compensation expenses are recorded relatively evenly throughout the year. 
Over the course of the year, we expect to realize efficiencies through the restructuring, as well as get leverage on our infrastructure, as well as get synergies on recent acquisitions. So for that reason again, we expect Q1 to be in the mid- to possibly high single digits growth of EPS. Again, this growth assumes for the full year that exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. We haven't seen really very wide volatility in that at this point, but we're continuing to watch exchange rates. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with Dental group. I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in North America, internatio",2245,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups for both the quarter and the year, starting with Dental group. 
I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter internal Dental sales growth in local currencies in North America, internationally and for the group as a whole were all at multiyear highs. In North America, consumable merchandise internal growth in local currencies of 6.1% was particularly strong, highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to our special market customers. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in the local -- in local currencies of 11.5% also was, in our view, excellent and reflected strength in sales of traditional equipment. International consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew by 4%. International equipment sales and service internal sales growth in local currencies was a solid 7%. 
So let me point out that our Global Dental sales growth in local currencies for the full year was 5% as we continue to gain market share globally. This growth was well balanced between our North American and international businesses. 
A notable acquisition in our Dental group during 2015 was our 90% ownership in Dental Trey of Italy, which I discussed during last quarter's call. Dental Trey had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately USD 49 million and complements our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relationships. Of course, they are particularly strong in the KOL and education areas, the key opinion leader area and education of dentists. 
I'm very excited that we recently signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a distributor of dental supplies and equipment in Brazil. This investment will build upon our existing business in Brazil, which we established in 2014.  Brazil's dental market is fueled by an aging population and a growing middle class that recognizes the importance of oral care. With 2015 sales of approximately USD 70 million, Dental Cremer serves approximately 60,000 dental practitioners across Brazil, an important opportunity for us to sell additional products to an excellent customer base. We look forward to welcoming the Dental Cremer team to Team Schein once the transaction closes, which we expect to be towards the latter half of 2016 -- or the first half -- the latter part of the first half of 2016. 
Now, on the Animal Health group side. Normalized internal growth in local currencies was 5.6% for the quarter, including 8.4% growth in North America. Growth in our North American group also continues to benefit from strategic acquisitions and investment, and 2015 was an active year, in particular in Europe. 
We expanded our equipment capabilities through the purchase of scil animal care. scil sells services and supports laboratory and imaging diagnostic products to veterinarians in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, and has a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. We're particularly pleased with this acquisition as it will, no doubt, advance our global presence in the animal health diagnostic field given the terrific knowhow that the scil team has and their great product offering and the relationship with many suppliers in this field, who are really itching to get involved in the global diagnostic field seeking a channel. And scil provides that outstanding channel in conjunction with our distribution outlets in North America, Europe and actually, shortly, in Hong Kong, where we will launch our first Asia Animal Health presence and, of course, our significant presence in Australia and New Zealand. So this whole opportunity of scil, which had sales of approximately $75 million for the full year of 2015, gives us really a strategic benefit in the animal health space to advanced diagnostics and equipment. 
During the year, we acquired an 85% interest in KRUUSE, a leading distributor of veterinary suppliers in the Nordic countries and globally through a worldwide distribution network. KRUUSE had sales in 2014 of approximately USD 90 million. With this investment, we extended Henry Schein's presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but more importantly, the broad offering through the KRUUSE portfolio of products, which is well received in the markets that are currently served, will present a huge base to expand our unique products in the countries we are -- that KRUUSE is already serving, but also taking this product line globally. 
We plan to expand our distribution of these products across our Global Animal Health platform. Many of our companies do not sell the KRUUSE line yet, which is in line with our strategy to offer choices to our customers so that they can select the products that best fit the specific needs of their practice. 
Also, in 2015, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, which is a leading animal health distributor in Romania. Maravet had sales of about USD 23 million. With the acquisition of scil, KRUUSE and Maravet, Henry Schein's Animal Health business expanded to 23 countries. 
Now, let me turn to our Medical Group. As Steven mentioned, double-digit North American sales growth was quite robust during the quarter, and I'd like to make some general comments about this business. 
You may recall that we announced a strategic agreement with Cardinal in late November of 2014. This strategic agreement was borne out of a vision to offer a seamless solution that supports improved care, increased customer satisfaction and lower costs for acute and non-acute sides of care, and specifically where the 2, the acute and non-acute sides, have common ownership. 
Both Henry Schein and Cardinal have extensive experience in providing service to our communities across the United States. We are using our experience and expertise to provide resources that we believe will drive better outcomes across the continuum of care. By leveraging our respective strengths, we are providing powerful solutions, we believe, including a wide breadth of products, analytics and other tools for smaller customers to the very largest customers in this country, including the rapidly growing IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We believe the value proposition provided by Henry Schein and Cardinal can maximize the success of our customers through our best-in-class service capabilities, help the system touch-points and, of course, the product offering. 
Looking at the terrific progress we have made to date, our sales teams have continued to make joint customer presentations, and the reception has been quite positive. The transition of Cardinal's physician-related ultimate care customers to the Henry Schein platform is substantially complete, and we remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers by being uniquely positioned to jointly solve a broad continuum of health care along with Cardinal Health. 
During the fourth quarter, we further expanded the breadth of value-added products we made available to our Medical customers, with 2 agreements in particular, that I would like to highlight today. We were named by Medtronic as exclusive distributor for certain diabetes products to primary care physicians in the U.S. Also, we entered into a nonexclusive agreement with Cepheid to distribute their GeneXpert System, which to date has been largely targeted and available to U.S. hospital labs. 
I think you can expect Henry Schein to add significant numbers of value-added services and expand our offering in the medical arena in the years to come. 
Now, let me conclude my business review with Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.2% in local currencies, and this reflects particularly -- particular strength in electronic services and Value-Added Services. 
International growth in local currencies was about 2.7%. We recently acquired RxWorks, a practice management software company serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks had sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately $7 million. 
RxWorks brings Henry Schein an installed base of more than 1,500 veterinary clinics, strengthens our growing practice management software business and, of course, complements our expanding Animal Health technology business. And when I say that, it's all about interoperability and connectivity, the connection of our practice management software, we believe by far the largest installed base, with diagnostic equipment, which -- and other digitalized equipment. As in Dental, where we made good progress in this area, we have made good progress in Animal Health, and we expect this to be a key driver of our business together with the data side. 
Let me talk about the data side for a minute. Early this year, we completed our acquisition of an 81% -- 80.1% interest in Vetstreet, a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. Vetstreet had sales in 2014 of about $43 million. We are particularly excited about the potential to prepare our practice management software solutions with the data analytics capability of Vetstreet which can offer valuable market insights to helping manufacturers and veterinarians improve the success of treatment of various kinds and business efficiency. 
We are particularly pleased with the expansion of our installed base, our practice management software in the vet space and our big data capabilities that we now will integrate into our platform as a result of the acquisition of Vetstreet. We believe we have the right team and the right vision to create real value for our suppliers and for our customers in the veterinary arena. 
Also, this past summer, Henry Schein, Cerner, Leidos and Accenture won a bid for the Department of Defense Healthcare Management Systems Modernization project. Henry Schein will provide dental software and services with our Dentrix Enterprise product. It is a privilege to be a part of this partnership aimed at improving the health care of our military, and our Dentrix Enterprise software will allow for seamless sharing of medical and dental information in this community. 
We are pleased to join with these industry leaders for the ultimate benefit of the Armed Forces of the United States and believe that we will also be in a better position, with the advancement of this contract, to provide a wider variety of services to the larger practices in the developed world and potentially, even the developing world; very, very exciting progress for Henry Schein's Practice Solutions business. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few of the highlights of last year. We are extremely pleased to have met or even exceeded many of the significant goals while advancing our strategic plan, of course, the strategic plan for 2015, '16 and '17. 
We did receive a number of awards and recognitions last year, very important for our team, who really -- who worked very, very hard daily to meet the expectations or exceed the expectations of our suppliers and our customers. We were named to Fortune magazine's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the 14th consecutive year, being named 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute for the fourth consecutive year and being named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine in their inaugural ranking. We also were recognized for our commitment to diversity, cultural competency and health care equity by various Hispanics and LGBT organizations. 
It's all about people, and it's the people of Henry Schein that have grown this company into the largest provider of products and related services to office-based dental, medical and veterinary practitioners. And it's really terrific that our team is being recognized. We continued our climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies and now stand at #287. And in March, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology both are ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combined these passions when creating the Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. You can expect expansion of this kind of program through dental schools throughout the United States and, of course, in Canada and elsewhere. 
Also, during 2015, we announced a partnership with American College of Prosthetics -- Prosthodontics Education Foundation along with other dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. 
There is no question Henry Schein's #1 strategy is to advance our digitalized presence in the prosthetic arena, both in the lab, in the dental office, stand-alone scanners and full integrated systems all integrated into a chairside capability and into our practice management systems, both in the smaller practices, the larger practices and the dental schools of the world. 
And finally, after the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015, a number of public and private sector organizations, including Henry Schein, came together to develop a global supply chain framework to enhance pandemic preparedness and response. In the past year, these organizations have collaborated to develop a partnership called the Global Supply Network for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. Once successfully launched, this supply network will serve a shared platform to save lives and form intervention planning and communicate critical information, plus disseminate lessons learned, so that the world's response to pandemic continuously improves. Henry Schein believes in public-private partnerships as a core value and a key part of our success. 
So with that overview of our quarterly and full year financials and operating performance, with a huge thanks to Team Schein, our suppliers and our customers and, of course, our investors who we are committed to providing a reliable, continuous stream of income, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. 
And now, operator, we're ready to take questions."

First off, you talked about some basic equipment strength in the quarter. Wondering if you could maybe give a little more color on what you're seeing in a couple of areas. I'd point to DSOs, maybe the pace of business you're seeing there versus private practice. And maybe, if you could talk about any benefits you might be seeing from one of your new basic equipment relationships. Is that opening up new business? Is that just replacing other branded sales you might have been making? And then, just on the technology side of equipment, any commentary there as you pointed more to basic equipment than I think you did technology?"

So yes, our traditional business has -- did very well. But let me hasten to point out that in January 2015, we did announce taking on the A-dec line, which we actually brought in around May. We did, I think, do well on the A-dec line. I believe we did live up to the expectations and perhaps even exceeded what was expected from us by A-dec. But let me hasten to say that we did well with our traditional suppliers that have supported us for decades, and in that context, overall we did well with the traditional equipment. Obviously, adding the A-dec line put stress on our organization from -- equipment organization and our field sales consultants from a learning point of view and from a service point of view, learning how to service the equipment and fine-tuning our design capabilities. All of that was well absorbed while maintaining the relationship with our branded manufacturers that have supported us for all these years. So I would say, overall, the manufacturers are pleased, and our sales organization is pleased, and now I am, of course, dealing with the United States and Canada. On the digital side and the high-tech side, I believe we made pretty good progress as well. We currently believe we're selling more than 1 of 3 new units in the CAD/CAM space, which is our #1 global strategy to advance digitalized prosthetics. We are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan offerings. Of course, I think you know Henry Schein is committed to open architecture to the extent suppliers provide us with the products. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression solutions and provides dentists with innovative -- what we believe, innovative, robust and efficient choices for a scholar [ph] of dentistry. In addition, we continue to be well-positioned, we believe, and have made huge progress in the lab. So when you look at equipment, it's not only the equipment that is sold to the dentist but to the lab as well, and it's in the digital restorations that we outsource to -- that provide solutions for the digital restorations that are outsourced to lab facilities that we also feel we are doing very well. So it's the entire spectrum of traditional equipment, including digital imaging, 3D, et cetera, sensors and, of course, the digital prosthetics that I think we have done very well, and we believe, overall, we have gained market share, balancing those suppliers that work with us over the years with A-dec. And I believe, we've satisfied our obligation and more than satisfied our obligation across the board. We are particularly pleased with the level of integration between our Practice Solutions businesses, both at Dentrix and at Exan, which is the schools business. So overall, I think we are very pleased with the direction of our equipment business in the United States. You ask specifically about the large accounts. Yes, the top 50 accounts in the United States and our Special Markets group are very important to us, and we continue to do well in those -- in that space. Of course, there is competition. You know about it. Everybody's focused on this, but I believe we have very good solutions for these accounts. In addition, our mid-market group, which became quite active in the second half of the year, that's the group that is multiple locations -- that has multiple locations under common management and generally owned by a dentist versus the very large practices that are generally owned by a financial sponsor or -- yes, there're no public companies, so financial sponsor. So we have covering both sides of the markets as well as the -- so they're very big, the midsize and, of course, the dental schools and other institutions. I believe that continues to do well for Henry Schein. And then internationally, we did well. We were actually very pleased with the fourth quarter in that the halo effect of the IDS continued into the fourth quarter, and we believe actually has spilt over into the first quarter. So overall, our equipment business throughout the world is doing quite well. I could go on and on and on, but I think that's probably enough."

So when you look at CAD/CAM, we're continuing to see good growth there. It was a little bit less overall than the 11.5% in North America, but the dynamic that we're seeing is really very strong growth on scanner only. We're still seeing full unit sales in addition to that, but there's been a little bit of a change in the market over the last year or 2, where customers are beginning to look at scan-onlys to start with, and then hopefully in the future, they'll add the milling machine. So that's been a nice opportunity for us. And the only other point I wanted to just to add is A-dec has helped the traditional equipment growth obviously. But the good news is that -- and Stanley said this I believe, is that we haven't seen it cannibalize other equipment lines. So we really do think that we're penetrating new customers with the A-dec product line for the most part, and that's also good news. That's not just swapping out other equipment lines."

Let me just give you a context and while I'm doing that, Steven can think through the specific numbers. But there are 2 component parts to this market. The first is specialty products per se, that are only used by specialists and used by those GPs that are doing specialty procedures. We're not talking about our oral surgery products, implants, bone regeneration, a few other specialty products. In the endodontic space, the endo-specific files related kinds of products and in the orthodontic space, the wires specifically and the brackets, and of course, the liners, which we don't really sell. But then, in addition to that, there are products that specialists purchase such as equipment and consumables and gloves and oral surgeons buy pharmaceutical products, et cetera, that we've always sold as part of our general core business. And I would say that business always tends to do a little bit better with expense of equipment, like the 3D x-ray, et cetera, because specialists, firstly, need these products, and secondly, they tend to make more money so they can afford more specialty products. When we talk about our specialty business, we are referring to not that product, the general products, which are part of our core business and nor are we referring to the software in particular, that's part of our software business, but we referring to the specialty products like implants, bone regeneration, wires and brackets and files, et cetera in the endo space. And in that space, it's hard for us to measure how the market is growing because no one compares what we -- compares, there's no like information.

I'll just -- I'll turn it over to Stanley on the production animal, but as you know, in North America, we are predominantly companion, maybe a few percentage of our revenues are production.

Thank you, Steven.

So we have capabilities of connecting software to various devices, and scil, just our various businesses in Dental and Medical, provides that capability. So -- and we're very pleased with that team really on these. And now you ask about large animal. Nothing's never, but we don't think distributing branded pharmaceuticals in mass on a logistics basis for large animals is really the best use of our capital. It's not too different to us years ago exiting the specialty pharma space, where there's huge amounts of sales available that are relatively large margin; better for the drug wholesalers to do that than for us. So in the large animal space, we will continue to look for market opportunities. Some countries present an opportunity. For example, in the dairy industry, we're quite active in Ireland and parts of Europe and in particular, New Zealand. So there's an opportunity. The equine area, which is not really -- I suppose it would be large animals, but it's not really production animals, is an area we're very interested in and believe we can bring value. And then there are markets like Australia, New Zealand and pieces of Europe, where we believe that through our logistics, we add value that others don't add. So -- and then there will be unique products for the large animal that, for example, KRUUSE has, scil has, veterinary instruments, orthodontic -- orthopedic business provides. So we will be more selective to find areas that we could bring value, and this creates high-margin opportunity rather than shipping of masses amounts of low-margin branded pharmaceuticals."

My quick question really just had to do with the North American Dental equipment in the fourth quarter. Obviously, pretty strong, but there still just seems to be some investor confusion or mixed views really as to whether or not the timing of renewal of that 179 tax deduction helps overall dental industry equipment sales or not. And also, I think whether for you guys or for the industry just thinking ahead to -- for 2016, the upcoming 4Q '16 given that the start had been renewed, I think, for a couple of years, how do we think about that year-over-year comp for North American Dental equipment 4Q '16 versus 4Q '15 just in terms of whether it's a normalized comparison, just any thoughts on that as well?"

Our sales organization had given up being able to really cultivate relationship space for equipment -- specific equipment using 179, and you needed really complete plug and play. So for example, CAD/CAM couldn't work and big traditional equipment couldn't work; maybe a few x-rays could work here and there. But it had very little impact for 2015. Assuming that Congress keeps it in place this year, I think it'll be a very good opportunity for the end of 2016. Steven, any more information?"

So unless Congress decides to repeal it during 2016, it should be available in fourth quarter 2016 and ongoing, and the benefit is the first $500,000 of equipment that qualified small businesses buy can be expensed in the year that they buy it.

Looking at the bottom line, double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS represents a solid start to the year. We also are pleased to affirm guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share, which represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the adjusted 2015 results.

I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pretax or $0.04 per d",1474,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pretax or $0.04 per diluted share. Also, our Q1 2015 results include restructuring cost of $6.9 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the second quarter of 2016.  I will be discussing our reports -- our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which is excluding those restructuring costs in both periods as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes.  Exhibit B to this morning's news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations.
Turning to our results, net sales for the quarter ended March 26, 2016, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 10.1% increase compared with the first quarter of 2015. This consisted of 12.0% growth in local currencies and a 1.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 9.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.7%. I think it's important to know that when you normalize our sales or switches between agency sales and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for Q1 was 6.1%. Again, you can note the details of sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of earnings news release that was issued this morning.
Operating margin as reported for the first quarter of 2016 was 6.5% and contracted by 6 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2015. However, when excluding restructuring costs, acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and also excluding the impact of switching between agency and direct sales, our adjusted operating margin expanded by 23 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%. And on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring costs, it was slightly less at 30.4%. This compares with 30.8% in the first quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. We expect our effective tax rates on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $116.8 million or $1.41 per diluted share. That represents increases of 7.7% and 10.2%, respectively, compared with the first quarter. As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against that translation exposure. And although foreign exchange impact was less than the prior year, it was still approximately $0.02 dilutive to our EPS in the current quarter.
I'll now provide some detail in our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the first quarter of 2016 increased 4.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 6.1% growth in local currencies and a 2.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.2%. The North American internal growth in local currencies was 6.4% and included 4.6% growth from sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 13.5% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to large group practices, dental service organizations and community health centers. Our growth in equipment sales and service revenue reflected particular strength in high-tech equipment.
The international internal growth in local currencies was 2.3%. That included 1.6% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 4.3% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales internationally was led by France, Australia and Spain. And growth in equipment sales and service revenue was led by Germany, France and Australia. 
Our Animal Health sales was $771.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12.7%. This included growth of 15.6% in local currencies and a 2.9% decline related to foreign currencies. Internal sales in local currencies grew by 9.8% while acquisitions contributed 5.8% to growth. The North American growth in internal sales and in local currencies was 16.7%. However, it's important to note that, that reflects a 7.4% growth when we normalize results to again account for the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales.  We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance our North American health business and also reflects the strength of the broader animal health market. Our International Animal Health internal growth in local currencies was 3.1%.
Turning to medical, our medical sales were $538.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 21.3%. This consisted of 21.5% growth in local currencies and a small 0.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. The 21.5% growth in local currencies breaks out between 22.3% growth in North America and 2% growth internationally. Both of those numbers are internally generated. When normalizing for the impact of agency sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 11.2%, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains.  We believe we have been outperforming the medical market by a significant margin for the past 5 quarters as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices. 
Technology and value-added service sales were $101.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 18.6%. This included 19.9% growth in local currencies and a 1.3% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 7.5% and acquisition growth was 12.4%.  The 7.5% internal growth in local currencies consisted of 8.0% growth in North America and 5.1% growth internationally. I think it's important also to note that through product upgrades, enhancements and strategic acquisitions, the advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for real improvement and efficiency in delivering of health care services. there are also new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups.
I'll talk about stock repurchase. During the quarter we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 664,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $150.51 per share, and that's approximately $100 million of cash flow. And the impact on this repurchase in the fourth -- in the first quarter to our EPS was less than $0.01 of accretion. At the close of the quarter, we still had approximately $300 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. And we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value.
I'll take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $101.5 million. That compares to negative $26.7 million in Q1 last year, but I think most people realize that first quarter cash flow for us is typically negative due to seasonality and working capital during the quarter. We continue to believe that on a full year basis, we will have strong operating cash flow for the year.
Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 42.1 days, which compares to 41.2 days last year. Inventory turns was 5.1 turns this quarter and compares to 5.3 turns last year.
I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. For 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of last year of $5.96. Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which are expected to be the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per diluted share.  Also, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates will continue to be generally consistent with current levels. 
Last, I'd like to remind you that we report our results on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So for fiscal 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], we will have 53 weeks. The extra week for us is in Q4 2016. But since that 53rd week is a holiday week at the end of the year and sales are usually lower than a typical week, the extra week does not materially add to our earnings since fixed expenses remain relatively constant with that slow sales week.
So with that financial review, I'll turn it back to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our first business groups with Dental. We are quite pleased to report Global Dental internal sales growth in local currency of nearly 5%, with particular strength in equipment which speaks to the overall health of the broader dental market. From a strategic perspective, establishing Henry Schein in Japan has been a long-standing corporate goal. Japan after all is the world's second-largest dental market. And through two important investment positions, we are now well on our way in that important market. 
You may have of course recall that we established a presence in Japan in October 2014 with an investment at USA dental supply. Late in the first quarter, we expanded our Japanese presence by partnering with J. Morita. We have known J. Morita for many years. They are one of the world's largest manufacturers and distributors of dental equipment supplies, and we hold the company in high regard.  More specifically, we acquired a 50% interest in their One Piece [ph] subsidiary. One Piece is composed of 8 dental dealers located across Japan. They serve approximately 6,000 dental clinics, and they had sales in fiscal 2015 of approximately USD 125 million. We look forward to other Japanese dealers joining our partnership in the near future. Japan has about 90,000 dentists and about 64,000 dental clinics. And with the addition of One Piece, we now serve approximately 20% of the market. 
Also, during the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, [ph] a Brazilian distributor of dental supplies and equipment. Brazil holds good potential for our Dental group as well, and this investment builds upon our existing business there, which we established in 2014 as well. I discussed Dental Cremer in our last quarter call, and we look forward to closing this transaction later this year.
Regarding our digital dental efforts, we are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3 Shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression scanning solutions here in North America. And given our desire to promote and open architecture and provide dentists with innovative, robust and efficient choices for dentistry, we believe we have an excellent offering. Of course, in Europe, we do so and we believe are the most significant distributor of the Sirona solution for CAD/CAM. In addition, we continue to be well positioned in the lab market on a global basis, providing solutions for digital restorations that are outsourced for the lab facilities.
Last week, Aligned Technology and 3 Shape [ph] announced that several of 3 Shape's digital scanners will be compatible for use with case submissions later this year. The 2 companies also announced an agreement to enhance digital workflow between scanners and laboratory partners using 3 Shape dental software. Like Henry Schein, this announcement makes clear that Aligned supports an open systems approach to digital impression, and we are pleased to be advancing along the same lines. 
Several months ago, we attended the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting, which is an important trade show for our company, among our many activities at this year's event. We introduced milling block system. This system is compatible with the Glide 150 mil, which will now enable practitioners to offer patients high strength, authentic zirconia restorations in one visit. This system furthers our commitment to expanding CAD/CAM product categories here in North America and of course, throughout the world and to the future of digital dentistry on a global basis.
We're very excited with the progress we're making on all fronts in our dental business in core consumable business, the equipment business, the implant business, the other specialty areas and of course in our CAD/CAM solution in the dental office chairside and of course through our digital highway into the lab and our presence within the laboratory space both in North America and abroad, in Australia or New Zealand, Europe, et cetera, and I might have had even more in Asia.
Let me now touch briefly at our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results, internal sales growth in local currency here in North America was 7.4%. We're making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio. These products are typically sold under multiyear lease. And as those agreements come to an end, we're looking forward to adding even more diagnostic customers to our base. Many of our customers have multiyear agreements in place. And I think that our team is very confident that our offering will be appropriate for the dental marketplace, the animal health marketplace here in North America and in Europe and Australia and New Zealand. The diagnostic offering we have will be well positioned to assume many of those leases as they mature. We are also targeting large practices that may be seeking to purchase additional diagnostic instruments to handle their higher volume patient testing needs, whether it is machinery or the quick test disposable. 
Earlier in the quarter at the North American veterinary conference in Orlando, we announced that Axis-Q command center software was available in the U.S. for Abaxis systems. This software links our Practice Management software with diagnostics instruments. We have received quite a positive response, excellent feedback from veterinarians who value the efficient and integrated workflow and revenue capture features offered by Axis-Q.
Our International Animal Health growth in local currencies during the first quarter was more than 13%, which reflects the positive contribution of the number of strategic acquisition we have completed last year, many in Europe. Again, we have are very pleased with the progress we're making across the board, across the globe with our Animal Health team, also just like our dental team, great leadership focused on executing our strategic plan and doing a great job on the ground in each of the countries we're in, but also advancing our strategic product offering that we are driving through our local distribution entity entities throughout the world. Very, very pleased with the management and the progress our Animal Health team are executing on.
Now on the medical side, we reported growth in our medical group is impacted by agency sales in the prior year under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. Yet when normalizing for this, the core internal growth for the North American medical business was a robust 11.2% as of course, Steven mentioned earlier on. We remain highly optimistic about our ability to win new customers in the medical space. We have completed the material components of the Cardinal integration and have experienced positive feedback from the customers that came along with this merger of the 2 physician businesses and the ASC businesses.  We continue to partner with Cardinal on combined proposals to large IDNs and have had a number of wins. Finally, the Cardinal sales organization that came along with this merger on the physician side has been fully integrated, and we continue to see expansion in our market share within the nonacute space.
Let me conclude the review of our businesses with an overview of the technology and value-added services part of the business. We are generally pleased with the first quarter performance of this business group, which includes the highest quarterly growth rate in North America in nearly 2 years with particular strength in software and financial services. Early in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Vetstreet, and a month later, we acquired RxWorks. Both transactions strengthened our position of leadership and add value to our customer base worldwide. This is not just a U.S. strategy on the Animal Health side, but a global strategy. And we believe we have by far the largest installed base of animal health practice management systems, both in this country and on a global basis, being in a position to provide huge support to our customer base and also our manufacturing partners who are seeking the information that we can provide as a result of this installed base, in other words, the data and the alignment with our sales organizations as we execute on aligned interest with our manufacturing partners.
As I discussed during the last quarterly call -- quarter call, Vetstreet is a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. We are particularly excited about the potential to pair our practice management software solutions with the Vetstreet data analytics capability, really, really exciting. There's no one else in our industry, we believe, that has this capability to support not only information that will help the practitioners improve the operations and profitability and care they provide in their practices as well as support the needs of our manufacturers, specifically on the pharmaceutical side who are seeking to get their products to the market. 
RxWorks is a practice management software company, serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks' installed base of more than 1,500 clinics strengthens our growing practice management software business and complements our expanding Animal Health technology platform.
A moment ago, I mentioned the Chicago midwinter conference, and another one of our launches there was Dexis for Dentrix Ascend. This cloud-based imaging solution was built exclusively for Dentrix Ascend and helps to quickly capture and store images. Doing so eliminates the need for additional digital imaging software and automates daily procedures such as insurance billing. This software is initially available to users in North America and exemplifies our commitment to provide digital solutions that improve workflow and allow for better clinical care. 
So much of the Henry Schein's future and -- is directly tied to our digital solutions that will help, of course, not only in the dental space, but we have imaging and prosthetic solutions that we are offering, and we'll expand that offering in the near future and over in the years to come in an exciting way. But the same kind of dynamics, interoperability exists as a huge opportunity in our animal health space and in our medical space.  So let me comment on some recent announcements of 2 new corporate positions that we have established at Henry Schein, aimed at advancing our commercial capabilities and of course driving growth opportunities.
Dave McKinley, the president of our Henry Schein Medical group, has been promoted to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer for Henry Schein corporate. Specifically, Dave will be responsible for the following 4 areas: global corporate marketing, working across the business to leverage Henry Schein's brand. We have a great brand in 4 of our different business areas, and we'd like to capitalize on that to advance the overall brand of Henry Schein as a company focused on solutions to the office space practitioner in the dental, medical and animal health space. There are huge opportunities we believe to advance global product category management for the company as a whole across the platform. And then there are the technology initiatives, including customer solutions, e-commerce and business intelligence that we have in many, many parts of our business that we feel we can optimize and drive these technologies on a common platform throughout the Henry Schein organization. And then Dave will take responsibility for certain specialty businesses.  Over the last decade plus Dave has been with Henry Schein he has made a significant contribution to the company's success, starting with his initial responsibilities for leading our prosthetic business over a decade ago, including initial -- developing the initial business development plan for 340 CAD/CAM products and Camlog. Both of these products in the end or actually today are doing quite well for Henry Schein, and Dave led the initial development of the business plan and the early execution of those business plans. He also laid the foundation for what is a currently highly effective dental practice solutions management team on the dental side in Utah. So Dave has been at the forefront of driving change, effective change, at Henry Schein and making a real difference in our strategic platform.  So we thank Dave for the terrific work he's done to date in the prosthetics field, in the practice solutions field, and of course most recently in the last 7 years or so, in developing initially with Mike Racioppi and then with the senior risk management team, our medical strategies, particularly our Healthcare Services group which is the group that services large practices and then effectively executing on those plans, showing the tremendous results that we've experienced in the Medical group over the last years.
Karen , Senior Vice President at Boston Scientific Corporation, will join Henry Schein a s the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of our global animal health, medical and dental surgical group. This is a new group we've established at Henry Schein. Karen will also be a member of our executive management team, by the way as Dave will continue. 
The senior management team who will support Karen's group are in the animal health area. Peter McCarthy, who will continue to serve as the president of our Global Animal Health group, Peter, who joined Henry Schein about 6 years ago from a large pharma company, really created what is today a very, very successful international business for Henry Schein in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and assumed overall leadership of our Animal Health group in the middle of 2015 -- has been a really major contributor to advancing our global animal health platform results, strategy to develop those results that result in these terrific results. Peter and his team are doing excellent work in our growing Animal Health business which is showing, of course, excellent results. And pursuing -- Peter and the team are pursuing many of the new and exciting opportunities, both to expand our global presence and our unique product offering in the Animal Health space.
Brad , also a Henry Schein veteran, 20-plus years, has been promoted to president of the commercial group in the United States medical business. And Jeff Waldman, Chief Administrative Officer -- Chief Administrative Operations Officer for our U.S. medical group will take an additional functional responsibility for sales operations and finance. Brad has done a remarkable job in leading our sales and positioning in the medical markets, a highly regarded executive in the medical space. And Jeff, also an executive over a decade, has been very, very -- has contributed in a very, very nice way in many parts of Henry Schein on the financial and the operational side. Both of these promotions are reflective of Brad and Jeff's success in helping to drive growth in the Henry Schein Medical business.
Rene [ph] will continue to serve as president of our rapidly growing Global Dental surgical group. Rene, also seasoned implant oral surgery executive; along with Steve Bogan, President and CEO of the highly successful BioHorizons implant business, one of the fastest-growing implant businesses in the world; and Michael Ludwick, general manager of our CAMLOG German business, we are -- and Michael has done a remarkable job in establishing the very important position of CAMLOG in Germany. And in their teams have done work in leading our implant business and positioning us -- Henry Schein as one of the world's leading implant companies.
So Karen has the background in health care, extensive experience in managing large matrix organizations, will be joining us in the middle of the May. Throughout Karen's career, she has demonstrated an ability to bring people together, manage change and grow businesses, a 17-year veteran of J&J and most recently for the last 4 years or so at Boston Scientific.
So we have created these new positions at a time when market, technology and demographic forces are converging in one of the most unique ways, at least in my 35-plus years at Henry Schein, to create unique business opportunities for the company. We believe Dave and Karen's leadership will help us to capitalize on the significant opportunities before us. We are particularly pleased with a deep bench o f management we have in each of the 3 business units that we discussed, the Animal Health area, the medical area and, of course, the oral surgery area implant area and related products.
I would also like to comment on some upcoming changes that we anticipate for the Henry Schein's Board of Directors that are noted in our current proxy statement and to be voted on at our March -- at our May, sorry, 31st annual meeting of stockholders. We have proposed the addition of 2 new directors to take the seats of 2 long-serving directors, who will be retiring from our board. The retiring directors, Norman Matthews and Dr. Lou Sullivan, both helped guide Henry Schein through a period of unprecedented growth and change. Norman has been a director since 2002, an experienced professional director who has enormous credibility in the marketplace and contributed in a significant way to Henry Schein's growth for almost 14 years. Dr. Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health, similar track record. Dr. Sullivan joined us, our board, in 2003. Both Norman and Dr. Sullivan have been a part of Henry Schein's successful journey over the past decade from a time when the company served only dental and medical company -- customers. I think our sales in the 2002, '03 time frame was something like 2.8 billion. At the close of 2015, our net sales were up nearly fourfold to 10.6 billion. And of course, we now serve Animal Health practitioners on a worldwide basis. In fact, Animal Health sales in 2015 were more than our company's entire sales at the time Norman Matthews joined our board.
I could go on at length about the contributions and character of both Norman Matthews and Dr. Sullivan. But instead on behalf of my colleagues at Henry Schein, my fellow directors and of course, our shareholders, we simply say thank you for your contribution. You have both contributed in a significant way to creating significant shareholder value for the Henry Schein shareholders. 
We are fortunate to have 2 new director nominees on the proxy who will bring excellent and complete, complementary skills to our board. The first is Joseph Haring, whose career in health care spans more than 35 years. He served as CEO of [indiscernible] for more than a decade, up through the acquisition by LabCore [ph] about a year ago. Earlier in his career, Joseph held very senior leadership positions with Caremark International and American Hospital Supply. Upon his election to the Henry Schein board, Joe will bring to Henry Schein comprehensive knowledge on pharmaceutical management sales and of course, guiding fast-growing -- experience in growing fast-growth companies.
Kurt is our second nominee. Kurt spent his entire correctly nested United Postal Service and served as the UPS CFO for 8 years through his retirement last year. At UPS, Kurt also had leadership roles in sales and marketing engineering operations and strategic cost planning. Clearly Kurt is an expert in distribution logistics as well as corporate finance and accounting and was part of the UPS successful transition from a pure transportation company to a logistics company that has an enormous array of value-added services. We look forward to many -- to the many talents he will bring to Henry Schein. And so welcome, Joe and Kurt, to the proxy, and I trust they will be elected overwhelmingly in May.
So with that commentary and overview of the quarterly financial operating performance, there just isn't time today to go through all of the exciting items that are being dealt with at Henry Schein across the board. The company is making advances and so many and so many exciting ways. So now, operator, we're ready to take some questions."

Generally, I think dentists are feeling good about their practices. I think there is stability in patient visits. And I think dentists are understanding that investing in newer technology provides for better quality dental care, a better experience for the customer and actually results in a more profitable practice and of course, combined with quality of care. So I would say it's driven, to a large extent, by some of the newer technologies in the imaging side, on the prosthetics side. And we have a very good offering today of products that match the needs of the marketplace. We did add the A-dec in North America which is contributing. Having said that, I think our sales across the board, even with the existing portfolio of traditional equipment, has been good. So overall, it's good dynamics in the marketplace in terms of the dentists feeling good, the newer technology available and a little bit, the result of us expanding our offering with the A-dec product line. But it wouldn't put that much emphasis on that. A-dec is doing well with us, but it's also a relatively small part of the entire equipment portfolio, but it is doing well."

And we're seeing strong growth in the scan-onlys,, which for us, we think, is very positive in the initial sale, but also positions the customer to come back to us in the future when they're looking to do chairside . and they can then buy the additional components from us at a later date. So CAD/CAM, the total category of complete systems and scan-onlys was very strong for us. But truly was across the board because traditional equipment as well as high tech was both strong."

So the majority of Cardinal's physician care customers have transitioned to our platform. And we are working together on a number of IDN sales opportunities, actually generated some very nice sales together. The particular situation, or the particular opportunity with Kaiser that Cardinal has -- the business that they have won is less in our wheelhouse than the business we undertake day to day. I believe that it is more of a bulk distribution arrangement, and Cardinal is handling that from their distribution system. So that is not exactly the kind of business we anticipated working on together, but there are many, many IDNs that we are working on together, and actually have landed quite a bit of business in that regard."

So that's what's drives it. But a full year basis, we're looking at growing our operating cash flow probably consistent with our bottom line growth rate, our net income growth year-over-year. So we still believe we can generate strong cash flow on a full year basis with some growth similar to our bottom line growth. We did also have, during the quarter, a little bit of duplicative inventory in consolidating some warehouses in Europe, specifically Germany. Over the balance of the year, that inventory level will come down. We did that as a precautionary measure as we're moving and consolidating distribution centers in Germany. We typically have inventory, excess inventory that we manage through over the next few months. So again, we still feel that operating cash flow will continue to be strong and grow over the prior year."

We would like for that to continue. I don't think acceleration there is something that we can expect, but we do expect that for the foreseeable future, that we can continue to put up high single to low double-digit sales growth. I think we're pleased to that across all of our businesses and all of our markets, we think patient traffic has been healthy. U.S. dental patient traffic has been healthy as well as even in the European markets, although not in every market. But as we said in the prepared comments, even markets like Spain that over the last year or 2 had some challenges in market growth, was a strong grower for us. So I think we feel like the overall markets are continuing to cooperate. We do believe that there is the potential for some very modest continued gradual improvement in underlying market conditions, but we're happy with the overall 6%-plus constant currency growth that we achieved as a company."

And so the pipeline is as full as ever. Of course, there's no guarantee as to when we can close the deal. Deals with us often take many years from the time we start talking to people to the time we close. And there's not much that's related to the financial markets per se. So we remain quite optimistic that we'll continue with our internal growth and supplement the growth with acquisitions. We have committed that we will use our cash flow in 3 ways. One is to buy shares. One is to invest in the business, although investing in the business sometimes is not as important from a cash flow point of view because we're a net generator of cash, but we nevertheless do invest in the business some of the cash flow. But it's essentially from the buying of stock and the investment in acquisitions, and we continue to expect that trend to continue, as it has for years now."

Our Animal Health strategy encompasses 2 major focus. One is to advance geographic presence throughout the world. Wherever there's a middle-class that is interested in pets, we'd like to be there, and selectively in the production side, but very, very selectively. And it's not necessarily with the largest markets are, but they are opportunities. So for example, we do a good job in Derry in Ireland and New Zealand. And there's those kinds of opportunities, plus some opportunities in equine. So we want to get a large geographic footprint. And then we want to focus on a couple of things. First is pharma farmer market share around the world. And in that connection, we work with large pharma companies, but also some companies. Two is we want to find unique products to put through these channels. And in that connection, there opportunities in the area such as instruments where we acquired a company, Veterinary Instruments, several years ago and they're taking products around the world and doing quite well with that. The second is in the area of med-surg products. We acquired KRUUSE out of Scandinavia. They do business in about 100 countries. And we are advancing their product offering and their market share throughout the world and particularly through the Henry Schein channels. And then the third is equipment, and in that area, we included diagnostics. Equipment include, of course, imaging equipment, surgical equipment and the diagnostics. Under that category is also some disposable diagnostics. And diagnostics in particular tie into the third area which is the area of software and interconnected -- and the connectivity between software and devices and big data. We've been investing in all of those areas, not only in actual software providers such as MidRx and other companies we acquired over the last 4 or 5 years. And today, we have the largest installed base of practice management software in a number of countries, including the U.S. where over half of veterinarians are using our software. So it's the installation software and data. And in that connection, we invested in Vetstreet last quarter, and we have a number of other opportunities to capitalize on data. So that's the broad strategy. Now to address diagnostics specifically, diagnostics is not necessarily about the machine per se. It's about the interoperability connection between the practice management software and diagnostics. We have invested in Axis-Q which is -- we are -- I think we launched it in January a year ago. Axis-Q is doing quite well in terms of market acceptance. And we expect more connectivity between Axis-Q to their reference lab and of course, the diagnostic machinery. Bottom line is, if you're asking about how we're doing specifically in North America, which is where you refer to a particular company not wishing to do business with us anymore, we actually had a very good first quarter, not only in the products we represent, the Abaxis and the product, but also with the skill product offering, the company we acquired in Europe that has a line of connectivity products and its own products. So we're doing quite well in the diagnostic space in North America and by the way, in Europe as well. So it's a broad strategy of geographic penetration and product penetration in terms of pharmaceuticals, the specialized areas we've acquired our presence in, and the technology area."

So we've got 3, and we are likely to add more scanning products over time. I think all of these will be connected in one way or another to all of the major applications. Perhaps there'll be one big company that is not so open to open architecture, we don't know, but we are very much pro-open architecture, have always been at Henry Schein. We are delighted to carry any product that any quality manufacturer has, whether it's consumables, equipment in high tech and have always been pro-competition and open to open architecture.

So we are comfortable with our offering for the dentist and for the dental laboratory. We think we're making good progress in this country and abroad.

Similarly, on the Animal Health side, we would see the growth that we experienced which was 7-and-change percent. We'd like to see that continue. There might be a little opportunity for acceleration there, and the agency shift will probably continue for the next few quarters. With respect to operating margin, the goal is still to get operating margin expansion for the full year, and we typically don't see much of it in Q1 for a number of reasons. But again, stripping out some of those unusual items, we did get 23 basis points of margin expansion in Q1, but we expect to get further operating margin expansion for the full year.

Looking at the bottom line, double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS represents a solid start to the year. We also are pleased to affirm guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share, which represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the adjusted 2015 results. We have made good progress across the board in all of our businesses in advancing our strategic plan. The morale in the company is great. The management team, I think, is well positioned and focused.

I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pretax or $0.04 per d",1473,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pretax or $0.04 per diluted share. Also, our Q1 2015 results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the second quarter of 2016.  I will be discussing our reports -- our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which is excluding those restructuring costs in both periods, as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes.  Exhibit B to this morning's news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations.
Turning to our results, net sales for the quarter ended March 26, 2016, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 10.1% increase compared with the first quarter of 2015. This consisted of 12.0% growth in local currencies and a 1.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 9.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.7%. I think it's important to note that when you normalize our sales for switches between agency sales and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for Q1 was 6.1%. Again, you can note the details of sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning.
Operating margin, as reported for the first quarter of 2016, was 6.5% and contracted by 6 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2015. However, when excluding restructuring costs, acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and also excluding the impact of switching between agency and direct sales, our adjusted operating margin expanded by 23 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%. And on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring costs, it was slightly less at 30.4%. This compares with 30.8% in the first quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. We expect our effective tax rates on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $116.8 million or $1.41 per diluted share. That represents increases of 7.7% and 10.2%, respectively, compared with the first quarter. As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against that translation exposure. And although foreign exchange impact was less than the prior year, it was still approximately $0.02 dilutive to our EPS in the current quarter.
I'll now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the first quarter of 2016 increased 4.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 6.1% growth in local currencies and a 2.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.2%. The North American internal growth in local currencies was 6.4% and included 4.6% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 13.5% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to large group practices, dental service organizations and community health centers. Our growth in equipment sales and service revenue reflected particular strength in high-tech equipment.
The international internal growth in local currencies was 2.3%. That included 1.6% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 4.3% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales internationally was led by France, Australia and Spain. And growth in equipment sales and service revenue was led by Germany, France and Australia. 
Our Animal Health sales was $771.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12.7%. This included growth of 15.6% in local currencies and a 2.9% decline related to foreign currencies. Internal sales in local currencies grew by 9.8%, while acquisitions contributed 5.8% to growth. The North American growth in internal sales in local currencies was 16.7%. However, it's important to note that, that reflects a 7.4% growth when we normalize results to again account for the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales.  We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American health business and also reflects the strength of the broader animal health market. Our International Animal Health internal growth in local currencies was 3.1%.
Turning to medical, our medical sales were $538.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 21.3%. This consisted of 21.5% growth in local currencies and a small 0.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. The 21.5% growth in local currencies breaks out between 22.3% growth in North America and 2% growth internationally. Both of those numbers are internally generated. When normalizing for the impact of agency sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 11.2%, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains.  We believe we have been outperforming the medical market by a significant margin for the past 5 quarters, as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards larger group practices. 
Technology and value-added service sales were $101.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 18.6%. This included 19.9% growth in local currencies and a 1.3% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 7.5% and acquisition growth was 12.4%.  The 7.5% internal growth in local currencies consisted of 8.0% growth in North America and 5.1% growth internationally. I think it's important to also note that through product upgrades, enhancements and strategic acquisitions, the advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for real improvement and efficiency in delivering of health care services. There are also new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups.
I'll talk about stock repurchase. During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 664,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $150.51 per share, and that's approximately $100 million of cash flow. The impact on this repurchase in the fourth -- in the first quarter to our EPS was less than $0.01 of accretion. At the close of the quarter, we still had approximately $300 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. And we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value.
I'll take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $101.5 million. That compares to negative $26.7 million in Q1 last year, but I think most people realize that first quarter cash flow for us is typically negative due to seasonality and working capital during the quarter. We continue to believe that on a full year basis, we will have strong operating cash flow for the year.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding was 42.1 days, which compares to 41.2 days last year. Inventory turns was 5.1 turns this quarter and compares to 5.3 turns last year.
I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. For 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS last year of $5.96. Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which were expected to be the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per diluted share.  Also, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates will continue to be generally consistent with current levels. 
Last, I'd like to remind you that we report our results on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So for fiscal 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], we will have 53 weeks. The extra week for us is in Q4 2016. But since that 53rd week is a holiday week at the end of the year and sales are usually lower than a typical week, the extra week does not materially add to our earnings, since fixed expenses remain relatively constant with that slow sales week.
So with that financial review, I'll turn it back to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our first business groups with Dental. We are quite pleased to report Global Dental internal sales growth in local currency of nearly 5%, with particular strength in equipment, which speaks to the overall health of the broader dental market. From a strategic perspective, establishing Henry Schein in Japan has been a long-standing corporate goal. Japan after all is the world's second-largest dental market. And through two important investment positions, we are now well on our way in that important market. 
You may, of course, recall that we established a presence in Japan in October 2014 with an investment in USA dental supply. Late in the first quarter, we expanded our Japanese presence by partnering with J. Morita. We have known J. Morita for many years. They are one of the world's largest manufacturers and distributors of dental equipment and supplies, and we hold the company in high regard.  More specifically, we acquired a 50% interest in their One Piece subsidiary. One Piece is composed of 8 dental dealers located across Japan. They serve approximately 6,000 dental clinics, and they had sales in fiscal 2015 of approximately USD 125 million. We look forward to other Japanese dealers joining our partnership in the near future. Japan has about 90,000 dentists and about 64,000 dental clinics. And with the addition of One Piece, we now serve approximately 20% of the market. 
Also, during the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a Brazilian distributor of dental supplies and equipment. Brazil holds good potential for our Dental Group as well, and this investment builds upon our existing business there, which we established in 2014 as well. I discussed Dental Cremer during our last quarter call, and we look forward to closing this transaction later this year.
Regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression scanning solutions here in North America. And given our desire to promote an open architecture and provide dentists with innovative, robust and efficient choices for restorative dentistry, believe we have an excellent offering. Of course, in Europe, we do so and we believe are the most significant distributor of the CEREC Sirona solution for CAD/CAM. In addition, we continue to be well positioned in the lab market on a global basis, providing solutions for digital restorations that are outsourced for the lab facilities.
Last week, Align Technology and 3shape announced that several of 3shape's digital scanners will be compatible for use with Invisalign case submissions later this year. The 2 companies also announced an agreement to enhance digital workflow between iTero scanners and laboratory partners using 3shape dental software. Like Henry Schein, this announcement makes clear that Align supports an open systems approach to digital impressions, and we are pleased to be advancing along the same lines. 
Several months ago, we attended the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting, which is an important trade show for our company. Among our many activities at this year's events, we introduced BruxZir NOW milling blocks system. This system is compatible with the Glidewell TS150 mil, which will now enable practitioners to offer patients high-strength, authentic zirconia restorations in one visit. This system furthers our commitment to our expanding CAD/CAM product category here in North America and of course, throughout the world and to the future of digital dentistry on a global basis.
We're very excited with the progress we're making on all fronts in our dental business in the core consumable business, the equipment business, the implant business, the other specialty areas and of course, in our CAD/CAM solutions in the dental office chairside and of course, through our digital highway into the lab and our presence within the laboratory space, both in North America and abroad, in Australia or New Zealand, Europe, et cetera, and I might add, even now in Asia.
Let me now touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currency here in North America was 7.4%. We're making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio. These products are typically sold under multiyear lease. And as those agreements come to an end, we're looking forward to adding even more diagnostic customers to our base. Many of our customers have multiyear agreements in place. And I think that and our team is very confident that our offering will be appropriate for the dental marketplace, the animal health marketplace here in North America and in Europe and Australia and New Zealand. The diagnostic offering we have will be well positioned to assume many of those leases as they mature. We are also targeting large practices that may be seeking to purchase additional diagnostic instruments to handle their higher volume patient testing needs, whether it is machinery or the quick test disposable. 
Earlier in the quarter at the North American veterinary conference in Orlando, we announced that Axis-Q command center software was available in the U.S. for Abaxis and Heska systems. This software links our practice management softwaree with diagnostics instruments. We have received quite a positive response, excellent feedback from veterinarians who value the efficient and integrated workflow and revenue capture features offered by Axis-Q.
Our International Animal Health growth in local currencies during the first quarter was more than 13%, which reflects the positive contribution of a number of strategic acquisitions we have completed last year, many in Europe. Again, we are very, very pleased with the progress we're making across the board, across the globe with our Animal Health team, also just like our dental team, great leadership focused on executing our strategic plan and doing a great job on the ground in each of the countries we're in, but also advancing our strategic product offering that we are driving through our local distribution entities throughout the world. Very, very pleased with the management and the progress that our Animal Health team are executing on.
Now on the medical side. The reported growth in our medical group is impacted by agency sales in the prior year under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. Yet when normalizing for this, the core internal growth for the North American Medical business was a robust 11.2% as, of course, Steven mentioned earlier on. We remain highly optimistic about our ability to win new customers in the medical space. We have completed the material components of the Cardinal integration and have experienced positive feedback from the customers that came along with this merger of the the 2 physician businesses and the ASC businesses.  We continue to partner with Cardinal on combined proposals to large IDNs and have had a number of wins. Finally, the Cardinal sales organization that came along with this merger on the physician side has been fully integrated, and we continue to see expansion in our market share within the nonacute space.
Let me conclude the review of our businesses with an overview of the technology and value-added services part of the business. We are generally pleased with the first quarter performance of this business group, which includes the highest quarterly growth rate in North America in nearly 2 years, with particular strength in software and financial services. Early in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Vetstreet, and a month later, we acquired RxWorks. Both transactions strengthened our position of leadership and add value to our customer base worldwide. This is not just a U.S. strategy on the Animal Health side, but a global strategy. And we believe we have by far the largest installed base of animal health practice management systems, both in this country and on a global basis, being in a position to provide huge support to our customer base and also our manufacturing partners, who are seeking the information that we can provide as a result of this installed base, in other words, the data and the alignment with our sales organizations as we execute on aligned interest with our manufacturing partners.
As I discussed during the last quarterly call -- quarter call, Vetstreet is a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. We are particularly excited about the potential to pair our practice management softwaree solutions with the Vetstreet data analytics capability, really, really exciting. There's no one else in our industry, we believe, that has this capability to support not only information that will help the practitioners improve the operations and profitability and care they provide in their practices as well as support the needs of our manufacturers, specifically on the pharmaceutical side who are seeking to get their products to market. 
RxWorks is a practice management software company, serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks' brings an installed base of more than 1,500 clinics, strengthens our growing practice management software business and complements our expanding Animal Health technology platform.
A moment ago, I mentioned the Chicago midwinter conference, and another one of our launches there was DEXIS for Dentrix Ascend. This cloud-based imaging solution was built exclusively for Dentrix Ascend and helps to quickly capture and store images. Doing so eliminates the need for additional digital imaging software and automates daily procedures such as insurance billing. This software is initially available to users in North America and exemplifies our commitment to provide digital solutions that improve workflow and allow for better clinical care.
So much of the Henry Schein's future and -- is directly tied to our digital solutions that will help, of course, not only in the dental space, where we have imaging and prosthetic solutions that we are offering, and we'll expand that offering in the near future and over in the years to come in an exciting way, but the same kind of dynamics, interoperability exists as a huge opportunity in our Animal Health space and in our medical space.  So let me comment on some recent announcements of 2 new corporate positions that we have established at Henry Schein, aimed at advancing our commercial capabilities and of course, driving growth opportunities.
Dave McKinley, the president of our Henry Schein Medical group, has been promoted to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer for Henry Schein corporate. Specifically, Dave will be responsible for the following 4 areas: global corporate marketing, working across the business to leverage Henry Schein's brand. We have a great brand in 4 of our different business areas, and we'd like to capitalize on that to advance the overall brand of Henry Schein as a company focused on solutions to the office space practitioner in the dental, medical and Animal Health space. There are huge opportunities, we believe, to advance global product category management for the company as a whole across the platform. And then there are the technology initiatives, including customer solutions, e-commerce and business intelligence that we have in many, many parts of our business that we feel we can optimize and drive these technologies on a common platform throughout the Henry Schein organization. And then Dave will take responsibility for certain specialty businesses.  Over the last decade plus Dave has been with Henry Schein, he has made a significant contribution to the company's success, starting with his initial responsibilities for leading our prosthetic business over a decade ago, including initial -- developing the initial business plan for E4D, CAD/CAM products and CAMLOG. Both of these products in the end or actually today are doing quite well for Henry Schein, and Dave led the initial development of the business plan and the early execution of those business plans. He also laid the foundation for what is a currently highly effective dental practice solutions management team on the dental side in Utah. So Dave has been at the forefront of driving change, effective change, at Henry Schein and making a real difference in our strategic platform.  So we thank Dave for the terrific work he's done to-date in the prosthetics field, in the practice solutions field, and of course, most recently in the last 7 years or so, in developing initially with Mike Racioppi and then with the senior -- rest of the senior management team, our medical strategies, particularly our Healthcare Services group, which is the group that services the large practices and then effectively executing on those plans, showing the tremendous results that we've experienced with the Medical Group over the last years.
Karen Prange, Senior Vice President at Boston Scientific Corporation, will join Henry Schein as the Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of our Global Animal Health, medical and dental surgical group. This is a new group we've established with Henry Schein. Karen will be -- also be a member of our executive management team, by the way as Dave will continue. 
The senior management team who will support Karen's group are in the animal health area. Peter McCarthy, who will continue to serve as the president of our Global Animal Health group, Peter, who joined Henry Schein about 6 years ago from a large pharma company, really created what is today a very, very successful international business for Henry Schein in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and then assumed an overall leadership of our Animal Health group in the middle of 2015 -- has been a really major contributor to advancing our global animal health platform results, strategy to develop those results that resulted in these terrific results. Peter and his team are doing excellent work in our growing Animal Health business which is showing, of course, excellent results. And pursuing -- Peter and the team are pursuing many of the new and exciting opportunities, both to expand our global presence and our unique product offering in the Animal Health space.
Brad Connett, also a Henry Schein veteran, 20-plus years, has been promoted to President of the commercial group in the United States medical business. And Jeff Waldman, Chief Administrative Officer -- Chief Administrative Operations Officer for our U.S. medical group will take an additional functional responsibility for sales operations and finance. Brad has done a remarkable job in leading our sales and positioning in the medical markets, a highly regarded executive in the medical space. And Jeff, also an executive over a decade, has been very, very -- has contributed in a very, very nice way in many parts of Henry Schein on the financial and the operational side. Both of these promotions are reflective of Brad and Jeff's success in helping to drive growth in the Henry Schein Medical business.
Rene Willi will continue to serve as president of our rapidly growing Global Dental Surgical Group. Rene, also a seasoned implant oral surgery executive; along with Steve Bogan, President and CEO of the highly successful BioHorizons implant business, one of the fastest-growing implant businesses in the world; and Michael Ludwick, general manager of our CAMLOG German business, we are -- and Michael has done a remarkable job in establishing the very important position of CAMLOG in Germany. And their teams have done yeoman's work in leading our implant business and positioning us at Henry Schein as one of the world's leading implant companies.
So Karen has deep background in health care, extensive experience in managing large matrix organizations, will be joining us in the middle of May. Throughout Karen's career, she has demonstrated an ability to bring people together, manage change and grow businesses, a 17-year veteran of J&J and most recently, for the last 4 years or so, at Boston Scientific.
So we have created these new positions at a time when market, technology and demographic forces are converging in one of the most unique ways, and at least in my 35-plus years at Henry Schein, to create unique business opportunities for the company. We believe Dave and Karen's leadership will help us to capitalize on the significant opportunities before us. We are particularly pleased with a deep bench of management we have in each of the 3 business units that we just discussed, the Animal Health area, the medical area and, of course, the oral surgery implant area and related products.
I would also like to comment on some upcoming changes that we anticipate with respect to Henry Schein's Board of Directors that are noted in our current proxy statement and we have voted on at our March -- at our May, sorry, 31st annual meeting of stockholders. We have proposed the addition of 2 new directors to take the seats of 2 long-serving directors, who will be retiring from our board. The retiring directors, Norman Matthews and Dr. Lou Sullivan, both have helped guide Henry Schein through a period of unprecedented growth and change. Norman has been a director since 2002, an experienced professional director who has enormous credibility in the marketplace and contributed in a significant way to Henry Schein's growth for almost 14 years. Dr. Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health, similar track record. Dr. Sullivan joined us, our board, in 2003. Both Norman and Dr. Sullivan have been a part of Henry Schein's successful journey over the past decade from a time when the company served only dental and medical customers. I think our sales in the 2002, '03 time frame was something like $2.8 billion. At the close of 2015, our net sales were up nearly fourfold to $10.6 billion. And of course, we now serve Animal Health practitioners on a worldwide basis. In fact, Animal Health sales in 2015 were more than our company's entire sales at the time Norman Matthews joined our board.
I could go on at length about the contributions and character of both Norman Matthews and Dr. Sullivan. But instead, on behalf of my colleagues at Henry Schein, my fellow directors and of course, our shareholders, we simply say thank you for your contribution. You have both contributed in a significant way to creating significant shareholder value for the Henry Schein shareholders. 
We are fortunate to have 2 new director nominees on the proxy, who will bring excellent and complete, complementary skills to our board. The first is Joseph Herring, whose career in health care spans more than 35 years. He served as CEO of Covance for more than a decade, up through the acquisition by LabCorp about a year ago. Earlier in his career, Joseph held very senior leadership positions with Caremark International and American Hospital Supply. Upon his election to the Henry Schein board, Joe will bring to Henry Schein comprehensive knowledge on pharmaceutical management sales and of course, guiding fast-growing -- experience in growing fast-growth companies.
Kurt Kuehn is our second board nominee. Kurt spent his entire career at United Postal Services and served as the UPS CFO for 8 years through his retirement last year. At UPS, Kurt also had leadership roles in sales and marketing, engineering, operations and strategic cost planning. Clearly, Kurt is an expert in distribution logistics as well as corporate finance and accounting and was part of the UPS' successful transition from a pure transportation company to a logistics company that has enormous array of value-added services. We look forward to many -- to the many talents he will bring to Henry Schein. And so welcome, Joe and Kurt, to the proxy, and trust they will be elected overwhelmingly in May.
So with that commentary and overview of the quarterly financial operating performance, there just isn't the time today to go through all the exciting items that are being dealt with at Henry Schein across the board. The company is making advances on so many fronts in so many exciting ways. So now, operator, we're ready to take some questions."

Generally, I think dentists are feeling good about their practices. I think there is stability in patient visits. And I think dentists are understanding that investing in newer technology provides for better quality dental care, a better experience for the customer and actually results in a more profitable practice, of course, combined with quality of care. So I would say it's driven to a large extent by some of the newer technologies in the imaging side, on the prosthetics side. And we have a very good offering today of products that match the needs of the marketplace. We did add the A-dec line in North America, which is contributing. Having said that, I think our sales across the board, even with the existing portfolio of traditional equipment, has been good. So overall, it's good dynamics in the marketplace in terms of the dentists feeling good, the newer technology available and a little bit, the result of us expanding our offering with the A-dec product line. But I wouldn't put that much emphasis on that. A-dec is doing well with us, but it's also a relatively small part of the entire equipment portfolio, but it is doing well."

And we're seeing strong growth in the scan-onlys, which for us, we think, is very positive in the initial sale, but also positions the customer to come back to us in the future when they're looking to do chairside milling, and they can then buy the additional component from us at a later date. So CAD/CAM, the total category of complete systems and scan-onlys, was very strong for us. But it truly was across the board because traditional equipment as well as high tech was both strong."

So the majority of Cardinal's physician-related ultimate care customers have transitioned to our platform. And we are working together on a number of IDN sales opportunities. We've actually generated some very nice sales together. The particular situation, or the particular opportunity with Kaiser that Cardinal has -- the business they have won is less in our wheelhouse than the business we undertake day to day. I believe that it is more of a bulk distribution arrangement, and Cardinal is handling that from their distribution system. So that is not exactly the kind of business we anticipated working on together, but there are many, many IDNs that we are working on together and actually have landed quite a bit of business in that regard."

Again, although it was negative cash flow for us for the quarter, if you look at the components, that was really driven by working capital, which is typical for us in that typically inventory purchases in Q4 are higher for a number of reasons and the payments for those inventory purchases occur in Q1. So that's what's drives it. But on a full year basis, we're still looking at growing our operating cash flow, probably consistent with our bottom line growth rate, our net income growth year-over-year. So we still believe we can generate strong cash flow on a full year basis with some growth similar to our bottom line growth. We did also have, during the quarter, a little bit of duplicative inventory in consolidating some warehouses in Europe, specifically Germany. Over the balance of the year, that inventory level will come down. We did that as a precautionary measure as we're moving, consolidating distribution centers in Germany. We typically have inventory -- excess inventory that we manage through over the next few months. So again, we still feel that operating cash flow will continue to be strong and grow over the prior year."

We would like just for that to continue. I don't think acceleration there is something that we can expect, but we do expect that for the foreseeable future, that we can continue to put up high single to low double-digit sales growth. I think we're pleased that across all of our businesses and all of our markets, we think patient traffic has been healthy. U.S. dental patient traffic has been healthy as well as even in the European markets, although not in every market. But as we said in the prepared comments, even markets like Spain that over the last year or 2 had some challenges in market growth, was a strong grower for us.

And so the pipeline is as full as ever. Of course, there's no guarantee as to when we can close the deal. Deals with us often take many years from the time we start talking to people to the time we close. And there's not much that's related to the financial markets per se. So we remain quite optimistic that we'll continue with our internal growth and supplement the growth with acquisitions. We have committed that we will use our cash flow in 3 ways. One is to buy shares. One is to invest in the business, although investing in the business sometimes is not as important from a cash flow point of view because we're a net generator of cash, but we nevertheless do invest in the business some of the cash flow. But it's essentially from the buying of stock and the investment in acquisitions, and we continue to expect that trend to continue, as it has for years now."

Our Animal Health strategy encompasses 2 major focus. One is to advance geographic presence throughout the world. Wherever there's a middle-class that is interested in pets, we'd like to be there, and selectively in the production side, but very, very selectively. And it's not necessarily where the largest markets are, but there are opportunities. So for example, we do a good job in dairy in Ireland and New Zealand. And there's those kinds of opportunities, plus some opportunities in equine. So we want to get a large geographic footprint. And then we want to focus on a couple of things. First is pharma market share around the world. And in that connection, we work with large pharma companies, but also some of the generic companies. Two is we want to find unique products to put through these channels. And in that connection, there are opportunities in the areas such as instruments where we acquired a company, Veterinary Instruments, several years ago and are taking products around the world and doing quite well with that. The second is in the area of med-surg products. We acquired KRUUSE out of Scandinavia. They do business in about 100 countries. And we are advancing their product offering and their market share throughout the world and particularly through the Henry Schein channels. And then the third is equipment, and in that area, we included diagnostics. Equipment include, of course, imaging equipment, surgical equipment and the diagnostics. Under that category, there's also some disposable diagnostics. And diagnostics, in particular, tie into the third area which is the area of software and -- and the connectivity between software and devices and big data. We've been investing in all those areas, not only in actual software providers such as Medarex and the other companies we acquired over the last 4 or 5 years. And today, we have the largest installed base of practice management software in a number of countries, including the U.S., where over half of veterinarians are using our software. So it's the installation software and data. And in that connection, we invested in Vetstreet last quarter, and we have a number of other opportunities to capitalize on data. So that's the broad strategy. Now to address diagnostics specifically. Diagnostics is not necessarily about the machine per se. It's about the interoperability, the connection between the practice management software and diagnostics. We have invested in Axis-Q which is -- we -- I think we launched in January a year ago. Axis-Q is doing quite well in terms of market acceptance. And we expect more connectivity between Axis-Q to the reference lab and of course, to the diagnostic machinery. Bottom line is, if you're asking about how we're doing specifically in North America, which is where you refer to a particular company not wishing to do business with us anymore, we actually had a very good first quarter, not only in the products we represent, the Abaxis and the Heska product, but also with the skill product offering, the company we acquired in Europe that has a line of connectivity products and its own products. So we're doing quite well in the diagnostic space in North America and by the way, in Europe as well. So it's a broad strategy of geographic penetration and product penetration in terms of pharmaceuticals, the specialized areas that we've acquired our presence in, and the technology area."

With respect to operating margin, the goal is still to get operating margin expansion for the full year, and we typically don't see much of it in Q1 for a number of reasons. But again, stripping out some of those unusual items, we did get 23 basis points of margin expansion in Q1, but we expect to get further operating margin expansion for the full year. And I'm trying to remember, Jason, there was a third part to your question, but I'm not sure I remember it."

Looking at the bottom line, double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS represents a solid start to the year. We also are pleased to affirm guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share, which represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the adjusted 2015 results. We have made good progress across the board in all of our businesses in advancing our strategic plan. The morale in the company is great. The management team, I think, is well positioned and focused.

I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pretax or $0.04 per d",1473,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2016. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $4.1 million pretax or $0.04 per diluted share. Also, our Q1 2015 results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the second quarter of 2016.  I will be discussing our reports -- our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which is excluding those restructuring costs in both periods, as we believe the latter is useful for comparative purposes.  Exhibit B to this morning's news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations.
Turning to our results, net sales for the quarter ended March 26, 2016, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 10.1% increase compared with the first quarter of 2015. This consisted of 12.0% growth in local currencies and a 1.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 9.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.7%. I think it's important to note that when you normalize our sales for switches between agency sales and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for Q1 was 6.1%. Again, you can note the details of sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning.
Operating margin, as reported for the first quarter of 2016, was 6.5% and contracted by 6 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2015. However, when excluding restructuring costs, acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and also excluding the impact of switching between agency and direct sales, our adjusted operating margin expanded by 23 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%. And on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring costs, it was slightly less at 30.4%. This compares with 30.8% in the first quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. We expect our effective tax rates on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $116.8 million or $1.41 per diluted share. That represents increases of 7.7% and 10.2%, respectively, compared with the first quarter. As a reminder, about 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we do not hedge against that translation exposure. And although foreign exchange impact was less than the prior year, it was still approximately $0.02 dilutive to our EPS in the current quarter.
I'll now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the first quarter of 2016 increased 4.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 6.1% growth in local currencies and a 2.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.2%. The North American internal growth in local currencies was 6.4% and included 4.6% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and 13.5% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales growth was highlighted by market share gains and higher sales to large group practices, dental service organizations and community health centers. Our growth in equipment sales and service revenue reflected particular strength in high-tech equipment.
The international internal growth in local currencies was 2.3%. That included 1.6% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 4.3% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. Our consumable merchandise sales internationally was led by France, Australia and Spain. And growth in equipment sales and service revenue was led by Germany, France and Australia. 
Our Animal Health sales was $771.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12.7%. This included growth of 15.6% in local currencies and a 2.9% decline related to foreign currencies. Internal sales in local currencies grew by 9.8%, while acquisitions contributed 5.8% to growth. The North American growth in internal sales in local currencies was 16.7%. However, it's important to note that, that reflects a 7.4% growth when we normalize results to again account for the impact of certain products switching between agency sales and direct sales.  We believe this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American health business and also reflects the strength of the broader animal health market. Our International Animal Health internal growth in local currencies was 3.1%.
Turning to medical, our medical sales were $538.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 21.3%. This consisted of 21.5% growth in local currencies and a small 0.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange. The 21.5% growth in local currencies breaks out between 22.3% growth in North America and 2% growth internationally. Both of those numbers are internally generated. When normalizing for the impact of agency sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, the North American Medical internal sales growth was 11.2%, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains.  We believe we have been outperforming the medical market by a significant margin for the past 5 quarters, as we have effectively capitalized on the growing market trend towards large group practices. 
Technology and value-added service sales were $101.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 18.6%. This included 19.9% growth in local currencies and a 1.3% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 7.5% and acquisition growth was 12.4%.  The 7.5% internal growth in local currencies consisted of 8.0% growth in North America and 5.1% growth internationally. I think it's important to also note that through product upgrades, enhancements and strategic acquisitions, the advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for real improvement and efficiency in delivering of health care services. There are also new sales opportunities and practice success across all of our business groups.
I'll talk about stock repurchase. During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 664,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $150.51 per share, and that's approximately $100 million of cash flow. The impact on this repurchase in the fourth -- in the first quarter to our EPS was less than $0.01 of accretion. At the close of the quarter, we still had approximately $300 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. And we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value.
I'll take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $101.5 million. That compares to negative $26.7 million in Q1 last year, but I think most people realize that first quarter cash flow for us is typically negative due to seasonality in working capital during the quarter. We continue to believe that on a full year basis, we will have strong operating cash flow for the year.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding was 42.1 days, which compares to 41.2 days last year. Inventory turns was 5.1 turns this quarter and compares to 5.3 turns last year.
I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2016 financial guidance as follows. For 2016, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS last year of $5.96. Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions. It also does not include the impact of restructuring costs, which were expected to be the range of $0.10 to $0.13 per diluted share.  Also, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates will continue to be generally consistent with current levels. 
Last, I'd like to remind you that we report our results on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So for fiscal 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], we will have 53 weeks. The extra week for us is in Q4 2016. But since that 53rd week is a holiday week at the end of the year and sales are usually lower than a typical week, the extra week does not materially add to our earnings, since fixed expenses remain relatively constant with that slow sales week.
So with that financial review, I'll turn it back to Stanley."

Let me begin my review of our first business groups with Dental. We are quite pleased to report Global Dental internal sales growth in local currency of nearly 5%, with particular strength in equipment, which speaks to the overall health of the broader dental market. From a strategic perspective, establishing Henry Schein in Japan has been a long-standing corporate goal. Japan after all is the world's second-largest dental market. And through 2 important investment positions, we are now well on our way in that important market. 
You may, of course, recall that we established a presence in Japan in October 2014 with an investment in USA dental supply. Late in the first quarter, we expanded our Japanese presence by partnering with J. Morita. We have known J. Morita for many years. They are one of the world's largest manufacturers and distributors of dental equipment and supplies, and we hold the company in high regard.  More specifically, we acquired a 50% interest in their One Piece subsidiary. One Piece is composed of 8 dental dealers located across Japan. They serve approximately 6,000 dental clinics, and they had sales in fiscal 2015 of approximately USD 125 million. We look forward to other Japanese dealers joining our partnership in the near future. Japan has about 90,000 dentists and about 64,000 dental clinics. And with the addition of One Piece, we now serve approximately 20% of the market. 
Also, during the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a Brazilian distributor of dental supplies and equipment. Brazil holds good potential for our Dental Group as well, and this investment builds upon our existing business there, which we established in 2014 as well. I discussed Dental Cremer during our last quarter call, and we look forward to closing this transaction later this year.
Regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we are seeing strong growth in sales of our digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. Henry Schein offers multiple brands of digital impression scanning solutions here in North America. And given our desire to promote an open architecture and provide dentists with innovative, robust and efficient choices for restorative dentistry, believe we have an excellent offering. Of course, in Europe, we do sell and we believe are the most significant distributor of the CEREC Sirona solution for CAD/CAM. In addition, we continue to be well positioned in the lab market on a global basis, providing solutions for digital restorations that are outsourced for the lab facilities.
Last week, Align Technology and 3shape announced that several of 3shape's digital scanners will be compatible for use with Invisalign case submissions later this year. The 2 companies also announced an agreement to enhance digital workflow between iTero scanners and laboratory partners using 3shape dental software. Like Henry Schein, this announcement makes clear that Align supports an open systems approach to digital impressions, and we are pleased to be advancing along the same lines. 
Several months ago, we attended the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting, which is an important trade show for our company. Among our many activities at this year's events, we introduced BruxZir NOW milling blocks system. This system is compatible with the Glidewell TS150 mil, which will now enable practitioners to offer patients high-strength, authentic zirconia restorations in one visit. This system furthers our commitment to our expanding CAD/CAM product category here in North America and of course, throughout the world and to the future of digital dentistry on a global basis.
We're very excited with the progress we're making on all fronts in our dental business in the core consumable business, the equipment business, the implant business, the other specialty areas and of course, in our CAD/CAM solutions in the dental office chairside and of course, through our digital highway into the lab and our presence within the laboratory space, both in North America and abroad, in Australia or New Zealand, Europe, et cetera, and I might add, even now in Asia.
Let me now touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currency here in North America was 7.4%. We're making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio. These products are typically sold under multiyear lease. And as those agreements come to an end, we're looking forward to adding even more diagnostic customers to our base. Many of our customers have multiyear agreements in place. And I think that and our team is very confident that our offering will be appropriate for the dental marketplace, the animal health marketplace here in North America and in Europe and Australia and New Zealand. The diagnostic offering we have will be well positioned to assume many of those leases as they mature. We are also targeting large practices that may be seeking to purchase additional diagnostic instruments to handle their higher volume patient testing needs, whether it is machinery or the quick test disposable. 
Earlier in the quarter at the North American veterinary conference in Orlando, we announced that Axis-Q command center software was available in the U.S. for Abaxis and Heska systems. This software links our practice management software with diagnostics instruments. We have received quite a positive response, excellent feedback from veterinarians who value the efficient and integrated workflow and revenue capture features offered by Axis-Q.
Our International Animal Health growth in local currencies during the first quarter was more than 13%, which reflects the positive contribution of a number of strategic acquisitions we have completed last year, many in Europe. Again, we are very, very pleased with the progress we're making across the board, across the globe with our Animal Health team, also just like our dental team, great leadership focused on executing our strategic plan and doing a great job on the ground in each of the countries we're in, but also advancing our strategic product offering that we are driving through our local distribution entities throughout the world. Very, very pleased with the management and the progress that our Animal Health team are executing on.
Now on the medical side. The reported growth in our medical group is impacted by agency sales in the prior year under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. Yet when normalizing for this, the core internal growth for the North American Medical business was a robust 11.2% as, of course, Steven mentioned earlier on. We remain highly optimistic about our ability to win new customers in the medical space. We have completed the material components of the Cardinal integration and have experienced positive feedback from the customers that came along with this merger of the 2 physician businesses and the ASC businesses.  We continue to partner with Cardinal on combined proposals to large IDNs and have had a number of wins. Finally, the Cardinal sales organization that came along with this merger on the physician side has been fully integrated, and we continue to see expansion in our market share within the nonacute space.
Let me conclude the review of our businesses with an overview of the technology and value-added services part of the business. We are generally pleased with the first quarter performance of this business group, which includes the highest quarterly growth rate in North America in nearly 2 years, with particular strength in software and financial services. Early in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Vetstreet, and a month later, we acquired RxWorks. Both transactions strengthened our position of leadership and add value to our customer base worldwide. This is not just a U.S. strategy on the Animal Health side, but a global strategy. And we believe we have by far the largest installed base of animal health practice management systems, both in this country and on a global basis, being in a position to provide huge support to our customer base and also our manufacturing partners, who are seeking the information that we can provide as a result of this installed base, in other words, the data and the alignment with our sales organizations as we execute on aligned interest with our manufacturing partners.
As I discussed during the last quarterly call -- quarter call, Vetstreet is a leading domestic provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics. We are particularly excited about the potential to pair our practice management software solutions with the Vetstreet data analytics capability, really, really exciting. There's no one else in our industry, we believe, that has this capability to support not only information that will help the practitioners improve the operations and profitability and care they provide in their practices as well as support the needs of our manufacturers, specifically on the pharmaceutical side who are seeking to get their products to market. 
RxWorks is a practice management software company, serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands. RxWorks' brings an installed base of more than 1,500 clinics, strengthens our growing practice management software business and complements our expanding Animal Health technology platform.
A moment ago, I mentioned the Chicago midwinter conference, and another one of our launches there was DEXIS for Dentrix Ascend. This cloud-based imaging solution was built exclusively for Dentrix Ascend and helps to quickly capture and store images. Doing so eliminates the need for additional digital imaging software and automates daily procedures such as insurance billing. This software is initially available to users in North America and exemplifies our commitment to provide digital solutions that improve workflow and allow for better clinical care.
So much of the Henry Schein's future and -- is directly tied to our digital solutions that will help, of course, not only in the dental space, where we have imaging and prosthetic solutions that we are offering, and we'll expand that offering in the near future and over in the years to come in an exciting way, but the same kind of dynamics, interoperability exists as a huge opportunity in our Animal Health space and in our medical space.  So let me comment on some recent announcements of 2 new corporate positions that we have established at Henry Schein, aimed at advancing our commercial capabilities and of course, driving growth opportunities.
Dave McKinley, the president of our Henry Schein Medical group, has been promoted to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer for Henry Schein corporate. Specifically, Dave will be responsible for the following 4 areas: global corporate marketing, working across the business to leverage Henry Schein's brand. We have a great brand in 4 of our different business areas, and we'd like to capitalize on that to advance the overall brand of Henry Schein as a company focused on solutions to the office space practitioner in the dental, medical and Animal Health space. There are huge opportunities, we believe, to advance global product category management for the company as a whole across the platform. And then there are the technology initiatives, including customer solutions, e-commerce and business intelligence that we have in many, many parts of our business that we feel we can optimize and drive these technologies on a common platform throughout the Henry Schein organization. And then Dave will take responsibility for certain specialty businesses.  Over the last decade plus Dave has been with Henry Schein, he has made a significant contribution to the company's success, starting with his initial responsibilities for leading our prosthetic business over a decade ago, including initial -- developing the initial business plan for E4D, CAD/CAM products and CAMLOG. Both of these products in the end or actually today are doing quite well for Henry Schein, and Dave led the initial development of the business plan and the early execution of those business plans. He also laid the foundation for what is a currently highly effective dental practice solutions management team on the dental side in Utah. So Dave has been at the forefront of driving change, effective change, at Henry Schein and making a real difference in our strategic platform.  So we thank Dave for the terrific work he's done to-date in the prosthetics field, in the practice solutions field, and of course, most recently in the last 7 years or so, in developing initially with Mike Racioppi and then with the senior -- rest of the senior management team, our medical strategies, particularly our Healthcare Services group, which is the group that services the large practices and then effectively executing on those plans, showing the tremendous results that we've experienced with the Medical Group over the last years.
Karen Prange, Senior Vice President at Boston Scientific Corporation, will join Henry Schein as the Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of our Global Animal Health, medical and dental surgical group. This is a new group we've established with Henry Schein. Karen will be -- also be a member of our executive management team, by the way as Dave will continue. 
The senior management team who will support Karen's group are in the animal health area. Peter McCarthy, who will continue to serve as the president of our Global Animal Health group, Peter, who joined Henry Schein about 6 years ago from a large pharma company, really created what is today a very, very successful international business for Henry Schein in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and then assumed an overall leadership of our Animal Health group in the middle of 2015 -- has been a really major contributor to advancing our global animal health platform results, strategy to develop those results that resulted in these terrific results. Peter and his team are doing excellent work in our growing Animal Health business which is showing, of course, excellent results. And pursuing -- Peter and the team are pursuing many of the new and exciting opportunities, both to expand our global presence and our unique product offering in the Animal Health space.
Brad Connett, also a Henry Schein veteran, 20-plus years, has been promoted to President of the commercial group in the United States medical business. And Jeff Waldman, Chief Administrative Officer -- Chief Administrative Operations Officer for our U.S. medical group will take an additional functional responsibility for sales, operations and finance. Brad has done a remarkable job in leading our sales and positioning in the medical markets, a highly regarded executive in the medical space. And Jeff, also an executive over a decade, has been very, very -- has contributed in a very, very nice way in many parts of Henry Schein on the financial and the operational side. Both of these promotions are reflective of Brad and Jeff's success in helping to drive growth in the Henry Schein Medical business.
Rene Willi will continue to serve as president of our rapidly growing Global Dental Surgical Group. Rene, also a seasoned implant oral surgery executive; along with Steve Bogan, President and CEO of the highly successful BioHorizons implant business, one of the fastest-growing implant businesses in the world; and Michael Ludwick, general manager of our CAMLOG German business, we are -- and Michael has done a remarkable job in establishing the very important position of CAMLOG in Germany. And their teams have done yeoman's work in leading our implant business and positioning us at Henry Schein as one of the world's leading implant companies.
So Karen has deep background in health care, extensive experience in managing large matrix organizations, will be joining us in the middle of May. Throughout Karen's career, she has demonstrated an ability to bring people together, manage change and grow businesses, a 17-year veteran of J&J and most recently, for the last 4 years or so, at Boston Scientific.
So we have created these new positions at a time when market, technology and demographic forces are converging in one of the most unique ways, and at least in my 35-plus years at Henry Schein, to create unique business opportunities for the company. We believe Dave and Karen's leadership will help us to capitalize on the significant opportunities before us. We are particularly pleased with a deep bench of management we have in each of the 3 business units that we just discussed, the Animal Health area, the medical area and, of course, the oral surgery implant area and related products.
I would also like to comment on some upcoming changes that we anticipate with respect to Henry Schein's Board of Directors that are noted in our current proxy statement and we have voted on at our March -- at our May, sorry, 31st annual meeting of stockholders. We have proposed the addition of 2 new directors to take the seats of 2 long-serving directors, who will be retiring from our board. The retiring directors, Norman Matthews and Dr. Lou Sullivan, both have helped guide Henry Schein through a period of unprecedented growth and change. Norman has been a director since 2002, an experienced professional director who has enormous credibility in the marketplace and contributed in a significant way to Henry Schein's growth for almost 14 years. Dr. Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health, similar track record. Dr. Sullivan joined us, our board, in 2003. Both Norman and Dr. Sullivan have been a part of Henry Schein's successful journey over the past decade from a time when the company served only dental and medical customers. I think our sales in the 2002, '03 time frame was something like $2.8 billion. At the close of 2015, our net sales were up nearly fourfold to $10.6 billion. And of course, we now serve Animal Health practitioners on a worldwide basis. In fact, Animal Health sales in 2015 were more than our company's entire sales at the time Norman Matthews joined our board.
I could go on at length about the contributions and character of both Norman Matthews and Dr. Sullivan. But instead, on behalf of my colleagues at Henry Schein, my fellow directors and of course, our shareholders, we simply say thank you for your contribution. You have both contributed in a significant way to creating significant shareholder value for the Henry Schein shareholders. 
We are fortunate to have 2 new director nominees on the proxy, who will bring excellent and complete, complementary skills to our board. The first is Joseph Herring, whose career in health care spans more than 35 years. He served as CEO of Covance for more than a decade, up through the acquisition by LabCorp about a year ago. Earlier in his career, Joseph held very senior leadership positions with Caremark International and American Hospital Supply. Upon his election to the Henry Schein board, Joe will bring to Henry Schein comprehensive knowledge on pharmaceutical management sales and of course, guiding fast-growing -- experience in growing fast-growth companies.
Kurt Kuehn is our second board nominee. Kurt spent his entire career at United Postal Services and served as the UPS CFO for 8 years through his retirement last year. At UPS, Kurt also had leadership roles in sales and marketing, engineering, operations and strategic cost planning. Clearly, Kurt is an expert in distribution logistics as well as corporate finance and accounting and was part of the UPS' successful transition from a pure transportation company to a logistics company that has enormous array of value-added services. We look forward to many -- to the many talents he will bring to Henry Schein. And so welcome, Joe and Kurt, to the proxy, and trust they will be elected overwhelmingly in May.
So with that commentary and overview of the quarterly financial operating performance, there just isn't the time today to go through all the exciting items that are being dealt with at Henry Schein across the board. The company is making advances on so many fronts in so many exciting ways. So now, operator, we're ready to take some questions."

Generally, I think dentists are feeling good about their practices. I think there is stability in patient visits. And I think dentists are understanding that investing in newer technology provides for better quality dental care, a better experience for the customer and actually results in a more profitable practice, of course, combined with quality of care. So I would say it's driven to a large extent by some of the newer technologies in the imaging side, on the prosthetics side. And we have a very good offering today of products that match the needs of the marketplace. We did add the A-dec line in North America, which is contributing. Having said that, I think our sales across the board, even with the existing portfolio of traditional equipment, has been good. So overall, it's good dynamics in the marketplace in terms of the dentists feeling good, the newer technology available and a little bit, the result of us expanding our offering with the A-dec product line. But I wouldn't put that much emphasis on that. A-dec is doing well with us, but it's also a relatively small part of the entire equipment portfolio, but it is doing well."

And we're seeing strong growth in the scan-onlys, which for us, we think, is very positive in the initial sale, but also positions the customer to come back to us in the future when they're looking to do chairside milling, and they can then buy the additional component from us at a later date. So CAD/CAM, the total category of complete systems and scan-onlys, was very strong for us. But it truly was across the board because traditional equipment as well as high tech was both strong."

So the majority of Cardinal's physician-related ultimate care customers have transitioned to our platform. And we are working together on a number of IDN sales opportunities. We've actually generated some very nice sales together. The particular situation, or the particular opportunity with Kaiser that Cardinal has -- the business they have won is less in our wheelhouse than the business we undertake day to day. I believe that it is more of a bulk distribution arrangement, and Cardinal is handling that from their distribution system. So that is not exactly the kind of business we anticipated working on together, but there are many, many IDNs that we are working on together and actually have landed quite a bit of business in that regard."

Again, although it was negative cash flow for us for the quarter, if you look at the components, that was really driven by working capital, which is typical for us in that typically inventory purchases in Q4 are higher for a number of reasons and the payments for those inventory purchases occur in Q1. So that's what's drives it. But on a full year basis, we're still looking at growing our operating cash flow, probably consistent with our bottom line growth rate, our net income growth year-over-year. So we still believe we can generate strong cash flow on a full year basis with some growth similar to our bottom line growth. We did also have, during the quarter, a little bit of duplicative inventory in consolidating some warehouses in Europe, specifically Germany. Over the balance of the year, that inventory level will come down. We did that as a precautionary measure as we're moving, consolidating distribution centers in Germany. We typically have inventory -- excess inventory that we manage through over the next few months. So again, we still feel that operating cash flow will continue to be strong and grow over the prior year."

We would like just for that to continue. I don't think acceleration there is something that we can expect, but we do expect that for the foreseeable future, that we can continue to put up high single to low double-digit sales growth. I think we're pleased that across all of our businesses and all of our markets, we think patient traffic has been healthy. U.S. dental patient traffic has been healthy as well as even in the European markets, although not in every market. But as we said in the prepared comments, even markets like Spain that over the last year or 2 had some challenges in market growth, was a strong grower for us.

And so the pipeline is as full as ever. Of course, there's no guarantee as to when we can close the deal. Deals with us often take many years from the time we start talking to people to the time we close. And there's not much that's related to the financial markets per se. So we remain quite optimistic that we'll continue with our internal growth and supplement the growth with acquisitions. We have committed that we will use our cash flow in 3 ways. One is to buy shares. One is to invest in the business, although investing in the business sometimes is not as important from a cash flow point of view because we're a net generator of cash, but we nevertheless do invest in the business some of the cash flow. But it's essentially from the buying of stock and the investment in acquisitions, and we continue to expect that trend to continue, as it has for years now."

Our Animal Health strategy encompasses 2 major focus. One is to advance geographic presence throughout the world. Wherever there's a middle-class that is interested in pets, we'd like to be there, and selectively in the production side, but very, very selectively. And it's not necessarily where the largest markets are, but there are opportunities. So for example, we do a good job in dairy in Ireland and New Zealand. And there's those kinds of opportunities, plus some opportunities in equine. So we want to get a large geographic footprint. And then we want to focus on a couple of things. First is pharma market share around the world. And in that connection, we work with large pharma companies, but also some of the generic companies. Two is we want to find unique products to put through these channels. And in that connection, there are opportunities in the areas such as instruments where we acquired a company, Veterinary Instruments, several years ago and are taking products around the world and doing quite well with that. The second is in the area of med-surg products. We acquired KRUUSE out of Scandinavia. They do business in about 100 countries. And we are advancing their product offering and their market share throughout the world and particularly through the Henry Schein channels. And then the third is equipment, and in that area, we included diagnostics. Equipment include, of course, imaging equipment, surgical equipment and the diagnostics. Under that category, there's also some disposable diagnostics. And diagnostics, in particular, tie into the third area which is the area of software and -- and the connectivity between software and devices and big data. We've been investing in all those areas, not only in actual software providers such as Medarex and the other companies we acquired over the last 4 or 5 years. And today, we have the largest installed base of practice management software in a number of countries, including the U.S., where over half of veterinarians are using our software. So it's the installation software and data. And in that connection, we invested in Vetstreet last quarter, and we have a number of other opportunities to capitalize on data. So that's the broad strategy. Now to address diagnostics specifically. Diagnostics is not necessarily about the machine per se. It's about the interoperability, the connection between the practice management software and diagnostics. We have invested in Axis-Q which is -- we -- I think we launched in January a year ago. Axis-Q is doing quite well in terms of market acceptance. And we expect more connectivity between Axis-Q to the reference lab and of course, to the diagnostic machinery. Bottom line is, if you're asking about how we're doing specifically in North America, which is where you refer to a particular company not wishing to do business with us anymore, we actually had a very good first quarter, not only in the products we represent, the Abaxis and the Heska product, but also with the skill product offering, the company we acquired in Europe that has a line of connectivity products and its own products. So we're doing quite well in the diagnostic space in North America and by the way, in Europe as well. So it's a broad strategy of geographic penetration and product penetration in terms of pharmaceuticals, the specialized areas that we've acquired our presence in, and the technology area."

So first, on the sales side, we should see on the medical side, the normalized sales growth continue at a very healthy rate. And I said earlier normalized somewhere in the high single to low double-digit range is what we think is achievable. We should see the impact of the agency sales shift related to the Cardinal transaction decrease in Q2 and virtually go away beyond that. Similarly, on the Animal Health side, we would see the growth that we experienced which was 7-and-change percent. We'd like to see that continue. There might be a little opportunity for acceleration there, and the agency shift will probably continue for the next few quarters. With respect to operating margin, the goal is still to get operating margin expansion for the full year, and we typically don't see much of it in Q1 for a number of reasons. But again, stripping out some of those unusual items, we did get 23 basis points of margin expansion in Q1, but we expect to get further operating margin expansion for the full year. And I'm trying to remember, Jason, there was a third part to your question, but I'm not sure I remember it."

I'll provide further information, further color on our performance during the second quarter, expectations for the rest of the year after Steven provides the specific information on our performance in the second quarter. 
Generally though, our North American Dental sales were a little bit below our expectations in the second quarter. However, sales in our Medical, Animal Health, Technology, Value-Added Services businesses were strong as well as in aspects of our North American Dental business, and we will again provide further color on specifics after you had the details from Steven. 
Over the years, our business has been quite predictable. And as an organization, Henry Schein has been able to adapt, seize opportunities and address challenges. We believe that our business model and strategic plan, including our continued investments, will drive our growth over the long term, and in fact, in the medium term, and we remain extremely well-positioned at each of the vertical markets we serve, not only to gain market share but of course, to manage our investments very carefully. 
We have a seasoned management team that is very good at these points and particularly at gaining market share and managing our investments in a very strategic away. 
On a granular level, looking at plans for the U.K. to leave the European Union, they are on a very early stage in what is -- which is likely to be a 2-year process, many say not much stuff until early next year. Surely, there will be developments along the way, but let me be clear that Henry Schein's commitment to the U.K. remains unchanged and so does our commitment to the European Union. We continue to believe that the U.K. and Europe on the whole represent attractive long-term opportunities in both our dental and Animal Health businesses and past even in our Medical business in the long term. We expect to continue to execute well in our value-added customer approach just as we did before the Brexit vote. 
In a moment, I'll provide, as I said, additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. But first, Steven will review the specifics around our financial results."

As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include rest",2078,"Okay, thank you. Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include restructuring costs of $20.4 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share. Our prior year Q2 2015 results also include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. 
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes those restructuring costs as we believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see our Exhibit B to this morning's earnings release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
So turning to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 25, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. This consisted of 9.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 7.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.1%. 
Also when further normalizing the switches between agency and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for the company for Q2 was 5.8%. You can see the details of our sales growth also contained in today's earnings news release on Exhibit A. 
If you look at the operating margin on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2016, it was 6.3% and contracted 67 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase in restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year negatively impacted the contraction by 43 basis points. 
Acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses as well as the switches from agency to direct sales also combined to negatively impact our contraction by 9 basis points. The remaining contraction was primarily driven by lower-than-expected sales growth in our North American Dental business relative to our other businesses. As a result of this, we have extended our restructuring period to the end of 2016 in order to continue to reduce our cost structure. 
Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, our effective tax rate was 27.4%. This compares with an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. 
As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate this quarter reflects approximately $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable proposed tax settlement. We also expect this settlement to reduce our ongoing effective tax rate going forward. More specifically, we anticipate that our effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the 29% range for the remainder of the year, and previously, we had guided that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the 30% range. 
If we look at net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis, it was $120.1 million or $1.46 per diluted share, representing increases of 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, our adjusted net income attributable to Henry Schein was $135.4 million or $1.64 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 9.9% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. 
Foreign exchange impact on diluted EPS for the quarter was not material. I'd also like to note that at current exchange rates, we expect the foreign exchange translation of our -- outside of the U.S. earnings to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half of the year by at least $0.02 per diluted share, and that's related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound sterling. 
Let me now provide some detail on sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4% to $1.4 billion. This consisted of 4.1% growth in constant currencies and a small 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.3%. 
Our North American internal growth in constant currencies was 2%, and it included 1.8% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
As we noted in our press release, our Q2 dental sales in North America reflect softness that began in early June. Our performance was also impacted by a decision to stop selling certain precious metals products. These products have a very low gross margin and are relatively immaterial to our profitability. Precious metal sales negatively impacted our North American Dental merchandise sales growth in Q2 by approximately 50 basis points. So again, if you -- our growth would be 50 basis points higher without the decision to stop selling precious metals. 
This will continue to impact our merchandise sales growth until it annualizes. So it will continue for the next 3 quarters. As Stanley mentioned, we are extremely well positioned among our dental customers, and we will continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will drive our growth over the long term. 
Looking at international internal growth in local currencies, our Dental Group was 4.2% growth and included 4.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 3.1% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. That growth internationally was driven specifically by Italy, France and Spain, to a large extent. 
Animal Health sales were $853.6 million in the second quarter. That was an increase of 14%. This included growth of 15.2% in local currencies and a decline of 1.2% related to foreign currency exchange. Our internal sales in local currencies grew 11.8%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 3.4% to our growth. 
Looking at the North American Animal Health sales. Internal sales growth in constant currencies was 18.8%. And when normalizing the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, our growth was 11.4% in North America. We believe this normalized growth rate is more -- is a more meaningful -- sorry, I mean, more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business and also reflects the strength of a broader Animal Health market. Our international Animal Health sales growth internally in constant currencies was 4.9%. 
Looking at our Medical Group. Our Medical sales were $538.8 million in the second quarter, and that was an increase of 14.4%. Foreign exchange had virtually no impact on our sales growth. That 14.5% growth included 14.9% growth in North America and 2.4% growth in local currencies internationally. Again, when normalizing for the impact of agency sales in the prior year, North American internal growth was 10.4%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains for our North American Medical business. 
So, indeed, we have been outperforming the Medical market by a fairly significant margin for the past 6 quarters, and we have effectively capitalized the growing market trend towards larger group practices, including IDNs or integrated delivery networks. 
Our Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $107 million for the quarter, representing a 19.6% growth. This included 20.4% growth in constant currencies and a 0.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated growth was 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 12.3%. The 8.1% internal growth in local currencies included 8.5% growth in North America and 6.4% growth internationally. I'd like to highlight that our North American sales growth included more than 20% growth in our financial services business. 
Our financial services business includes equipment and practice financing, credit card processing, practice brokerage and patient collections as well as other services. Our core software products and upgrades of Technology and Value-Added Services businesses also aims to provide customers with solutions that are efficient and patient friendly, allowing them to generate more business, manage content among multiple sites and improve the overall Practice Management. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. More specifically, we purchased 337,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $169.41, and that represented about $57 million. The impact on the current quarter of that purchase was immaterial to our EPS. I think it's important to note at the close of the quarter, we had approximately $243 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock, and we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activity, will continue to provide increased shareholder value. 
If we look at some brief highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million compared to $207 million in the prior year, and we believe we'll continue to have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding was 40.8 days this quarter compares to 39.3 days last year. Inventory turns for the quarter were 5.6 turns, and that compares to 5.8 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2016 financial guidance. We are revising our guidance due to the impact of a number of factors. These factors include the ongoing business and economic uncertainty related to the Brexit vote, which will have the potential impact on the U.K. as well as the rest of Europe. As noted earlier, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling at current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half by at least $0.02, and this new guidance also includes a cautious view of the North American Dental market. 
So for 2016, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $6.55 to $6.60, which represents growth of 10% to 11% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.96. All of these adjusted diluted EPS numbers exclude restructuring costs, and this compares to our previous guidance, which was $6.55 to $6.65. 
Our guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only, given that the company cannot reasonably project the restructuring cost that we expect to incur in the second half of 2016. For the same reason, the company is unable to address the probable significance of that information. 
Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions as well as restructuring costs. We now anticipate that the restructuring initiatives will continue into the second half of the year as we continue to reduce our operating costs in light of some of these market conditions. 
At this time, again, we're not able to provide estimates for this impact in our 2016 financial results. 
Specifically for Q3, we expect our growth in adjusted diluted EPS, again excluding restructuring costs, to be in the mid single digits. So mid-single-digit growth for Q3, but we, obviously, expect the growth to accelerate in Q4. This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels as of now. However, we do believe that there's a possibility that U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen. And remember that 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
Also, I'd like to conclude by mentioning that our fourth quarter results since we're on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December include an extra week. So 2016 consists of 53 weeks. The extra week is in Q4 of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], and it's the last week of our fiscal year, which is the holiday week at the end of the year. So sales are typically lower during that week, and we typically don't have the same level of profitability because of fixed costs remaining relatively constant. 
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call over back to Stanley."
339447,376893430,1024903,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with dental. As Steven noted, North America dental sales were impacted by softness in the U.S. that began in early June. We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and",1778,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with dental. As Steven noted, North America dental sales were impacted by softness in the U.S. that began in early June. We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and our commitment to delivering value to their practices will continue to be key to our long-term success, and as in the past, will enable us to continue to gain market share not only in the United States but globally in the dental market. Although the sales growth was slower than expected in the second quarter, we believe we have a proven and successful model of delivering value-added solutions to our customers, and we have increased our focus on delivering on better sales results in the short term. 
As evidence of this commitment, during our second quarter, we announced an investment in Custom Automated Prosthetics, known as CAP. CAP is a U.S. digital laboratory supply company with 2015 sales of approximately $30 million. They offer CAD/CAM equipment as well as a full line of zirconia materials. The integration of CAP with Zahn, which is our dental laboratory business, and our Custom Milling Center furthers our commitment to providing dental laboratory customers with a greater selection of digital equipment, materials and services. We believe these products will help them, our laboratory customers, to navigate through the important digital transition that is occurring in the dental technology space today and I might add, at a rapid pace. 
Further supporting our commitment to advance technology and to help prepare the next generation of dental professionals for advances in digital dentistry, in May, we announced the opening of the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Kornberg School of Dentistry. Technology advancements are affecting almost every aspect of the practice of dentistry, and we are committed not only to bring those advancements to our customers, but also to making sure our current and future customers are well versed in all aspects of running an efficient and profitable practice while allowing for high-quality patient care. 
Dental students and faculty at Temple University now have access to the latest 3D imaging equipment, intraoral scanners and milling machines made available as a result of this partnership. 
Regarding our dental -- digital -- sorry, regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we continue to see strong growth in sales of digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. The breadth of our product offering is reflected -- is reflective of our belief that customers want choice and open architecture for their restorative dentistry needs. This also creates opportunity for follow-on software and mill sales when these dental practices are ready to move to full scale in our system. 
With Zahn Dental and CAP, we continue to be well positioned to provide innovative solutions to the lab market for restorations that are outsourced from the practice. Let me just add that in North America, CAD/CAM sales were strong in the second quarter, driven by digital scanner sales while our traditional sales for -- traditional equipment sales were soft and I might add, partially due to timing. 
Lastly, I'd like to comment on a recent change in our Global Dental surgical team. As of June, BioHorizons has become the exclusive distributor of Camlog-branded products in the United States and Canada. This creates a unified sales force in the U.S. for complete dental offerings to specialists and general practitioners. By combining the 2 sales forces for these high-quality, complementary brands, we are creating a more efficient go-to-market strategy, giving our customers access to a greater selection of products and services from high-quality branded to high-quality economy implants with a wide variety of clinical-based products. It also will afford more robust North American coverage and strengthening our position to effectively compete and grow our market share in, as I said, the premium and the value-added segments of the dental implant market. We look forward to continued success in this important segment. These businesses are and actually have been doing quite well for a while. 
Now let me turn and -- of course, happy to answer more questions on the dental side during the rest of the call. 
On the Animal Health side, as Steven mentioned, when normalizing for Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.4% in North America, reflective of a healthy market but also reflective of market share gains we have been gaining market share in North America in the Animal Health arena for a while now. 
International currencies sales during the second quarter were up 12%, with organic growth complemented by acquisition growth. We are making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio, targeting practices that are nearing end of the instrument lease agreements as well as growing clinics with a need for multiple systems for high-volume testing. 
Indeed, sales of diagnostic products in North America grew in the low double digits in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. We believe this is ahead of the market growth in this sector. 
Axis-Q continues to be an attractive element of our sales proposals as customers are strong benefits and efficiency -- see strong benefits in efficiently linking their Practice Management Software with their diagnostic instruments. This is a holistic approach. It's not selling devices nor is it selling software. It's the interoperability of devices and software connected to the Practice Management system, the clinical workstation. 
As a reminder, Henry Schein's Practice Management Software is today used by more than 50% of the U.S. veterinary practices. Again, strategy here in the Animal Health space is doing very well, well thought out and being well-executed, of course, not only in the U.S. but throughout the world in the Animal Health arena, where Henry Schein is, in fact, active. 
Let me now turn to Medical. The reported growth in our Medical Group of 14.5% was impacted by agency sales in the prior year. When normalizing for this impact, the core internal growth for North America Medical was 10.4% as Steven mentioned, and let me stress, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains. We continue to see solid growth from large group practices, including IDNs, Integrated Delivery Networks, as we onboard new customer wins from the past year. These are internal growth wins that we've been working on for a while and that are bearing fruit. 
In addition, the expansion of large health systems, with which we have built strong relationships over the past several years, is good contributing to our growth. Our focus on the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market is yielding solid results as well as we are seeing strong sales in this sector, and our teams are making inroads with our smaller market segments, including universities and sports medicine. So we have a growing base of customers who rely on our broad, Value-Added Services model. 
Now let me talk about the Technology and Value-Added Services group. We are pleased again with the second quarter performance of this business group. North American Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 8.5% in local currencies, matched the highest growth rate in more than 3 years. Strategic acquisitions that bolstered our market share in this business as sales in local currencies increased by more than 21% in North America during the second quarter, by nearly 15% internationally. 
Of course, we are very pleased with these results as reported to the P&L of these businesses, but let me remind our investors that, in fact, it's the stickiness, the Value-Added Services that our practice solutions group brings to bear in our customer base that has the real strategic value. Enhancing digital platforms across the businesses we serve is an important priority for Henry Schein, in fact, one of our largest and perhaps most important priorities. We provide a means for our customers to better connect with their patients and improve overall efficiency, thereby, reinforcing our value to their practices and in fact, allowing our customers to show their value to their patients. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to drive interoperability with devices and of course, the cloud to manage workflows. 
We are very, very pleased with the progress we made specifically on our cloud-based dental product and the connection between our Practice Management Software and the devices in the dental space, whether it is in the imaging area or in the prosthetics area. Likewise, as I reported earlier on, in the Animal Health space with our diagnostic and imaging product offerings that are connected so well to our Practice Management Software, which will only get better over time. 
So as you may know, 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ] was a special year for Henry Schein as we mark 20 years as a publicly traded company. In May, we had the opportunity to celebrate this milestone as we opened trading at the NASDAQ stock market. 20 years ago, we had a vision for what Henry Schein could become. Since then, more and more people have joined us in sharing that vision in building our company and expanding our presence in the global markets we serve, and all the while we have demonstrated we can successfully serve shareholders while also serving society and of course, our suppliers and our customers and the team. We are pleased to have accomplished so much as a result of the hard work of Team Schein Members across the globe over the past 2 -- 20 years since we've been public. 
We continue to be most optimistic about our strategies. We are unwavering in executing our strategic plan, which revolves around the notion of helping practitioners operate a more efficient practice while providing better clinical care. We feel that we have the right strategies and the tactics in place, and we'll, of course, make sure that we manage our expenses in a way that delivers on our commitments to our shareholders. 
Lastly, we are pleased to announce that in June, Henry Schein moved up to #268 in the ranking of Fortune 500, celebrating our 13th year as one of America's largest corporations. This is testament to more than 19,000 Team Schein Members throughout the world, who are dedicated to helping our customers build better practices so they can provide better quality care. We of, course, have been on the list of the Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the entire period. 
So with that commentary and an overview of our quarterly results from both a financial and operating performance point of view, I would thank you for your attention, and we, of course, are ready to answer any questions that shareholders may have."

But, Steve, when I look at your guidance, you're taking it down $0.05 at the top, another $0.05 if I adjust the tax rate update you provided today. It just seems like it's a pretty sizable takedown in guidance of $0.05 to $0.10, I'm sorry, at the top line when there's strength elsewhere in the business. I just can't understand maybe how sizable that change was on the dental side in the last month or 2 and what you've been seeing."

And while we're not convinced that this is a long-term permanent impact, we do want to make sure that if it continues for a little while, that our guidance is sustainable. We do have foreign exchange headwinds. We do expect although we haven't seen much impact right now in the U.K., we do expect that the U.K. market will soften. And as you probably know, about 8% of our revenues are in the U.K. market between dental and Animal Health. We also, because I know you know this also, but when you look at profitability, U.S. dental on the distribution business is our most profitable business. So we have a mix issue on profitability, where most profitable business is growing the slowest. And while Medical and Animal Health all nicely profitable, they're just not as profitable. So there's a lot of things going on, Jeff, and we just feel that right now, given that we were not expecting this June sales slowdown, is the time to be a little bit cautious in the market. So hopefully that helps you a little bit."

We did not see a significant rebound in U.S. dental sales in July, consumable sales. It's really right now, continuing at similar rates to Q2.

We do expect an uptick, a modest uptick in consumable sales in the U.S. But again, we're trying to be cautious, and I'd like to point out when you look at our margin, you look at the components of our margin. For the quarter, excluding restructuring costs, our operating expenses are down 35 basis points versus the prior year. And if you exclude the acquisitions in the last 12 months, operating expenses are actually down 55 basis points. So our restructuring activities are making us more efficient. But on the gross margin level, dental consumable sales, the distribution are our highest gross margin business. So again, we're trying to be cautious in looking in the market and a little bit conservative. We need more data points in the future in order to be able to talk about what we're seeing for longer term in the market."

Let me add a little bit more flavor. First of all, there is no IMS data as we said over the past -- in dentistry, but it's our view that essentially from a units point of view, the market is flat, it's not going down. It's not going up,",548,"Thank you, Steven. Let me add a little bit more flavor. First of all, there is no IMS data as we said over the past -- in dentistry, but it's our view that essentially from a units point of view, the market is flat, it's not going down. It's not going up, talking about the U.S. consumable market, and we think that the market is growing at about 2%, which is essentially price increases. We -- there is an independent market data product out there. It's not accurate, but it does show modest sequential downturn, and it is more or less accurate directionally. But 2 months is not a statistically valid view of that market from our point of view. We've also spoken to several key manufacturers who support this view that the consumable business in the U.S. is essentially flat with a couple of 100 basis points of inflation. So we're talking about 100 basis points, 80 basis points margin of error. It's very, very small. And in that context, we believe we are still gaining market share and have gained market share consistently for a while. We hear this from all of the major, most of the major, if not all the major manufacturers. So we want to take a cautious view. I will be quick to say that our demand for equipment is good. One of our key manufacturers was delayed a little bit in the second quarter with providing equipment, a new system which we have taken a lot of orders for. We believe that those -- that equipment will be delivered in time for the third quarter. So we are looking at a much better second quarter. But within these hundreds of basis points, this way, that way, we want to be on the cautious side. I also mentioned earlier on that we are doing quite well with CAD/CAM sales, particularly with scanners. So we have to be careful not to be too negative but also want to be cautious here. And yes, our Medical, our Animal Health, our oral surgery, our dental specialty businesses in general remains solid. In fact, our corporate accounts business, our special markets business in dentistry is actually doing quite well and so is the midmarket. The area that we just can't put our finger on right now is what's happening to the smaller, Main Street dentist in the U.S. And again, overall, we do see that we're gaining market share in this country and abroad  in all of our businesses. We don't see any area on strategic side we want to moderate or change. Perhaps we want to advance the solutions business leading with the software a little bit faster. But overall, I think Steven is right to be on the cautious side, and we want to reduce the top end a bit of our guidance. So it's really cautionary, indicative of these numerous areas that may be slightly questionable, including the economy in this country and in Europe. We are actually quite comfortable that we will deliver good results in the end in Europe, but the economy in Europe is out of our control. So that's why we like to be a little bit more cautious and also control our expenses a little bit more carefully."

And again, we want to be careful about not creating expectations that we're going to report monthly sales on an ongoing basis. But because of this particular situation, I must say caught us a little bit of by surprise heading into our dental national sales meeting in June. It is possible that a little bit of a downtick occurred because our entire sales force was out at the field for a while. But to answer that question directly, May -- April and May were pretty good in the implant business. June was a challenge, but it would appear that July bounced back. But again, John, we're talking within hundreds of basis points both sides, not even 100, 100 or so basis points both sides. So I'm not sure that this was conclusive on the downside or conclusive on the upside. I will say the U.S. implant market is quite strong. We're comfortable with the European markets for implants. But on the margin, our implant business has been driven by a few countries, not on the ground but through distribution agents in countries like Russia and Turkey and even Japan, and we -- these are markets that have been very helpful again driving within 100 basis points here or there growth, but we are a little cautious about these markets. Having said that, let me quickly remind that we're quite comfortable with our 2 big markets for BioHorizons, the U.S., Canada and for Camlog, Germany and the Dutch region."

We saw similar things, and I don't want to draw anymore analogy to what I'm about to say just  a narrow point I'm going to make. Don't read any trends into this. But in 2008, '09 and '10, Animal Health mostly, in most of those quarters, did better than dental, but I don't want to come to any conclusions because there are a lot of other factors in dental, insurance. We have to also remember I think we may have gotten a false positive in the first quarter because our growth was significant on consumables, and that may have been due to weather. I think the dental market in the United States has been more or less flat for a while and driven a little bit by inflation and also perhaps, visits to implant dentists a little bit more. But again, we're in a few hundred basis points here in dental, and it's hard to gauge what is happening specifically within that range. Having said that, the Animal Health market is a healthy market around the world, driven by the middle class and as we said before, many times, the baby boomers. They're buying more pets. Again, I'm not really speaking on behalf of the side of it, the production side, which has its own dynamics related to the mill price, the meat price, but Henry Schein is not a big player in that space with the exception of a few markets like Ireland or New Zealand, where we are in the dairy field and in a couple of markets like Australia and in parts of Europe, where we have some production. But from the pet point of view, it's growing. The demand for pet is growing, and people are spending more money. We've seen that with our customers, both the customer that is public and the customers that are not public. It's a hot space. It's a good space, and I would say the medicals base is good, too, but it's not driven by consumer issues on the Medical side. It's driven by a realignment in the way in which health care is provided. Obviously, we've shown very good results on the Medical side for the past 6 quarters. But obviously, it's not sustainable at that high level although we remain very optimistic in our ability to gain market share. And the foot traffic into the Medical office is not really as important as us gaining bigger account."

So we're looking to do more. Right now, we're still determining exactly what additional restructuring activities should be executed on, and that's why we can't give an estimate for how much the additional restructurings are because we haven't finalized that, but we do expect to take operating expenses down even further, again, to reflect this more cautious view, and there's opportunities there for us, but it's really difficult to pinpoint that at this point."

I think we mentioned the last couple of calls that the sales in Medical, to some extent, is, to a large extent, dependent on bringing on these larger accounts, and they come on board in a lumpy way. So we brought a lot of these accounts",472,"Yes, good, David. I think we mentioned the last couple of calls that the sales in Medical, to some extent, is, to a large extent, dependent on bringing on these larger accounts, and they come on board in a lumpy way. So we brought a lot of these accounts on board in the last 2 years. It's obviously not sustainable at these phenomenal rates because the market is not growing at these rates. The markets probably and there's no specific data is growing by a couple of hundred basis points and definitely not because of inflation, because pricing is moving from branded to generics on the pharmaceutical side and on the MedSurg side. So we've had very healthy growth in this area, organic. We're growing on top of that. So I would repeat what we said in previous calls that we are gaining market share. I think we're gaining very nicely on the market share side organically. Of course, the Cardinal acquisition did help, but organically, I think that's where the impetus is coming, so -- from. So I'm not sure as I said I think in my prepared remarks, that these double-digit growth numbers are sustainable in Medical, but we will grow at a multiple of the market, and we will increase our profits in this area as we drive more profitable mix and products in this area. We're very happy with our Medical business. Now on the of Cardinal side, the integration of the Cardinal Health physician office business is substantially complete, and we have received positive feedback from the acquired customer base. There's a lot of change going on in health care, and we are in the process of modifying our purchase commitment to Cardinal to reflect the rapidly changing environment that makes more business sense from both of our point of view. We're creating greater flexibility in our relationship with Cardinal, specifically around the Integrated Delivery Networks. They are better at servicing aspects of the IDN, and we are better at servicing other aspects of the IDN. So we are modifying the marketing arrangement with Cardinal, and there are certain products that doesn't make sense for us to buy from Cardinal as they have very good procurement pricing as it relates to hospital. But the demand for choice in the physician market is much greater than in the hospital where formularies can be mandated and not for much mandated in the physician space and even in large group practices. So we're modifying this thinking right now with Cardinal, but I would say our internal growth is pretty good in the physician space, arguably the best of all the players, the bigger players, and we are very optimistic about this business, and actually optimistic about the strategic direction we can take this business in over the next 5 years."

However, sales in our Medical, Animal Health, Technology, Value-Added Services businesses were strong as well as in aspects of our North American Dental business, and we will again provide further color on specifics after you had the details from Steven. 
Over the years, our business has been quite predictable. And as an organization, Henry Schein has been able to adapt, seize opportunities and address challenges. We believe that our business model and strategic plan, including our continued investments, will drive our growth over the long term, and in fact, in the medium term, and we remain extremely well-positioned at each of our vertical markets we serve, not only to gain market share, but of course, to manage our investments very carefully. We have a seasoned management team that is very good at these points, and particularly, at gaining market share and managing our investments in a very strategic way. 
On a granular level, looking at plans for the U.K. to leave the European Union, they're on a very early stage and what is -- which is likely to be a 2-year process, many say not much stuff until early next year. Surely, there will be developments along the way, but let me be clear that Henry Schein's commitment to the U.K. remains unchanged, and so does our commitment to the European Union. We continue to believe that the U.K. and Europe on the whole represent attractive long-term opportunities in both our dental and Animal Health businesses and past even in our Medical business in the long term. We expect to continue to execute well in our value-added customer approach just as we did before the Brexit vote. 
In a moment, I'll provide, as I said, additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments, but first, Steven will review the specifics around our financial results."

As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include rest",2078,"Okay, thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include restructuring cost of $20.4 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share. Our prior year Q2 2015 results also include restructuring cost of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. 
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes those restructuring costs, as we believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods, where certain items may vary, independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes, and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see our Exhibit B to this morning's earnings release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
So turning to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 25, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. This consisted of 9.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 7.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.1%. 
Also when further normalizing the switches between agency and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for the company for Q2 was 5.8%. You can see the details of our sales growth also contained in today's earnings news release on Exhibit A. 
If you look at the operating margin on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2016, it was 6.3% and contracted 67 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase in restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year negatively impacted the contraction by 43 basis points. 
Acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, as well as the switches from agency to direct sales, also combined to negatively impact our contraction by 9 basis points. The remaining contraction was primarily driven by lower-than-expected sales growth in our North American Dental business relative to our other businesses. As a result of this, we have extended our restructuring period to the end of 2016 in order to continue to reduce our cost structure. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, our effective tax rate was 27.4%. This compares with an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. 
As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate this quarter reflects approximately $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable proposed tax settlement. We also expect this settlement to reduce our ongoing effective tax rate going forward. More specifically, we anticipate that our effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the 29% range for the remainder of the year, and previously, we had guided that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the 30% range. If we look at net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis, it was $120.1 million or $1.46 per diluted share, representing increases of 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, our adjusted net income attributable to Henry Schein was $135.4 million or $1.64 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 9.9% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. 
Foreign exchange impact on diluted EPS for the quarter was not material. I'd also like to note that at current exchange rates, we expect the foreign exchange translation of our -- outside of the U.S. earnings to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half of the year by at least $0.02 per diluted share, and that's related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound sterling. 
Let me now provide some detail on sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4% to $1.4 billion. This consisted of 4.1% growth in constant currencies and a small 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.3%. Our North American internal growth in constant currencies was 2%, and it included 1.8% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue.  As we noted in our press release, our Q2 dental sales in North America reflect softness that began in early June. Our performance was also impacted by a decision to stop selling certain precious metals products. These products have a very low gross margin, and are relatively immaterial to our profitability. Precious metal sales negatively impacted our North American Dental merchandise sales growth in Q2 by approximately 50 basis points. So again, if you -- our growth would be 50 basis points higher without the decision to stop selling precious metals. 
This will continue to impact our merchandise sales growth until it annualizes. So it will continue for the next 3 quarters. As Stanley mentioned, we are extremely well positioned among our dental customers, and we will continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will drive our growth over the long term. 
Looking at international internal growth in local currencies, our Dental Group was 4.2% growth and included 4.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 3.1% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. That growth internationally was driven specifically by Italy, France and Spain, to a large extent. 
Animal Health sales were $853.6 million in the second quarter. That was an increase of 14%. This included growth of 15.2% in local currencies and a decline of 1.2% related to foreign currency exchange. Our internal sales in local currencies grew 11.8%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 3.4% to our growth. 
Looking at the North American Animal Health sales. Internal sales growth in constant currencies was 18.8%. And when normalizing the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, our growth was 11.4% in North America. We believe this normalized growth rate is more -- is a more meaningful -- sorry, I mean, more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and also reflects the strength of a broader Animal Health market. Our international Animal Health sales growth internally in constant currencies was 4.9%. 
Looking at our Medical Group. Our Medical sales were $538.8 million in the second quarter, and that was an increase of 14.4%. Foreign exchange had virtually no impact on our sales growth. That 14.5% growth included 14.9% growth in North America and 2.4% growth in local currencies internationally. Again, when normalizing for the impact of agency sales in the prior year, North American internal growth was 10.4%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains for our North American Medical business. So indeed, we have been outperforming the Medical market by a fairly significant margin for the past 6 quarters, and we have effectively capitalized in the growing market trend towards larger group practices, including IDNs or integrated delivery networks. 
Our Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $107 million for the quarter, representing a 19.6% growth. This included 20.4% growth in constant currencies and a 0.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated growth was 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 12.3%. The 8.1% internal growth in local currencies included 8.5% growth in North America, and 6.4% growth internationally. I'd like to highlight that our North American sales growth included more than 20% growth in our financial services business.  Our financial services business includes equipment and practice financing, credit card processing, practice brokerage and patient collections, as well as other services. Our core software products and upgrades of Technology and Value-Added Services businesses also aims to provide customers with solutions that are efficient and patient friendly, allowing them to generate more business, manage content among multiple sites and improve the overall practice management. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. More specifically, we purchased 337,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $169.41, and that represented about $57 million. The impact on the current quarter of that purchase was immaterial to our EPS. I think it's important to note at the close of the quarter, we had approximately $243 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock, and we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activity, will continue to provide increased shareholder value. If we look at some brief highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million compared to $207 million in the prior year, and we believe we'll continue to have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding was 40.8 days this quarter compares to 39.3 days last year. Inventory turns for the quarter were 5.6 turns, and that compares to 5.8 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2016 financial guidance. We are revising our guidance due to the impact of a number of factors. These factors include the ongoing business and economic uncertainty related to the Brexit vote, which will have a potential impact on the U.K. as well as the rest of Europe. As noted earlier, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling at current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half by at least $0.02, and this new guidance also includes a cautious view of the North American Dental market. 
So for 2016, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $6.55 to $6.60, which represents growth of 10% to 11% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.96. All of these adjusted diluted EPS numbers exclude restructuring costs, and this compares to our previous guidance, which was $6.55 to $6.65. Our guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only, given that the company cannot reasonably project the restructuring cost that we expect to incur in the second half of 2016. For the same reason, the company is unable to address the probable significance of that information. 
Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations, as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions as well as restructuring costs. We now anticipate that the restructuring initiatives will continue into the second half of the year as we continue to reduce our operating costs in light of some of these market conditions. 
At this time, again, we're not able to provide estimates for this impact in our 2016 financial results. Specifically, for Q3, we expect our growth in adjusted diluted EPS, again excluding restructuring costs, to be in the mid-single-digits. So mid-single-digit growth for Q3, but we obviously expect the growth to accelerate in Q4. This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels as of now. However, we do believe that there's a possibility that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, and remember that 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
Also, I'd like to conclude by mentioning that our fourth quarter results, since we're on a 52-, 53-week basis, ending on the last Saturday of December, include an extra week. So 2016 consists of 53 weeks. The extra week is in Q4 of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], and it's the last week of our fiscal year, which is the holiday week at the end of the year. So sales are typically lower during that week, and we typically don't have the same level of profitability because of fixed costs remaining relatively constant. 
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call over back to Stanley."

We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and o",1769,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with dental. As Steve noted, North America dental sales were impacted by softness in the U.S. that began in early June. We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and our commitment to delivering value to their practices will continue to be key to our long-term success, and as in the past, will enable us to continue to gain market share, not only in the United States, but globally in the dental market. Although the sales growth was lower than expected in the second quarter, we believe we have a proven and successful model of delivering value-added solutions to our customers, and we have increased our focus on delivering on better sales results in the short term. As evidence of this commitment, during our second quarter, we announced an investment in Custom Automated Prosthetics, known as CAP. CAP is a U.S. digital laboratory supply company with 2015 sales of approximately $30 million. They offer CAD/CAM equipment as well as a full line of zirconia materials. The integration of CAP with Zahn, which is our dental laboratory business, and our Custom Milling Center furthers our commitment to providing dental laboratory customers with a greater selection of digital equipment, materials and services. We believe these products will help them, our laboratory customers, to navigate through the important digital transition that is occurring in the dental technology space today and I might add, at a rapid pace. 
Further supporting our commitment to advanced technology and to help prepare the next generation of dental professionals for advances in digital dentistry, in May, we announced the opening of the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Kornberg School of Dentistry. Technology advancements are affecting almost every aspect of the practice of dentistry, and we are committed not only to bringing those advancements to our customers, but also to making sure our current and future customers are well-versed in all aspects of running an efficient and profitable practice, while allowing for high-quality patient care.  Dental students and faculty at Temple University now have access to the latest 3D imaging equipment, intraoral scanners and milling machines made available as a result of this partnership. 
Regarding our dental -- digital -- regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we continue to see strong growth in sales of digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. The breadth of our product offering is reflected -- is reflective of our belief that customers want choice and open architecture for their restorative dentistry needs. This also creates opportunity for follow-on software and mill sales when these dental practices are ready to move to full scale in our systems. With Zahn Dental and CAP, we continue to be well positioned to provide innovative solutions to the lab market for restorations that are outsourced from the practice. Let me just add that in North America, CAD/CAM sales were strong in the second quarter, driven by digital scanner sales, while our traditional sales for -- traditional equipment sales were soft, and I might add, partially due to timing. 
Lastly, I'd like to comment on a recent change in our Global Dental surgical group. As of June, BioHorizons has become the exclusive distributor of CAMLOG-branded products in the United States and Canada. This creates a unified sales force in the U.S. for complete dental offerings to specialists and general practitioners. By combining the 2 sales forces for these high-quality, complementary brands, we are creating a more efficient go-to-market strategy, giving our customers access to a greater selection of products and services from high-quality branded to high-quality economy implants with a wide variety of clinical-based products. It also will afford more robust North American coverage and strengthening our position to effectively compete and grow our market share in, as I said, the premium and the value-added segments of the dental implant market. We look forward to continued success in this important segment. These businesses are and actually have been doing quite well for a while. 
Now let me turn and of course, happy to answer more questions on the dental side during the rest of the call. On the Animal Health side, as Steven mentioned, when normalizing for Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.4% in North America, reflective of a healthy market, but also reflective of market share gains. We have been gaining market share in North America in the Animal Health arena for a while now. International currencies sales during the second quarter were up 12%, with organic growth complemented by acquisition growth. We are making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio, targeting practices that are nearing end of the instrument lease agreements, as well as growing clinics with a need for multiple systems for high-volume testing. Indeed, sales of diagnostic products in North America grew in the low double digits in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. We believe this is ahead of the market growth in this sector. 
Axis-Q continues to be an attractive element of our sales proposals as customers are strong benefits and efficiency -- see strong benefits and efficiently linking their Practice Management Software with their diagnostic instruments. This is a holistic approach. It's not selling devices nor is it selling software. It's the interoperability of devices and software connected to the Practice Management system, the clinical workstation. 
As a reminder, Henry Schein's Practice Management Software is today used by more than 50% of the U.S. veterinary practices. Again, strategy here in the Animal Health space is doing very well, well thought out and being well-executed, of course, not only in the U.S. but throughout the world in the Animal Health arena, where Henry Schein is, in fact, active. 
Let me now turn to Medical. The reported growth in our Medical Group of 14.5% was impacted by agency sales in the prior year. When normalizing for this impact, the core internal growth for North America Medical was 10.4% as Steven mentioned. And let me stress, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains. We continue to see solid growth from large group practices, including IDNs, the Integrated Delivery Networks, as we onboard new customer wins from the past year. These are internal growth wins that we've been working on for a while and that are bearing fruit. 
In addition, the expansion of large health systems, with which we have built strong relationships over the past several years, is contributing to our growth. Our focus on the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market is yielding solid results as well, as we are seeing strong sales in this sector, and our teams are making inroads with our smaller market segments, including universities and sports medicine. So we have a growing base of customers who rely on our broad, Value-Added Services model. 
Now let me talk about the Technology and Value-Added Services group. We are pleased again with the second quarter performance of this business group. North American Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 8.5% in local currencies, matched the highest growth rate in more than 3 years. Strategic acquisitions have bolstered our market share in this business, as sales in local currencies increased by more than 21% in North America during the second quarter by nearly 15% internationally. Of course, we are very pleased with these results, as reported to the P&Ls of these businesses. But let me remind our investors that, in fact, it's the stickiness, the Value-Added Services, that our practice solutions group brings to bear in our customer base that has the real strategic value. Enhancing digital platforms across the businesses we serve is an important priority for Henry Schein, in fact, one of our largest and perhaps most important priorities. We provide a means for our customers to better connect with their patients and improve overall efficiency, thereby, reinforcing our value to their practices, and in fact, allowing our customers to show their value to their patients. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to drive interoperability with devices and of course, the cloud to manage workflows. 
We are very, very pleased with the progress we made specifically on our cloud-based dental product and the connection between our Practice Management Software and the devices in the dental space, whether it is in the imaging area or in the prosthetics area. Likewise, as I reported earlier on, in the Animal Health space with our diagnostic and imaging product offerings that are connected so well to our Practice Management Software, which will only get better over time. 
So as you may know, 2015 was a special year for Henry Schein as we mark 20 years as a publicly traded company. In May, we had the opportunity to celebrate this milestone as we opened trading at the NASDAQ stock market. 20 years ago, we had a vision for what Henry Schein could become. Since then, more and more people have joined us in sharing that vision in building our company and expanding our presence in the global markets we serve, and all the while, we have demonstrated we can successfully serve shareholders, while also serving society, and of course, our suppliers and our customers and the team. We are pleased to have accomplished so much as a result of the hard work of Team Schein Members across the globe over the past 2 -- 20 years since we've been public. 
We continue to be most optimistic about our strategies. We are unwavering in executing our strategic plan, which revolves around the notion of helping practitioners operate a more efficient practice while providing better clinical care. We feel that we have the right strategies and the tactics in place, and we'll, of course, make sure that we manage our expenses in a way that delivers on our commitments to our shareholders.  Lastly, we are pleased to announce that in June, Henry Schein moved up to #268 in the ranking of the Fortune 500, celebrating our 13th year as one of America's largest corporations. This is testament to more than 19,000 Team Schein Members throughout the world, who are dedicated to helping our customers build better practices, so they can provide better quality care. We, of course, have been on the list of the Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the entire period. 
So with that commentary and an overview of our quarterly results from both a financial and operating performance point of view, thank you for your attention, and we're, of course, ready to answer any questions that shareholders may have."

Dental, soft. But if I back out that a little bit of precious metals, consumables still growing north of 2%, so no big disaster there. But Steve, when I look at your guidance, you're taking it down $0.05 at the top, another $0.05 if I adjust for the tax rate update you provided today. It just seems like it's a pretty sizable takedown in guidance of $0.05 to $0.10, I'm sorry, at the top line when there's strength elsewhere in the business. And I just can't understand maybe how sizable that change was on the dental side in the last month or 2, and what you've been seeing."

As we said, in the U.S. dental, we saw slowness of sales that began in June. And while we're not convinced that this is a long-term permanent impact, we do want to make sure that if it continues for a little while, that our guidance is sustainable. We do have foreign exchange headwinds. We do expect, although we haven't seen much impact right now in the U.K., we do expect that the U.K. market will soften. And as you probably know, about 8% of our revenues are in the U.K. market between dental and Animal Health. We also, because I know you know this also, but when you look at profitability, U.S. dental on the distribution business is our most profitable business. So we have a mix issue on profitability, where most profitable business is growing the slowest. And while Medical and Animal Health are nicely profitable. They're just not as profitable. So there's a lot of things going on, Jeff, and we just feel that, right now, given that we were not expecting this June sales slowdown, is the time to be a little bit cautious in the market. So hopefully that helps you a little bit."

On the other hand, equipment, we did see a increase in equipment demand. Our backlog is very strong and increasing on equipment. We do expect an uptick, a modest uptick in consumable sales in the U.S. But again, we're trying to be cautious, and I'd like to point out when you look at our margin, look at the components of our margin, for the quarter, excluding restructuring costs, our operating expenses are down 35 basis points versus the prior year. And if you exclude the acquisitions in the last 12 months, operating expenses are actually down 55 basis points. So our restructuring activities are making us more efficient. But on the gross margin level, dental consumable sales, the distribution are our highest gross margin business. So again, we're trying to be cautious in the market and a little bit conservative. And so we need more data points in the future in order to be able to talk about what we're seeing for longer term in the market."

First of all, there is no IMS data, as we said, over the past -- in dentistry, but it's our view that essentially from a units point of view, the market is flat. It's not going down. It's not going up, talking about the U.S. consumable market, and we think that the market is growing at about 2%, which is essentially price increases. We -- there is an independent market data product out there. It's not accurate, but it does show modest sequential downturn, and it is more or less accurate directionally, but 2 months is not a statistically valid view of that market from our point of view. We've also spoken to several key manufacturers who support this view that the consumable business in the U.S. is essentially flat with a couple of 100 basis points of inflation. So we're talking about 100 basis points, 80 basis points margin of error. It's very, very small. And in that context, we believe we are still gaining market share and have gained market share consistently for a while. We hear this from all of the major, most of the major, if not, all of the major manufacturers. So we want to take a cautious view. I will be quick to say that our demand for equipment is good. One of our key manufacturers was delayed a little bit in the second quarter with providing equipment, a new system which we have taken a lot of orders for. We believe that those -- that equipment will be delivered in time for the fixed third quarter. So we are looking at a much better second quarter. But within these hundreds of basis points, this way, that way, we want to be on the cautious side. I also mentioned earlier on that we are doing quite well with CAD/CAM sales, particularly with scanners. So we have to be careful not to be too negative, but also want to be cautious here. And yes, our Medical, our Animal Health, our oral surgery, our dental specialty businesses, in general, remains solid. In fact, our corporate accounts business, our special markets business in dentistry is actually doing quite well and so is the mid-market. The area what we just can't put our finger on right now is what's happening to the smaller, Main Street dentist in the U.S. And again, overall, we do see that we are gaining market share in this country and abroad in all of our businesses. We don't see any area on the strategic side we want to moderate or change. Perhaps, we want to advance the solutions business, leading with software a little bit faster. But overall, I think Steven is right to be on the cautious side, and we want to reduce the top end a bit of our guidance. So it's really cautionary, indicative of these numerous areas that may be slightly questionable, including the economy in this country and in Europe. We're actually quite comfortable that we will deliver good results in the end in Europe, but the economy in Europe is out of our control. So that's why we'd like to be a little bit more cautious and also control our expenses a little bit more carefully."

And again, we want to be careful about not creating expectations that we're going to report monthly sales on an ongoing basis. But because of this particular situation, it caught -- I must say, it caught us a little bit by surprise heading into our dental national sales meeting in June. It is possible that a little bit of a downtick occurred because our entire sales force was out at the field for a while. But to answer the question directly, May -- April and May were pretty good in the implant business. June was a challenge, but it would appear that July bounced back. But again, John, we're talking within hundreds of basis points both sides, not even 100, 100 or so basis points both sides. So I'm not sure if this was conclusive on the downside or conclusive on the upside. I will say the U.S. implant market is quite strong. We're comfortable with the European markets for implants. But on the margin, our implant business has been driven by a few countries, not by Henry Schein on the ground but through distribution agents in countries like Russia and Turkey and even Japan, and -- these are markets that have been very helpful, again, driving within 100 basis points here or there growth, but we're a little cautious about these markets.

We saw similar things, and I don't want to draw anymore analogy to what I'm about to say than just a narrow point I'm going to make. Don't read any trends into this. But in 2008, '09 and '10, Animal Health mostly, in most of those quarters, did better than dental, but I don't want to come to any conclusions because there are a lot of other factors in dental, insurance. We have to also remember, I think we may have gotten a false positive in the first quarter because our growth was significant on consumables, and that may have been due to weather. I think the dental market in the United States has been more or less flat for a while and driven a little bit by inflation, and also, perhaps, visits to implant dentists a little bit more. But again, we're in a few hundred basis points here in dental, and it's hard to gauge what is happening specifically within that range. Having said that, the Animal Health market is a healthy market around the world, driven by the middle class, and as we've said before, many times, the baby boomers. They're buying more pets. Again, I'm not really speaking on behalf of the agri side of it, the production side, which has its own dynamics related to the mill price, the meat price, but Henry Schein is not a big player in that space with exception of a few markets like Ireland or New Zealand, where we are in the dairy field and in a couple of markets Australia and in parts of Europe, where we have some production. But from the pet point of view, it's growing. The demand for pet is growing, and people are spending more money. We've seen that with our customers, both the customer that is public and the customers that are not public. It's a hot space. It's a good space, and I would say the medical space is good too, but it's not driven by consumer issues on the Medical side. It's driven by a realignment in the way in which health care is provided. Obviously, we've shown very good results on the Medical side for the past 6 quarters. But obviously, it's not sustainable at that high level, although we remain very optimistic in our ability to gain market share. And the foot traffic into the Medical office is not really as important as us gaining bigger account."

There's also restructuring, further restructuring activities, which will only have a modest impact in Q3 and have a greater impact in Q4. And lastly, a potential for flu vaccine sales timing that could be a little bit negative for us. So -- but the biggest reason because I gave you a laundry list, but the biggest reason is that 15.7% EPS growth last year's third quarter."

I think we've mentioned the last couple of calls that the sales in Medical, in some extent, is to a large extent, dependent on bringing on these larger accounts, and they come on board in a lumpy way. So we've brought a lot of these accounts onboard in the last 2 years. It's obviously not sustainable at these phenomenal rates because the market is not growing above these rates. The markets probably, and there's no specific data, is growing by a couple of hundred basis points and definitely not because of inflation, because pricing is moving from branded to generics on the pharmaceutical side and on the med surg side. So we've had very healthy growth in this area, organic. We're growing on top of that. So I would repeat what we've said in previous calls that we are gaining market share. I think we're gaining very nicely on the market share side organically. Of course, the Cardinal acquisition did help, but organically, I think that's where the impetus is coming, so -- from. So I'm not sure as I said, I think, in my -- I think in the prepared remarks, that these double-digit growth numbers are sustainable in Medical, but we will grow at a multiple of the market, and we will increase our profits in this area, as we drive more profitable mix and products in this area. We're very happy with our Medical business. Now on Cardinal side, the integration of the Cardinal Health physician office business is substantially complete, and we have received positive feedback from the acquired customer base. There's a lot of change going on in health care, and we are in the process of modifying our purchase commitment to Cardinal to reflect the rapidly changing environment that makes more business sense from both of our point of view. We're creating greater flexibility in our relationship with Cardinal, specifically around the Integrated Delivery Networks. They are better at servicing aspects of the IDN, and we are better at servicing other aspects of the IDN. So we are modifying the marketing arrangement with Cardinal, and there are certain products that doesn't make sense for us to buy from Cardinal, as they have very good procurement pricing as it relates to hospitals. But the demand for choice in the physician market is much greater than in the hospital where formularies can be mandated, and not so much mandated in the physician space and even in large group practices. So we're modifying this thinking right now with Cardinal, but I would say our internal growth is pretty good in the physician space, arguably, the best of all the players, the bigger players, and we are very optimistic about this business, and actually optimistic about the strategic direction we can take this business in over the next 5 years."

However, sales in our Medical, Animal Health, Technology, Value-Added Services businesses were strong as well as in aspects of our North American Dental business, and we will again provide further color on specifics after you had the details from Steven. 
Over the years, our business has been quite predictable. And as an organization, Henry Schein has been able to adapt, seize opportunities and address challenges. We believe that our business model and strategic plan, including our continued investments, will drive our growth over the long term, and in fact, in the medium term, and we remain extremely well-positioned at each of our vertical markets we serve, not only to gain market share, but of course, to manage our investments very carefully. We have a seasoned management team that is very good at these points, and particularly, at gaining market share and managing our investments in a very strategic way. 
On a granular level, looking at plans for the U.K. to leave the European Union, they're on a very early stage and what is -- which is likely to be a 2-year process, many say not much starts until early next year. Surely, there will be developments along the way, but let me be clear that Henry Schein's commitment to the U.K. remains unchanged, and so does our commitment to the European Union. We continue to believe that the U.K. and Europe on the whole represent attractive long-term opportunities in both our dental and Animal Health businesses and past even in our Medical business in the long term. We expect to continue to execute well in our value-added customer approach just as we did before the Brexit vote. 
In a moment, I'll provide, as I said, additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments, but first, Steven will review the specifics around our financial results."

As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include rest",2078,"Okay, thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include restructuring cost of $20.4 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share. Our prior year Q2 2015 results also include restructuring cost of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. 
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes those restructuring costs, as we believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods, where certain items may vary, independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes, and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see our Exhibit B to this morning's earnings release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
So turning to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 25, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. This consisted of 9.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 7.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.1%. 
Also when further normalizing the switches between agency and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for the company for Q2 was 5.8%. You can see the details of our sales growth also contained in today's earnings news release on Exhibit A. 
If you look at the operating margin on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2016, it was 6.3% and contracted 67 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase in restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year negatively impacted the contraction by 43 basis points. 
Acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, as well as the switches from agency to direct sales, also combined to negatively impact our contraction by 9 basis points. The remaining contraction was primarily driven by lower-than-expected sales growth in our North American Dental business relative to our other businesses. As a result of this, we have extended our restructuring period to the end of 2016 in order to continue to reduce our cost structure. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, our effective tax rate was 27.4%. This compares with an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. 
As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate this quarter reflects approximately $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable proposed tax settlement. We also expect this settlement to reduce our ongoing effective tax rate going forward. More specifically, we anticipate that our effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the 29% range for the remainder of the year, and previously, we had guided that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the 30% range. If we look at net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis, it was $120.1 million or $1.46 per diluted share, representing increases of 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, our adjusted net income attributable to Henry Schein was $135.4 million or $1.64 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 9.9% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. 
Foreign exchange impact on diluted EPS for the quarter was not material. I'd also like to note that at current exchange rates, we expect the foreign exchange translation of our -- outside of the U.S. earnings to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half of the year by at least $0.02 per diluted share, and that's related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound sterling. 
Let me now provide some detail on sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4% to $1.4 billion. This consisted of 4.1% growth in constant currencies and a small 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.3%. Our North American internal growth in constant currencies was 2%, and it included 1.8% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue.  As we noted in our press release, our Q2 dental sales in North America reflect softness that began in early June. Our performance was also impacted by a decision to stop selling certain precious metals products. These products have a very low gross margin, and are relatively immaterial to our profitability. Precious metal sales negatively impacted our North American Dental merchandise sales growth in Q2 by approximately 50 basis points. So again, if you -- our growth would be 50 basis points higher without the decision to stop selling precious metals. 
This will continue to impact our merchandise sales growth until it annualizes. So it will continue for the next 3 quarters. As Stanley mentioned, we are extremely well positioned among our dental customers, and we will continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will drive our growth over the long term. 
Looking at international internal growth in local currencies, our Dental Group was 4.2% growth and included 4.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 3.1% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. That growth internationally was driven specifically by Italy, France and Spain, to a large extent. 
Animal Health sales were $853.6 million in the second quarter. That was an increase of 14%. This included growth of 15.2% in local currencies and a decline of 1.2% related to foreign currency exchange. Our internal sales in local currencies grew 11.8%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 3.4% to our growth. 
Looking at the North American Animal Health sales. Internal sales growth in constant currencies was 18.8%. And when normalizing the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, our growth was 11.4% in North America. We believe this normalized growth rate is more -- is a more meaningful -- sorry, I mean, more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and also reflects the strength of a broader Animal Health market. Our international Animal Health sales growth internally in constant currencies was 4.9%. 
Looking at our Medical Group. Our Medical sales were $538.8 million in the second quarter, and that was an increase of 14.4%. Foreign exchange had virtually no impact on our sales growth. That 14.5% growth included 14.9% growth in North America and 2.4% growth in local currencies internationally. Again, when normalizing for the impact of agency sales in the prior year, North American internal growth was 10.4%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains for our North American Medical business. So indeed, we have been outperforming the Medical market by a fairly significant margin for the past 6 quarters, and we have effectively capitalized in the growing market trend towards larger group practices, including IDNs or integrated delivery networks. 
Our Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $107 million for the quarter, representing a 19.6% growth. This included 20.4% growth in constant currencies and a 0.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated growth was 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 12.3%. The 8.1% internal growth in local currencies included 8.5% growth in North America, and 6.4% growth internationally. I'd like to highlight that our North American sales growth included more than 20% growth in our financial services business.  Our financial services business includes equipment and practice financing, credit card processing, practice brokerage and patient collections, as well as other services. Our core software products and upgrades of Technology and Value-Added Services businesses also aims to provide customers with solutions that are efficient and patient friendly, allowing them to generate more business, manage content among multiple sites and improve the overall practice management. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. More specifically, we purchased 337,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $169.41, and that represented about $57 million. The impact on the current quarter of that purchase was immaterial to our EPS. I think it's important to note at the close of the quarter, we had approximately $243 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock, and we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activity, will continue to drive increased shareholder value. If we look at some brief highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million compared to $207 million in the prior year, and we believe we'll continue to have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding was 40.8 days this quarter compares to 39.3 days last year. Inventory turns for the quarter were 5.6 turns, and that compares to 5.8 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2016 financial guidance. We are revising our guidance due to the impact of a number of factors. These factors include the ongoing business and economic uncertainty related to the Brexit vote, which will have a potential impact on the U.K. as well as the rest of Europe. As noted earlier, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling at current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half by at least $0.02, and this new guidance also includes a cautious view of the North American Dental market. 
So for 2016, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $6.55 to $6.60, which represents growth of 10% to 11% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.96. All of these adjusted diluted EPS numbers exclude restructuring costs, and this compares to our previous guidance, which was $6.55 to $6.65. Our guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only, given that the company cannot reasonably project the restructuring cost that we expect to incur in the second half of 2016. For the same reason, the company is unable to address the probable significance of that information. 
Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations, as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions as well as restructuring costs. We now anticipate that the restructuring initiatives will continue into the second half of the year as we continue to reduce our operating costs in light of some of these market conditions. 
At this time, again, we're not able to provide estimates for this impact in our 2016 financial results. Specifically, for Q3, we expect our growth in adjusted diluted EPS, again excluding restructuring costs, to be in the mid-single-digits. So mid-single-digit growth for Q3, but we obviously expect the growth to accelerate in Q4. This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels as of now. However, we do believe that there's a possibility that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, and remember that 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
Also, I'd like to conclude by mentioning that our fourth quarter results, since we're on a 52-, 53-week basis, ending on the last Saturday of December, include an extra week. So 2016 consists of 53 weeks. The extra week is in Q4 of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], and it's the last week of our fiscal year, which is the holiday week at the end of the year. So sales are typically lower during that week, and we typically don't have the same level of profitability because of fixed costs remaining relatively constant. 
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call over back to Stanley."

We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and o",1769,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with dental. As Steve noted, North America dental sales were impacted by softness in the U.S. that began in early June. We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and our commitment to delivering value to their practices will continue to be key to our long-term success, and as in the past, will enable us to continue to gain market share, not only in the United States, but globally in the dental market. Although the sales growth was lower than expected in the second quarter, we believe we have a proven and successful model of delivering value-added solutions to our customers, and we have increased our focus on delivering on better sales results in the short term. As evidence of this commitment, during our second quarter, we announced an investment in Custom Automated Prosthetics, known as CAP. CAP is a U.S. digital laboratory supply company with 2015 sales of approximately $30 million. They offer CAD/CAM equipment as well as a full line of zirconia materials. The integration of CAP with Zahn, which is our dental laboratory business, and our Custom Milling Center furthers our commitment to providing dental laboratory customers with a greater selection of digital equipment, materials and services. We believe these products will help them, our laboratory customers, to navigate through the important digital transition that is occurring in the dental technology space today and I might add, at a rapid pace. 
Further supporting our commitment to advanced technology and to help prepare the next generation of dental professionals for advances in digital dentistry, in May, we announced the opening of the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Kornberg School of Dentistry. Technology advancements are affecting almost every aspect of the practice of dentistry, and we are committed not only to bringing those advancements to our customers, but also to making sure our current and future customers are well-versed in all aspects of running an efficient and profitable practice, while allowing for high-quality patient care.  Dental students and faculty at Temple University now have access to the latest 3D imaging equipment, intraoral scanners and milling machines made available as a result of this partnership. 
Regarding our dental -- digital -- regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we continue to see strong growth in sales of digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. The breadth of our product offering is reflected -- is reflective of our belief that customers want choice and open architecture for their restorative dentistry needs. This also creates opportunity for follow-on software and mill sales when these dental practices are ready to move to full scale in our systems. With Zahn Dental and CAP, we continue to be well positioned to provide innovative solutions to the lab market for restorations that are outsourced from the practice. Let me just add that in North America, CAD/CAM sales were strong in the second quarter, driven by digital scanner sales, while our traditional sales for -- traditional equipment sales were soft, and I might add, partially due to timing. 
Lastly, I'd like to comment on a recent change in our Global Dental surgical group. As of June, BioHorizons has become the exclusive distributor of CAMLOG-branded products in the United States and Canada. This creates a unified sales force in the U.S. for complete dental offerings to specialists and general practitioners. By combining the 2 sales forces for these high-quality, complementary brands, we are creating a more efficient go-to-market strategy, giving our customers access to a greater selection of products and services from high-quality branded to high-quality economy implants with a wide variety of clinical-based products. It also will afford more robust North American coverage and strengthening our position to effectively compete and grow our market share in, as I said, the premium and the value-added segments of the dental implant market. We look forward to continued success in this important segment. These businesses are and actually have been doing quite well for a while. 
Now let me turn and of course, happy to answer more questions on the dental side during the rest of the call. On the Animal Health side, as Steven mentioned, when normalizing for Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.4% in North America, reflective of a healthy market, but also reflective of market share gains. We have been gaining market share in North America in the Animal Health arena for a while now. International currencies sales during the second quarter were up 12%, with organic growth complemented by acquisition growth. We are making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio, targeting practices that are nearing end of the instrument lease agreements, as well as growing clinics with a need for multiple systems for high-volume testing. Indeed, sales of diagnostic products in North America grew in the low double digits in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. We believe this is ahead of the market growth in this sector. 
Axis-Q continues to be an attractive element of our sales proposals as customers are strong benefits and efficiency -- see strong benefits in efficiently linking their Practice Management Software with their diagnostic instruments. This is a holistic approach. It's not selling devices nor is it selling software. It's the interoperability of devices and software connected to the Practice Management system, the clinical workstation. 
As a reminder, Henry Schein's Practice Management Software is today used by more than 50% of the U.S. veterinary practices. Again, strategy here in the Animal Health space is doing very well, well thought out and being well-executed, of course, not only in the U.S. but throughout the world in the Animal Health arena, where Henry Schein is, in fact, active. 
Let me now turn to Medical. The reported growth in our Medical Group of 14.5% was impacted by agency sales in the prior year. When normalizing for this impact, the core internal growth for North America Medical was 10.4% as Steven mentioned. And let me stress, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains. We continue to see solid growth from large group practices, including IDNs, the Integrated Delivery Networks, as we onboard new customer wins from the past year. These are internal growth wins that we've been working on for a while and that are bearing fruit. 
In addition, the expansion of large health systems, with which we have built strong relationships over the past several years, is contributing to our growth. Our focus on the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market is yielding solid results as well, as we are seeing strong sales in this sector, and our teams are making inroads with our smaller market segments, including universities and sports medicine. So we have a growing base of customers who rely on our broad, Value-Added Services model. 
Now let me talk about the Technology and Value-Added Services group. We are pleased again with the second quarter performance of this business group. North American Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 8.5% in local currencies, matched the highest growth rate in more than 3 years. Strategic acquisitions have bolstered our market share in this business, as sales in local currencies increased by more than 21% in North America during the second quarter by nearly 15% internationally. Of course, we are very pleased with these results, as reported to the P&Ls of these businesses. But let me remind our investors that, in fact, it's the stickiness, the Value-Added Services, that our practice solutions group brings to bear in our customer base that has the real strategic value. Enhancing digital platforms across the businesses we serve is an important priority for Henry Schein, in fact, one of our largest and perhaps most important priorities. We provide a means for our customers to better connect with their patients and improve overall efficiency, thereby, reinforcing our value to their practices, and in fact, allowing our customers to show their value to their patients. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to drive interoperability with devices and of course, the cloud to manage workflows. 
We are very, very pleased with the progress we made specifically on our cloud-based dental product and the connection between our Practice Management Software and the devices in the dental space, whether it is in the imaging area or in the prosthetics area. Likewise, as I reported earlier on, in the Animal Health space with our diagnostic and imaging product offerings that are connected so well to our Practice Management Software, which will only get better over time. 
So as you may know, 2015 was a special year for Henry Schein as we mark 20 years as a publicly traded company. In May, we had the opportunity to celebrate this milestone as we opened trading at the NASDAQ stock market. 20 years ago, we had a vision for what Henry Schein could become. Since then, more and more people have joined us in sharing that vision in building our company and expanding our presence in the global markets we serve, and all the while, we have demonstrated we can successfully serve shareholders, while also serving society, and of course, our suppliers and our customers and the team. We are pleased to have accomplished so much as a result of the hard work of Team Schein Members across the globe over the past 2 -- 20 years since we've been public. 
We continue to be most optimistic about our strategies. We are unwavering in executing our strategic plan, which revolves around the notion of helping practitioners operate a more efficient practice while providing better clinical care. We feel that we have the right strategies and the tactics in place, and we'll, of course, make sure that we manage our expenses in a way that delivers on our commitments to our shareholders.  Lastly, we are pleased to announce that in June, Henry Schein moved up to #268 in the ranking of the Fortune 500, celebrating our 13th year as one of America's largest corporations. This is testament to more than 19,000 Team Schein Members throughout the world, who are dedicated to helping our customers build better practices, so they can provide better quality care. We, of course, have been on the list of the Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the entire period. 
So with that commentary and an overview of our quarterly results from both a financial and operating performance point of view, thank you for your attention, and we're, of course, ready to answer any questions that shareholders may have."

Dental, soft. But if I back out that a little bit of precious metals, consumables still growing north of 2%, so no big disaster there. But Steve, when I look at your guidance, you're taking it down $0.05 at the top, another $0.05 if I adjust for the tax rate update you provided today. It just seems like it's a pretty sizable takedown in guidance of $0.05 to $0.10, I'm sorry, at the top line when there's strength elsewhere in the business. And I just can't understand maybe how sizable that change was on the dental side in the last month or 2, and what you've been seeing."

As we said, in the U.S. dental, we saw slowness of sales that began in June. And while we're not convinced that this is a long-term permanent impact, we do want to make sure that if it continues for a little while, that our guidance is sustainable. We do have foreign exchange headwinds. We do expect, although we haven't seen much impact right now in the U.K., we do expect that the U.K. market will soften. And as you probably know, about 8% of our revenues are in the U.K. market between dental and Animal Health. We also, because I know you know this also, but when you look at profitability, U.S. dental on the distribution business is our most profitable business. So we have a mix issue on profitability, where most profitable business is growing the slowest. And while Medical and Animal Health are nicely profitable. They're just not as profitable. So there's a lot of things going on, Jeff, and we just feel that, right now, given that we were not expecting this June sales slowdown, is the time to be a little bit cautious in the market. So hopefully that helps you a little bit."

We do expect an uptick, a modest uptick in consumable sales in the U.S. But again, we're trying to be cautious, and I'd like to point out when you look at our margin, look at the components of our margin, for the quarter, excluding restructuring costs, our operating expenses are down 35 basis points versus the prior year. And if you exclude the acquisitions in the last 12 months, operating expenses are actually down 55 basis points. So our restructuring activities are making us more efficient. But on the gross margin level, dental consumable sales, the distribution are our highest gross margin business. So again, we're trying to be cautious in the market and a little bit conservative. And so we need more data points in the future in order to be able to talk about what we're seeing for longer term in the market."

Let me just add a little bit more flavor.

First of all, there is no IMS data, as we said, over the past -- in dentistry, but it's our view that essentially from a units point of view, the market is flat. It's not going down. It's not going up, talking about the U.S. consumable market, and we think that the market is growing at about 2%, which is essentially price increases. We -- there is an independent market data product out there. It's not accurate, but it does show modest sequential downturn, and it is more or less accurate directionally, but 2 months is not a statistically valid view of that market from our point of view. We've also spoken to several key manufacturers who support this view that the consumable business in the U.S. is essentially flat with a couple of 100 basis points of inflation. So we're talking about 100 basis points, 80 basis points margin of error. It's very, very small. And in that context, we believe we are still gaining market share and have gained market share consistently for a while. We hear this from all of the major, most of the major, if not, all of the major manufacturers. So we want to take a cautious view. I will be quick to say that our demand for equipment is good. One of our key manufacturers was delayed a little bit in the second quarter with providing equipment, a new system which we have taken a lot of orders for. We believe that those -- that equipment will be delivered in time for the fixed third quarter. So we are looking at a much better second quarter. But within these hundreds of basis points, this way, that way, we want to be on the cautious side. I also mentioned earlier on that we are doing quite well with CAD/CAM sales, particularly with scanners. So we have to be careful not to be too negative, but also want to be cautious here. And yes, our Medical, our Animal Health, our oral surgery, our dental specialty businesses, in general, remains solid. In fact, our corporate accounts business, our special markets business in dentistry is actually doing quite well and so is the mid-market. The area what we just can't put our finger on right now is what's happening to the smaller, Main Street dentist in the U.S. And again, overall, we do see that we are gaining market share in this country and abroad in all of our businesses. We don't see any area on the strategic side we want to moderate or change. Perhaps, we want to advance the solutions business, leading with software a little bit faster. But overall, I think Steven is right to be on the cautious side, and we want to reduce the top end a bit of our guidance. So it's really cautionary, indicative of these numerous areas that may be slightly questionable, including the economy in this country and in Europe. We're actually quite comfortable that we will deliver good results in the end in Europe, but the economy in Europe is out of our control. So that's why we'd like to be a little bit more cautious and also control our expenses a little bit more carefully."

It is possible that a little bit of a downtick occurred because our entire sales force was out at the field for a while. But to answer the question directly, May -- April and May were pretty good in the implant business. June was a challenge, but it would appear that July bounced back. But again, John, we're talking within hundreds of basis points both sides, not even 100, 100 or so basis points both sides. So I'm not sure if this was conclusive on the downside or conclusive on the upside. I will say the U.S. implant market is quite strong. We're comfortable with the European markets for implants. But on the margin, our implant business has been driven by a few countries, not by Henry Schein on the ground but through distribution agents in countries like Russia and Turkey and even Japan, and -- these are markets that have been very helpful, again, driving within 100 basis points here or there growth, but we're a little cautious about these markets.

And again, I'm talking about consumables because I think the equipment business is quite sound, especially in the digital space, whether it is digital imaging or digital prosthetics."

Yes, we are doing better than the market, both here and in Europe, but it is doing well. It's alive and well. We saw similar things, and I don't want to draw anymore analogy to what I'm about to say than just a narrow point I'm going to make. Don't read any trends into this. But in 2008, '09 and '10, Animal Health mostly, in most of those quarters, did better than dental, but I don't want to come to any conclusions because there are a lot of other factors in dental, insurance. We have to also remember, I think we may have gotten a false positive in the first quarter because our growth was significant on consumables, and that may have been due to weather. I think the dental market in the United States has been more or less flat for a while and driven a little bit by inflation, and also, perhaps, visits to implant dentists a little bit more. But again, we're in a few hundred basis points here in dental, and it's hard to gauge what is happening specifically within that range. Having said that, the Animal Health market is a healthy market around the world, driven by the middle class, and as we've said before, many times, the baby boomers. They're buying more pets. Again, I'm not really speaking on behalf of the agri side of it, the production side, which has its own dynamics related to the milk price, the meat price, but Henry Schein is not a big player in that space with exception of a few markets like Ireland or New Zealand, where we are in the dairy field and in a couple of markets Australia and in parts of Europe, where we have some production. But from the pet point of view, it's growing. The demand for pets is growing, and people are spending more money. We've seen that with our customers, both the customer that is public and the customers that are not public. It's a hot space. It's a good space, and I would say the medical space is good too, but it's not driven by consumer issues on the Medical side. It's driven by a realignment in the way in which health care is provided. Obviously, we've shown very good results on the Medical side for the past 6 quarters. But obviously, it's not sustainable at that high level, although we remain very optimistic in our ability to gain market share. And the foot traffic into the Medical office is not really as important as us gaining bigger account."

Number two is I don't think there's any major -- changed dynamics on the competitor side. It is a competitive market, to be sure. There's no shortage of competitors. Everybody's fighting for that last dollar. So it is a competitive market. Having said that, we do own some brands in the discount area, and they did not see any real change in dynamics. They're trending more or less the same as ours. We have those interests in these businesses just so we can keep an eye on what's going on, on that side.

I think we've mentioned the last couple of calls that the sales in Medical, in some extent, is to a large extent, dependent on bringing on these larger accounts, and they come on board in a lumpy way. So we've brought a lot of these accounts onboard in the last 2 years. It's obviously not sustainable at these phenomenal rates because the market is not growing above these rates. The markets probably, and there's no specific data, is growing by a couple of hundred basis points and definitely not because of inflation, because pricing is moving from branded to generics on the pharmaceutical side and on the med surg side. So we've had very healthy growth in this area, organic. We're growing on top of that. So I would repeat what we've said in previous calls that we are gaining market share. I think we're gaining very nicely on the market share side organically. Of course, the Cardinal acquisition did help, but organically, I think that's where the impetus is coming, so -- from. So I'm not sure as I said, I think, in my -- I think in the prepared remarks, that these double-digit growth numbers are sustainable in Medical, but we will grow at a multiple of the market, and we will increase our profits in this area, as we drive more profitable mix in products in this area. We're very happy with our Medical business. Now on Cardinal side, the integration of the Cardinal Health physician office business is substantially complete, and we have received positive feedback from the acquired customer base. There's a lot of change going on in health care, and we are in the process of modifying our purchase commitment to Cardinal to reflect the rapidly changing environment that makes more business sense from both of our point of view. We're creating greater flexibility in our relationship with Cardinal, specifically around the Integrated Delivery Networks. They are better at servicing aspects of the IDN, and we are better at servicing other aspects of the IDN. So we are modifying the marketing arrangement with Cardinal, and there are certain products that doesn't make sense for us to buy from Cardinal, as they have very good procurement pricing as it relates to hospitals. But the demand for choice in the physician market is much greater than in the hospital where formularies can be mandated, and not so much mandated in the physician space and even in large group practices. So we're modifying this thinking right now with Cardinal, but I would say our internal growth is pretty good in the physician space, arguably, the best of all the players, the bigger players, and we are very optimistic about this business, and actually optimistic about the strategic direction we can take this business in over the next 5 years."

However, sales in our Medical, Animal Health, Technology, Value-Added Services businesses were strong as well as in aspects of our North American Dental business, and we will again provide further color on specifics after you had the details from Steven. 
Over the years, our business has been quite predictable. And as an organization, Henry Schein has been able to adapt, seize opportunities and address challenges. We believe that our business model and strategic plan, including our continued investments, will drive our growth over the long term, and in fact, in the medium term, and we remain extremely well-positioned at each of our vertical markets we serve, not only to gain market share, but of course, to manage our investments very carefully. We have a seasoned management team that is very good at these points, and particularly, at gaining market share and managing our investments in a very strategic way. 
On a granular level, looking at plans for the U.K. to leave the European Union, they're on a very early stage and what is -- which is likely to be a 2-year process, many say not much starts until early next year. Surely, there will be developments along the way, but let me be clear that Henry Schein's commitment to the U.K. remains unchanged, and so does our commitment to the European Union. We continue to believe that the U.K. and Europe on the whole represent attractive long-term opportunities in both our dental and Animal Health businesses and past even in our Medical business in the long term. We expect to continue to execute well in our value-added customer approach just as we did before the Brexit vote.

As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 second quarter results include a favorable proposed tax settlement of $4.5 million or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Q2 2016 results also include restructuring cost of $20.4 million pretax or $0.18 per diluted share. Our prior year Q2 2015 results also include restructuring cost of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. 
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes those restructuring costs, as we believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparisons of financial results between periods, where certain items may vary, independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes, and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see our Exhibit B to this morning's earnings release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
So turning to our results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 25, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 9.3% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. This consisted of 9.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 7.6%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 2.1%. 
Also when further normalizing the switches between agency and direct sales, our internal sales growth in local currencies for the company for Q2 was 5.8%. You can see the details of our sales growth also contained in today's earnings news release on Exhibit A. 
If you look at the operating margin on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2016, it was 6.3% and contracted 67 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015. The increase in restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year negatively impacted the contraction by 43 basis points. 
Acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, as well as the switches from agency to direct sales, also combined to negatively impact our contraction by 9 basis points. The remaining contraction was primarily driven by lower-than-expected sales growth in our North American Dental business relative to our other businesses. As a result of this, we have extended our restructuring period to the end of 2016 in order to continue to reduce our cost structure. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs, our effective tax rate was 27.4%. This compares with an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.8% for the second quarter of 2015 when also excluding restructuring costs. 
As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate this quarter reflects approximately $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable proposed tax settlement. We also expect this settlement to reduce our ongoing effective tax rate going forward. More specifically, we anticipate that our effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the 29% range for the remainder of the year, and previously, we had guided that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the 30% range. If we look at net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis, it was $120.1 million or $1.46 per diluted share, representing increases of 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring costs in both periods, our adjusted net income attributable to Henry Schein was $135.4 million or $1.64 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 9.9% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the prior year. 
Foreign exchange impact on diluted EPS for the quarter was not material. I'd also like to note that at current exchange rates, we expect the foreign exchange translation of our -- outside of the U.S. earnings to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half of the year by at least $0.02 per diluted share, and that's related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound sterling. 
Let me now provide some detail on sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the second quarter of 2016 increased 4% to $1.4 billion. This consisted of 4.1% growth in constant currencies and a small 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.3%. Our North American internal growth in constant currencies was 2%, and it included 1.8% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 2.7% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue.  As we noted in our press release, our Q2 dental sales in North America reflect softness that began in early June. Our performance was also impacted by a decision to stop selling certain precious metals products. These products have a very low gross margin, and are relatively immaterial to our profitability. Precious metal sales negatively impacted our North American Dental merchandise sales growth in Q2 by approximately 50 basis points. So again, if you -- our growth would be 50 basis points higher without the decision to stop selling precious metals. 
This will continue to impact our merchandise sales growth until it annualizes. So it will continue for the next 3 quarters. As Stanley mentioned, we are extremely well positioned among our dental customers, and we will continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will drive our growth over the long term. 
Looking at international internal growth in local currencies, our Dental Group was 4.2% growth and included 4.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 3.1% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. That growth internationally was driven specifically by Italy, France and Spain, to a large extent. 
Animal Health sales were $853.6 million in the second quarter. That was an increase of 14%. This included growth of 15.2% in local currencies and a decline of 1.2% related to foreign currency exchange. Our internal sales in local currencies grew 11.8%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 3.4% to our growth. 
Looking at the North American Animal Health sales. Internal sales growth in constant currencies was 18.8%. And when normalizing the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales, our growth was 11.4% in North America. We believe this normalized growth rate is more -- is a more meaningful -- sorry, I mean, more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and also reflects the strength of a broader Animal Health market. Our international Animal Health sales growth internally in constant currencies was 4.9%. 
Looking at our Medical Group. Our Medical sales were $538.8 million in the second quarter, and that was an increase of 14.4%. Foreign exchange had virtually no impact on our sales growth. That 14.5% growth included 14.9% growth in North America and 2.4% growth in local currencies internationally. Again, when normalizing for the impact of agency sales in the prior year, North American internal growth was 10.4%, and this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains for our North American Medical business. So indeed, we have been outperforming the Medical market by a fairly significant margin for the past 6 quarters, and we have effectively capitalized in the growing market trend towards larger group practices, including IDNs or integrated delivery networks. 
Our Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $107 million for the quarter, representing a 19.6% growth. This included 20.4% growth in constant currencies and a 0.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated growth was 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 12.3%. The 8.1% internal growth in local currencies included 8.5% growth in North America, and 6.4% growth internationally. I'd like to highlight that our North American sales growth included more than 20% growth in our financial services business.  Our financial services business includes equipment and practice financing, credit card processing, practice brokerage and patient collections, as well as other services. Our core software products and upgrades of Technology and Value-Added Services businesses also aims to provide customers with solutions that are efficient and patient friendly, allowing them to generate more business, manage content among multiple sites and improve the overall practice management. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market. More specifically, we purchased 337,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $169.41, and that represented about $57 million. The impact on the current quarter of that purchase was immaterial to our EPS. I think it's important to note at the close of the quarter, we had approximately $243 million authorized for future repurchases of common stock, and we continue to believe that our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activity, will continue to drive increased shareholder value. If we look at some brief highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million compared to $207 million in the prior year, and we believe we'll continue to have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
Accounts receivable days outstanding was 40.8 days this quarter compares to 39.3 days last year. Inventory turns for the quarter were 5.6 turns, and that compares to 5.8 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2016 financial guidance. We are revising our guidance due to the impact of a number of factors. These factors include the ongoing business and economic uncertainty related to the Brexit vote, which will have a potential impact on the U.K. as well as the rest of Europe. As noted earlier, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling at current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact our diluted EPS in the second half by at least $0.02, and this new guidance also includes a cautious view of the North American Dental market. 
So for 2016, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $6.55 to $6.60, which represents growth of 10% to 11% compared with the 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.96. All of these adjusted diluted EPS numbers exclude restructuring costs, and this compares to our previous guidance, which was $6.55 to $6.65. Our guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only, given that the company cannot reasonably project the restructuring cost that we expect to incur in the second half of 2016. For the same reason, the company is unable to address the probable significance of that information. 
Our guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations, as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions as well as restructuring costs. We now anticipate that the restructuring initiatives will continue into the second half of the year as we continue to reduce our operating costs in light of some of these market conditions. 
At this time, again, we're not able to provide estimates for this impact in our 2016 financial results. Specifically, for Q3, we expect our growth in adjusted diluted EPS, again excluding restructuring costs, to be in the mid-single-digits. So mid-single-digit growth for Q3, but we obviously expect the growth to accelerate in Q4. This guidance also assumes foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels as of now. However, we do believe that there's a possibility that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, and remember that 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
Also, I'd like to conclude by mentioning that our fourth quarter results, since we're on a 52-, 53-week basis, ending on the last Saturday of December, include an extra week. So 2016 consists of 53 weeks. The extra week is in Q4 of 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ], and it's the last week of our fiscal year, which is the holiday week at the end of the year. So sales are typically lower during that week, and we typically don't have the same level of profitability because of fixed costs remaining relatively constant. 
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call over back to Stanley."

We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and o",1769,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with dental. As Steve noted, North America dental sales were impacted by softness in the U.S. that began in early June. We believe the strength of our relationship with our customers and our commitment to delivering value to their practices will continue to be key to our long-term success, and as in the past, will enable us to continue to gain market share, not only in the United States, but globally in the dental market. Although the sales growth was lower than expected in the second quarter, we believe we have a proven and successful model of delivering value-added solutions to our customers, and we have increased our focus on delivering on better sales results in the short term. As evidence of this commitment, during our second quarter, we announced an investment in Custom Automated Prosthetics, known as CAP. CAP is a U.S. digital laboratory supply company with 2015 sales of approximately $30 million. They offer CAD/CAM equipment as well as a full line of zirconia materials. The integration of CAP with Zahn, which is our dental laboratory business, and our Custom Milling Center furthers our commitment to providing dental laboratory customers with a greater selection of digital equipment, materials and services. We believe these products will help them, our laboratory customers, to navigate through the important digital transition that is occurring in the dental technology space today and I might add, at a rapid pace. 
Further supporting our commitment to advanced technology and to help prepare the next generation of dental professionals for advances in digital dentistry, in May, we announced the opening of the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Kornberg School of Dentistry. Technology advancements are affecting almost every aspect of the practice of dentistry, and we are committed not only to bringing those advancements to our customers, but also to making sure our current and future customers are well-versed in all aspects of running an efficient and profitable practice, while allowing for high-quality patient care.  Dental students and faculty at Temple University now have access to the latest 3D imaging equipment, intraoral scanners and milling machines made available as a result of this partnership. 
Regarding our dental -- digital -- regarding our digital dentistry efforts, we continue to see strong growth in sales of digital impression solutions with our 3M, 3shape and PlanScan scanner offerings. The breadth of our product offering is reflected -- is reflective of our belief that customers want choice and open architecture for their restorative dentistry needs. This also creates opportunity for follow-on software and mill sales when these dental practices are ready to move to full scale in our systems. With Zahn Dental and CAP, we continue to be well positioned to provide innovative solutions to the lab market for restorations that are outsourced from the practice. Let me just add that in North America, CAD/CAM sales were strong in the second quarter, driven by digital scanner sales, while our traditional sales for -- traditional equipment sales were soft, and I might add, partially due to timing. 
Lastly, I'd like to comment on a recent change in our Global Dental surgical group. As of June, BioHorizons has become the exclusive distributor of CAMLOG-branded products in the United States and Canada. This creates a unified sales force in the U.S. for complete dental offerings to specialists and general practitioners. By combining the 2 sales forces for these high-quality, complementary brands, we are creating a more efficient go-to-market strategy, giving our customers access to a greater selection of products and services from high-quality branded to high-quality economy implants with a wide variety of clinical-based products. It also will afford more robust North American coverage and strengthening our position to effectively compete and grow our market share in, as I said, the premium and the value-added segments of the dental implant market. We look forward to continued success in this important segment. These businesses are and actually have been doing quite well for a while. 
Now let me turn and of course, happy to answer more questions on the dental side during the rest of the call. On the Animal Health side, as Steven mentioned, when normalizing for Animal Health results, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.4% in North America, reflective of a healthy market, but also reflective of market share gains. We have been gaining market share in North America in the Animal Health arena for a while now. International currencies sales during the second quarter were up 12%, with organic growth complemented by acquisition growth. We are making good progress with our diagnostic product portfolio, targeting practices that are nearing end of the instrument lease agreements, as well as growing clinics with a need for multiple systems for high-volume testing. Indeed, sales of diagnostic products in North America grew in the low double digits in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. We believe this is ahead of the market growth in this sector. 
Axis-Q continues to be an attractive element of our sales proposals as customers are strong benefits and efficiency -- see strong benefits in efficiently linking their Practice Management Software with their diagnostic instruments. This is a holistic approach. It's not selling devices nor is it selling software. It's the interoperability of devices and software connected to the Practice Management system, the clinical workstation. 
As a reminder, Henry Schein's Practice Management Software is today used by more than 50% of the U.S. veterinary practices. Again, strategy here in the Animal Health space is doing very well, well thought out and being well-executed, of course, not only in the U.S. but throughout the world in the Animal Health arena, where Henry Schein is, in fact, active. 
Let me now turn to Medical. The reported growth in our Medical Group of 14.5% was impacted by agency sales in the prior year. When normalizing for this impact, the core internal growth for North America Medical was 10.4% as Steven mentioned. And let me stress, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains. We continue to see solid growth from large group practices, including IDNs, the Integrated Delivery Networks, as we onboard new customer wins from the past year. These are internal growth wins that we've been working on for a while and that are bearing fruit. 
In addition, the expansion of large health systems, with which we have built strong relationships over the past several years, is contributing to our growth. Our focus on the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market is yielding solid results as well, as we are seeing strong sales in this sector, and our teams are making inroads with our smaller market segments, including universities and sports medicine. So we have a growing base of customers who rely on our broad, Value-Added Services model. 
Now let me talk about the Technology and Value-Added Services group. We are pleased again with the second quarter performance of this business group. North American Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 8.5% in local currencies, matched the highest growth rate in more than 3 years. Strategic acquisitions have bolstered our market share in this business, as sales in local currencies increased by more than 21% in North America during the second quarter by nearly 15% internationally. Of course, we are very pleased with these results, as reported to the P&Ls of these businesses. But let me remind our investors that, in fact, it's the stickiness, the Value-Added Services, that our practice solutions group brings to bear in our customer base that has the real strategic value. Enhancing digital platforms across the businesses we serve is an important priority for Henry Schein, in fact, one of our largest and perhaps most important priorities. We provide a means for our customers to better connect with their patients and improve overall efficiency, thereby, reinforcing our value to their practices, and in fact, allowing our customers to show their value to their patients. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to drive interoperability with devices and of course, the cloud to manage workflows. 
We are very, very pleased with the progress we made specifically on our cloud-based dental product and the connection between our Practice Management Software and the devices in the dental space, whether it is in the imaging area or in the prosthetics area. Likewise, as I reported earlier on, in the Animal Health space with our diagnostic and imaging product offerings that are connected so well to our Practice Management Software, which will only get better over time. 
So as you may know, 2015 was a special year for Henry Schein as we mark 20 years as a publicly traded company. In May, we had the opportunity to celebrate this milestone as we opened trading at the NASDAQ stock market. 20 years ago, we had a vision for what Henry Schein could become. Since then, more and more people have joined us in sharing that vision in building our company and expanding our presence in the global markets we serve, and all the while, we have demonstrated we can successfully serve shareholders, while also serving society, and of course, our suppliers and our customers and the team. We are pleased to have accomplished so much as a result of the hard work of Team Schein Members across the globe over the past 2 -- 20 years since we've been public. 
We continue to be most optimistic about our strategies. We are unwavering in executing our strategic plan, which revolves around the notion of helping practitioners operate a more efficient practice while providing better clinical care. We feel that we have the right strategies and the tactics in place, and we'll, of course, make sure that we manage our expenses in a way that delivers on our commitments to our shareholders.  Lastly, we are pleased to announce that in June, Henry Schein moved up to #268 in the ranking of the Fortune 500, celebrating our 13th year as one of America's largest corporations. This is testament to more than 19,000 Team Schein Members throughout the world, who are dedicated to helping our customers build better practices, so they can provide better quality care. We, of course, have been on the list of the Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the entire period. 
So with that commentary and an overview of our quarterly results from both a financial and operating performance point of view, thank you for your attention, and we're, of course, ready to answer any questions that shareholders may have."

Dental, soft. But if I back out that a little bit of precious metals, consumables still growing north of 2%, so no big disaster there. But Steve, when I look at your guidance, you're taking it down $0.05 at the top, another $0.05 if I adjust for the tax rate update you provided today. It just seems like it's a pretty sizable takedown in guidance of $0.05 to $0.10, I'm sorry, at the top line when there's strength elsewhere in the business.

And while we're not convinced that this is a long-term permanent impact, we do want to make sure that if it continues for a little while, that our guidance is sustainable. We do have foreign exchange headwinds. We do expect, although we haven't seen much impact right now in the U.K., we do expect that the U.K. market will soften. And as you probably know, about 8% of our revenues are in the U.K. market between dental and Animal Health. We also, because I know you know this also, but when you look at profitability, U.S. dental on the distribution business is our most profitable business. So we have a mix issue on profitability, where most profitable business is growing the slowest. And while Medical and Animal Health are nicely profitable. They're just not as profitable. So there's a lot of things going on, Jeff, and we just feel that, right now, given that we were not expecting this June sales slowdown, is the time to be a little bit cautious in the market. So hopefully that helps you a little bit."

We do expect an uptick, a modest uptick in consumable sales in the U.S. But again, we're trying to be cautious, and I'd like to point out when you look at our margin, look at the components of our margin, for the quarter, excluding restructuring costs, our operating expenses are down 35 basis points versus the prior year. And if you exclude the acquisitions in the last 12 months, operating expenses are actually down 55 basis points. So our restructuring activities are making us more efficient. But on the gross margin level, dental consumable sales, the distribution are our highest gross margin business. So again, we're trying to be cautious in the market and a little bit conservative.

Let me just add a little bit more flavor.

First of all, there is no IMS data, as we said, over the past -- in dentistry, but it's our view that essentially from a units point of view, the market is flat. It's not going down. It's not going up, talking about the U.S. consumable market, and we think that the market is growing at about 2%, which is essentially price increases. We -- there is an independent market data product out there. It's not accurate, but it does show modest sequential downturn, and it is more or less accurate directionally, but 2 months is not a statistically valid view of that market from our point of view. We've also spoken to several key manufacturers who support this view that the consumable business in the U.S. is essentially flat with a couple of 100 basis points of inflation. So we're talking about 100 basis points, 80 basis points margin of error. It's very, very small. And in that context, we believe we are still gaining market share and have gained market share consistently for a while. We hear this from all of the major, most of the major, if not, all of the major manufacturers. So we want to take a cautious view. I will be quick to say that our demand for equipment is good. One of our key manufacturers was delayed a little bit in the second quarter with providing equipment, a new system which we have taken a lot of orders for. We believe that those -- that equipment will be delivered in time for the fixed third quarter. So we are looking at a much better second quarter. But within these hundreds of basis points, this way, that way, we want to be on the cautious side. I also mentioned earlier on that we are doing quite well with CAD/CAM sales, particularly with scanners. So we have to be careful not to be too negative, but also want to be cautious here. And yes, our Medical, our Animal Health, our oral surgery, our dental specialty businesses, in general, remains solid. In fact, our corporate accounts business, our special markets business in dentistry is actually doing quite well and so is the mid-market. The area what we just can't put our finger on right now is what's happening to the smaller, Main Street dentist in the U.S. And again, overall, we do see that we are gaining market share in this country and abroad in all of our businesses. We don't see any area on the strategic side we want to moderate or change. Perhaps, we want to advance the solutions business, leading with software a little bit faster. But overall, I think Steven is right to be on the cautious side, and we want to reduce the top end a bit of our guidance. So it's really cautionary, indicative of these numerous areas that may be slightly questionable, including the economy in this country and in Europe. We're actually quite comfortable that we will deliver good results in the end in Europe, but the economy in Europe is out of our control. So that's why we'd like to be a little bit more cautious and also control our expenses a little bit more carefully."

And again, we want to be careful about not creating expectations that we're going to report monthly sales on an ongoing basis. But because of this particular situation, it caught -- I must say, it caught us a little bit by surprise heading into our dental national sales meeting in June. It is possible that a little bit of a downtick occurred because our entire sales force was out at the field for a while. But to answer the question directly, May -- April and May were pretty good in the implant business. June was a challenge, but it would appear that July bounced back. But again, John, we're talking within hundreds of basis points both sides, not even 100, 100 or so basis points both sides. So I'm not sure if this was conclusive on the downside or conclusive on the upside. I will say the U.S. implant market is quite strong. We're comfortable with the European markets for implants. But on the margin, our implant business has been driven by a few countries, not by Henry Schein on the ground but through distribution agents in countries like Russia and Turkey and even Japan, and -- these are markets that have been very helpful, again, driving within 100 basis points here or there growth, but we're a little cautious about these markets. Having said that, let me quickly remind that we're quite comfortable with our 2 big markets for BioHorizons, the U.S., Canada and for Camlog, Germany and the Dutch region."

But I had to tell you, there are manufacturers that have shown us that business has been good.

Yes, we are doing better than the market, both here and in Europe, but it is doing well. It's alive and well. We saw similar things, and I don't want to draw anymore analogy to what I'm about to say than just a narrow point I'm going to make. Don't read any trends into this. But in 2008, '09 and '10, Animal Health mostly, in most of those quarters, did better than dental, but I don't want to come to any conclusions because there are a lot of other factors in dental, insurance. We have to also remember, I think we may have gotten a false positive in the first quarter because our growth was significant on consumables, and that may have been due to weather. I think the dental market in the United States has been more or less flat for a while and driven a little bit by inflation, and also, perhaps, visits to implant dentists a little bit more. But again, we're in a few hundred basis points here in dental, and it's hard to gauge what is happening specifically within that range. Having said that, the Animal Health market is a healthy market around the world, driven by the middle class, and as we've said before, many times, the baby boomers. They're buying more pets. Again, I'm not really speaking on behalf of the agri side of it, the production side, which has its own dynamics related to the milk price, the meat price, but Henry Schein is not a big player in that space with exception of a few markets like Ireland or New Zealand, where we are in the dairy field and in a couple of markets Australia and in parts of Europe, where we have some production. But from the pet point of view, it's growing. The demand for pets is growing, and people are spending more money. We've seen that with our customers, both the customer that is public and the customers that are not public. It's a hot space. It's a good space, and I would say the medical space is good too, but it's not driven by consumer issues on the Medical side. It's driven by a realignment in the way in which health care is provided. Obviously, we've shown very good results on the Medical side for the past 6 quarters. But obviously, it's not sustainable at that high level, although we remain very optimistic in our ability to gain market share. And the foot traffic into the Medical office is not really as important as us gaining bigger account."

Everybody's fighting for that last dollar. So it is a competitive market. Having said that, we do own some brands in the discount area, and they did not see any real change in dynamics.

I think we've mentioned the last couple of calls that the sales in Medical, in some extent, is to a large extent, dependent on bringing on these larger accounts, and they come on board in a lumpy way. So we've brought a lot of these accounts onboard in the last 2 years. It's obviously not sustainable at these phenomenal rates because the market is not growing above these rates. The markets probably, and there's no specific data, is growing by a couple of hundred basis points and definitely not because of inflation, because pricing is moving from branded to generics on the pharmaceutical side and on the med surg side. So we've had very healthy growth in this area, organic. We're growing on top of that. So I would repeat what we've said in previous calls that we are gaining market share. I think we're gaining very nicely on the market share side organically. Of course, the Cardinal acquisition did help, but organically, I think that's where the impetus is coming, so -- from. So I'm not sure as I said, I think, in my -- I think in the prepared remarks, that these double-digit growth numbers are sustainable in Medical, but we will grow at a multiple of the market, and we will increase our profits in this area, as we drive more profitable mix in products in this area. We're very happy with our Medical business. Now on Cardinal side, the integration of the Cardinal Health physician office business is substantially complete, and we have received positive feedback from the acquired customer base. There's a lot of change going on in health care, and we are in the process of modifying our purchase commitment to Cardinal to reflect the rapidly changing environment that makes more business sense from both of our point of view. We're creating greater flexibility in our relationship with Cardinal, specifically around the Integrated Delivery Networks. They are better at servicing aspects of the IDN, and we are better at servicing other aspects of the IDN. So we are modifying the marketing arrangement with Cardinal, and there are certain products that doesn't make sense for us to buy from Cardinal, as they have very good procurement pricing as it relates to hospitals. But the demand for choice in the physician market is much greater than in the hospital where formularies can be mandated, and not so much mandated in the physician space and even in large group practices. So we're modifying this thinking right now with Cardinal, but I would say our internal growth is pretty good in the physician space, arguably, the best of all the players, the bigger players, and we are very optimistic about this business, and actually optimistic about the strategic direction we can take this business in over the next 5 years."

339447,405246534,1069873,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 m",2158,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Also, our prior year third quarter results include a onetime income tax benefit net of controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable tax ruling.
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes the restructuring costs and the prior year tax benefit as we believe the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling comparison of financial results between prior periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for a greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see in Exhibit B of this morning's earnings release a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
So first, turning to our sales results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 24, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 6.7% increase compared with the prior year's third quarter. And this consists of 7.7% growth in constant currency and a 1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.0%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%. When further normalizing our results for switches between agency sales and direct sales, that internal sales growth in local currencies for Q3 was 5.6%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings release.
We go to operating margin, on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2016 was 7.0%. And that was a contraction of 3 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2015. There are 3 key items that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 17 basis points. The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and the related expenses for those acquisitions as well as the switches between agency sales and direct sales. They, combined, negatively impacted the contraction by 14 basis points. Second, flu vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, and that negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points. This was offset by the third item that was related to a decrease in restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, and that favorably impacted the contraction by 12 basis points. So when you net out those 3 items, the net impact of 3 -- these items, our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis expanded by 14 basis points.
If you look at our reported GAAP effective tax rates for the quarter, it was 28.9%. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, it was slightly lower at 28.7%. This compares with an adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.6% for the third quarter. As you'll recall, we had a favorable tax audit that we discussed last quarter that allowed us to reduce our overall ongoing effective tax rate, and we expect next quarter the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the same 28% range that we're showing this quarter.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis was $133.7 million or $1.63 per diluted share, representing increases of 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively, both compared with last year. Excluding these structuring costs, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter was $137.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, compared with last year, also on a non-GAAP basis. 
I think it's important to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.01, and that was offset by share repurchases, which benefited by about the same approximate $0.01. So they kind of netted each other out.
Let me provide some additional details on sales by business group. Dental sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 5.6% growth in local currencies and a 0.5% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%.
Looking at North America, the North American internal growth in local currencies was 4.4%, and that included 1.8% growth in sale of dental consumable merchandise products and 13.3% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. I'd like to point out that the dental equipment revenue benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales from Q4 into Q3, and that was associated in part with some promotional activities that occurred in the third quarter. 
I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals that we discussed last quarter. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental merchandise sales during the current quarter by approximately 50 basis points, and that'll continue to impact our merchandise sales growth for the next 2 quarters until fully annualized. Our annual sales of precious metals in the prior year was approximately $14 million. And again, that won't reoccur in 2016 or going forward.
Our international internal growth in local currencies of our dental group was 3.1% and included 2.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 4.2% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. On an overall basis, we believe we outpaced the global dental market for the current quarter, and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remains strong.
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales was $790.3 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.9%. The components include growth of 10.6% in constant currencies and 2.7% decline related to foreign currency. Internal sales in local currencies grew 8.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 2.0% to our growth. That 8.6% internal growth in constant currencies consisted of 10.0% growth in North America and 7.2% growth internationally. The normalized impact of Animal Health results, which again accounts for the switching of products from agency to direct sales, that 8.6% internal growth in local currencies reflects a 6.9% growth, including 6.6% in North America. Again, this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. We believe these were solid results, and we believe we continue to gain market share, both domestically and overseas in Animal Health.
Turning to Medical. Medical sales was $639.6 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.1%, which is all internally generated. There's no material impact of sales growth related to foreign currency for this business, and the components of that 7.1% included growth of 7.4% in North America and a slight decline of 0.9% internationally. Again, we're pleased with the Medical growth, and we believe we gained market share also in the medical market.
Last, turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $104.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. That included 18.3% growth in constant currencies and a 1.6% decline related to foreign currency. The components of that constant currency internal growth was internally generated sales increase of 7.6%, and acquisition growth was an additional 10.7%. And that 7.6% growth globally included 7.0% growth in North America and 10.8% growth internationally. I'd like to point out that the North American sales were highlighted by growth of more than 11% in our financial services businesses. These businesses include equipment and practice financing, credit card practicing, practice brokerage, patient collections and other services. Internationally, the technology sales growth was driven primarily by increased software services. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market. Specifically we repurchased 1.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $163.62, and that is approximately $193 million. As I said earlier, the impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter EPS was about $0.01 favorable.
Our share repurchase program demonstrates our long-term commitment to create further value for shareholders and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. In line with this, we increased share repurchases in the third quarter at a greater rate than prior quarters.
Also, on October 19, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of an additional $400 million of shares of the company's common stock. That's in addition to the program that was announced in December of '15, and we have completed the purchase of that December '15 repurchase program. 
Again, we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $178.1 million. That compares to $107.4 million last year. And again, we believe that strong cash flow will continue for the balance of the year.
Our DSO, or day sales outstanding and accounts receivable, was up slightly to 42.4 days for the  current versus 40.6 days last year. And inventory turns, the other key metric, was 5.6 turns. And that's relatively unchanged from last year, which was 5.7 turns.
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing both our 2016 and 2017 financial guidance. For 2016, we expect GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $6.11 to $6.16. That represents growth of 7% to 8% compared with the GAAP diluted EPS of $5.69 for 2015. Adjusting non-GAAP -- adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, excluding restructuring costs ranging from $0.42 to $0.46 per diluted share, is expected to be $6.55 to $6.60 for 2016. And that represents growth of 10% to 11% compared to the adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.96 for 2015.
I'd also like to note that a significant portion of our EPS in the current quarter in excess of the consensus estimates for the current quarter was impacted by favorable timing versus the fourth quarter. The 2016 guidance assumes Q4 adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS in the high single-digit to low double-digit range or in the high single-digit range on a GAAP basis. Guidance for 2016 GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact of potential future acquisitions, if any, or any restructuring costs. 
Henry Schein expects that the current restructuring activities to be completed this year in the fourth quarter. We expect restructuring costs in Q4 2016 to be $17 million to $22 million pretax or $0.15 to $0.19 per diluted share. I'll also point out that our 2016 guidance assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with the current levels. However, we believe that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, especially against the British pound. And remember that about 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollar.
I'll also just remind people that our results this year are on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So fiscal 2016 consists of 53 weeks. This extra week is in the last week of Q4 2016. And obviously, since that's a holiday week at the end of the year between Christmas and New Year's, sales are generally lower during that week. And we anticipate that the extra week will not materially add to our earnings since fixed expenses remain relatively constant. When we report Q4 results, we'll also provide information on the sales impact of that extra week.
Turning to next year, we're introducing 2017 financial guidance as follows. GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. Since we do not expect to incur any restructuring costs in 2017, there is no separate non-GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance will be the only guidance that we're reporting. And this guidance reflects 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year and 9% to 11% on a non-GAAP basis when using the non-GAAP numbers for the prior year and the midpoint of those non-GAAP numbers.
Similarly to the 2016 guidance, the 2017 guidance is for current operations, does not include any previously announced acquisitions or the potential impact of future acquisition. And again, I'll point out that we assume foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. 
So with that quick summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."
339447,405246534,1069873,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well",1375,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well in the third quarter with particular strength in the implant sales worldwide. 
While the dental consumable merchandise market continued to reflect somewhat slower-than-historic growth, it appears to be stable. Though not back to the levels we saw a couple of quarters ago, we believe that the soft U.S. dental market is more temporary as September sales growth accelerated although October was somewhat soft. We believe that October sales growth was negatively impacted by the weather in certain areas of the country.
I would note that we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable EPS growth even during soft market conditions. North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies is 13.3% during the quarter. Why, shall I say? Sales of high-tech equipment with strong CAD/CAM and Zahn Custom Automated Prosthetic product sales experienced double-digit year-over-year internal growth in local currencies. Note that equipment growth benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales growth associated in part with a promotion in the quarter. 
Favorable dental equipment purchases are typically a leading indicator of dental practitioner sentiment. We do believe that the third quarter equipment sales in North America, coupled with the potential benefit from the Section 179 tax incentive, indicate that current market slowness may not prevail over the long term. That said, we are still closely monitoring industry data points as they become available in order to gauge the growth of the dental end market in North America. We would like to see additional future market data to draw any firm conclusion on sales trends. 
As we implement initiatives to expand digital dentistry in North America and abroad, we are pleased to report that sales of our digital impression solutions continue to be strong. Year-over-year, quarterly sales, once again, grew in double digits for our global prosthetic solutions business worldwide. We have an excellent product offering with scanners from PlanScan, 3shape and 3M in North America, Australia and New Zealand, supported by a software platform that features all-in-one capabilities and open architecture. This allows dentists to choose the best technology for their practice. 
In Europe, we are the leading distributor of ceramic [ph] dental equipment. We are playing an important role in educating dental practitioners on the benefits of CAD/CAM technology and integrated digital workflows. And we are well positioned as the market adoption continues to evolve.
As I mentioned, sales of dental specialty products, which include implants, orthodontics and endodontics, did well this quarter. In particular, we posted low double-digit worldwide sales growth with dental implants. Today, we are well positioned to leverage the attractive opportunities in these fast-growing markets with high-margin products. Our dental specialty product offering is highly synergistic with our core dental business, as an increasing number of general petitioners are now performing more specialty procedures themselves rather than referring them out. It is our goal to capitalize on our relationships with these GPs, these general petitioners, and help their practices generate new sources of revenue while providing with their customers, their patients with a great quality of service and clinical value to their patients.
Finally, with respect to our Dental business. During the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire an 80% ownership position in Marrodent, one of Poland's largest full-service dental distributors with 2015 sales of approximately $32 million. Marrodent marks the company's entry into the Poland dental market, opening opportunities for approximately 20,000 dental offices to do business with us and building upon our presence following our 2014 entry into the animal health market in Poland, which has proven to be most successful for the company. 
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. We look forward to serving the Polish dental community with the same high standards of commitment to efficiency and success that customers throughout the world have come to expect from Henry Schein, helping our new Polish customers operate a more efficient practice so that they can, in the end, provide better quality care to their patients.
Now let me touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results for agency switches, our entire internal sales growth in local currency was 6.6% in North America. International sales through the third quarter were up 11% in local currencies, with 7.2% internal growth complemented by our strategic acquisition, including KRUUSE in Denmark and Medka in Australia. We believe the Animal Health markets in U.S. and abroad are healthy and continue to grow. With our focus on the companion animal segment in the U.S., we see significant opportunity to expand our market share by servicing all the practices needs of office space that veterinarians with products and related services, including our software to address their clinical diagnostic and reference lab requirements. We do have an excellent portfolio products and services that is arguably the deepest in the industry. Our Practice Management and Axis-Q software solutions offer robust clinical integration features to connect diagnostic systems, capture revenue and help practice operate efficiency.
Our goal is to help Animal Health petitioners operate a more efficient practice so that they, too, can provide better quality care. We continue to believe we're making good progress in executing on our diagnostic sales strategy, and we're very pleased also with the performance of our global Animal Health group.
Let me now turn to our Medical group. We believe our Medical sales growth of 7.1%, all internally generated, was well in excess of the broader market and reflects our ability to increase market share as we capitalize on exposure to large group practices, including IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We continue to benefit from trends associated with Affordable Care Act in the U.S. as there are more covered lives and more procedures moving from the hospital setting to the general petitioner offices.
And the office petitioner, of course, is our primary customer. We believe our medical businesses can grow at a healthy rate in the high single-digits in a market that is currently growing in the low single digits, even potentially less.
I'll conclude my business overview with Technology and Value-Added Services. We are pleased with the third quarter performance of these businesses as we are with our other groups. Internal growth in local currencies was 7% in North America and 10.8% in our International business. North American sales were highlighted by growth of over 11% in financial services business, while international growth was primarily driven by software revenue. Strategic acquisitions contribute to growth in local currencies of nearly 18% in North America, including the contribution of VetStreet and growth of more than 21% internationally, driven by RxWorks.
Our technology offerings are key elements to our total solutions platform at Henry Schein. Technology will be a critical enabler of more efficient patient-friendly practices. We are investing in the development of products that would help us better service and grow our installed base. Lots of exciting activity going on in the technology group. Our next generations of solutions will be ready to meet the requirements of fast and easy access to data, the sharing of workflow in the cloud and streamline communication with patients. Interoperability with devices will also play a big role here and really doing great work in this part of the business.
So before we take your questions, I would like to make a few remarks about the future strategic initiatives of the company. We are beginning the process to develop the 2018, 2020 strategic plan. In keeping with our focus of providing value-added solutions to our customers, this plan will build on our foundation of delivery high-margin products, software and services that help petitioners drive more successful, more profitable businesses while providing the best in quality care. The combination of practice efficiency and providing quality care are the hallmark of the Henry Schein value-added services offering that will play a key role and we center to our 2018 to '20 strategic plan.
So operator, with those comments, we are ready to open the call for questions."

In our view, the soft U.S. dental consumable market is more temporary, in our view again, as September sales growth accelerated. Now just to be clear, we're talking about hundreds of basis points less than that swings. So it is hard to measure this impact on a month-to-month basis. September was strong, October was soft. We believe the October sales growth was negatively impacted by weather in certain areas in the market -- in the country. When I say soft, I mean relatively soft in terms of basis points, small numbers of basis points. It is still, in our view, too early to conclude whether the market will experience a more significant rebound. But it's really important to note that our U.S. dental equipment and our specialty product sales were strong during the quarter. By the way, our Canadian business is also strong, so that impacts the North American performance as well. We believe that the U.S. dental equipment positive trends are positive market indicators. So overall, the U.S. dental market is solid, probably flat from a unit point of view, very hard to tell. There are some units that are up in the specialty areas, and there's also some price compression because of perhaps competitiveness of 1 or 2 product categories. But overall, the market is solid, and very hard to make concrete, long-term decisions on trends based on 1 week's performance over another. But we believe dentists would not be investing in their practices if they didn't feel good about the practices. By the way, we do continue to feel very good about our Global Animal Health business, our U.S. Medical business, our International Dental business. And overall, we do feel very confident that we are gaining market share across all of our portfolios throughout the world. So it's a long answer to a short question."

One is the North American dental equipment sales, 13% growth in the current quarter, but some of that did pull forward from Q4. The second is favorable timing on influenza vaccines sales. I think as most people know, we can't control sales between Q3 and Q4, and we just had stronger versus last year. We had stronger sales growth in the current quarter versus last year's current quarter -- last year's third quarter. And the last is just some timing of some expenses. And again, all 3 of those we wanted to point out that while it was still a strong quarter, what was some favorable timing things that helped Q3 and will reverse in Q4. On your second question, Jeff, we -- I think you know that starting in June, the markets saw and unfortunately, we were the first to talk about it on our conference call. The U.S. dental market showed softness. We saw that softness really continue June, July and August at different rates, but not materially different rates. September was a very strong month from us. We were beginning to believe during September. And I'm talking about consumable merchandise in the U.S. Dental market specifically. We're beginning to believe that it was really just related to the summer and vacations for practices or patients but was very strong. And then October was not as strong. It was still a bit better than what we saw earlier, but geographically, you had the hurricane impact that negatively impacted things, you have the ADA trade show, that was in a different quarter than last year that negatively impacted us. So we still believe that October is potentially an indicator of positive signs. But as Stanley said, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. We would like to see some future data points. Equipment sales, we would expect to be strong again because of Section 179 in Q4. Stanley we also highlighted special sales to give you specifics on that specifically on Dental implants and I think everyone knows Dental implants typically, because they're high-priced products, high-priced procedures and very little insurance coverage, where patients are more conscious of their spend, typically, that's something that shows weakness earlier. But again, we had very strong dental implants sales. We had double-digit sales growth globally and even slightly higher than that in the U.S. market. So I think both equipment and the specialty sales are indicators that the market is stable and has potential. But we'll still be cautious. We don't have that perfect crystal ball."

So interested to hear from you how do you think the next 3 to 5 years in the dental market -- how are you going to compete differently than maybe you have over the last 3 to 5 maybe even 10 years. Obviously the DSOs are going to be a bigger part of the North American market. The rumors out there that may be some other competitors are trying to get into the North American dental market consumable side in the market.

I think we have to, of course, add to the value-added service proposition of Henry Schein. We have many business units that are offering different componentry to the dental market, whether it's products, specialty products, whether it is value-added services, software, e-commerce, different kinds of services from an education point of view, from practice transitions point of view, from the relationship with schools, we need to go out into the marketplace much more we're the one-stop proposition to our customers, including leveraging our businesses outside of dental, namely medical and to some extent, veterinary because they also are dealing with some of the schools and some of the institutions. So what we need to be doing is going out far more with a one-stop value-added service proposition. We are well-positioned, and I don't believe anyone has the array of services that we have and particularly on a global basis. We need to globalize more of our value-added services, be it in the digital prosthetic field or in software field. And interoperability will be key. So these are the various areas that we will focus on. Your last sentence about additional competition coming into our markets with large accounts, I think was what you implied, I don't think anything has changed there. There's been a lot of competition in that space. There will always be competition in that space. More of the business will go into the very large accounts, but more will go into the midsized accounts. And I believe that in our strategic vision for the future, we will focus on separate value-added service propositions with different sectors of the market: the very large, the mid-markets and the small, and these will be global propositions because of the same trend that we're seeing around the world, and our value-added service offering will be globalized. Yes, they will be customized to specific market needs, but there'd be strategic thinking behind these offerings and the services that we develop or services that we will develop, we'll be utilizing global resources and global solutions so with some customization for local needs. So we're very excited about the opportunities we have to further advance our value-added service proposition or specific sectors based on size of customer and adding to that the various value-added service solutions from a specialty point of view as well."

Price has been an issue in our markets for the 36 years that I've been in the business. So yes, price is important, but you have to balance price with value-added services. It costs money to develop value-added services. It costs money to field the sales force, although both the value-added services and the field source or field force need to be more efficient. They need to have more sales per head, and they need to have more sales per dollar invested in value-added services. So the combination of investment in the value-added services and price is what drives competition and the bottom line. We obviously have to sharpen that as we have done everything single year for decades. We have to sharpen, at the end of today, the price we charge for the value-added service and the products. Competition has always been there. So I'm not sure if there's anything new in the market other than we have to just continue with what we've done for decades, which is to provide a better proposition to our customers.

So it's directly related to more the consumable side. I would say that the better measure is looking at inventory turns, and that's been consistent. And our goal, quite frankly, is to improve turns over the next year or 2. There's still opportunities in the market from time to time to do small forward buying. So we take advantage of that where it's financially smart to do so. Typically, we're not buying forward any significant period of time. We only deal with 4 to 6 weeks. So it's very short-term buys.

We are pleased to report record financial results for the third quarter. We believe we gained market share in each of our business groups as the company continues to be well served by our diversified portfolio and an expanding global customer base. 
Today, we are affirming guidance for 2016 GAAP diluted EPS growth of 7% to 8% or 10% to 11% on an adjusted non-GPA (sic) [non-GAAP] basis. We are also pleased to introduce guidance for 2017 diluted EPS that represents growth of 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis or growth on a 9% to 11% basis -- on an adjusted non-GPA (sic) [non-GAAP] basis, both compared with respective midpoint of 2016 guidance.
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. But to set the tone, we remain very pleased with the state of the company, with our continued market share growth throughout the world and believe we are operating in very good markets. 
So Steven, please provide your financial report."
339447,405246534,1070125,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 m",2158,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Also, our prior year third quarter results include a onetime income tax benefit net of controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable tax ruling.
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes the restructuring costs and the prior year tax benefit as we believe the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling comparison of financial results between prior periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for a greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see in Exhibit B of this morning's earnings release a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
So first, turning to our sales results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 24, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 6.7% increase compared with the prior year's third quarter. And this consists of 7.7% growth in constant currency and a 1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.0%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%. When further normalizing our results for switches between agency sales and direct sales, that internal sales growth in local currencies for Q3 was 5.6%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings release.
We go to operating margin, on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2016 was 7.0%. And that was a contraction of 3 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2015. There are 3 key items that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 17 basis points. The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and the related expenses for those acquisitions as well as the switches between agency sales and direct sales. They, combined, negatively impacted the contraction by 14 basis points. Second, flu vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, and that negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points. This was offset by the third item that was related to a decrease in restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, and that favorably impacted the contraction by 12 basis points. So when you net out those 3 items, the net impact of 3 -- these items, our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis expanded by 14 basis points.
If you look at our reported GAAP effective tax rates for the quarter, it was 28.9%. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, it was slightly lower at 28.7%. This compares with an adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.6% for the third quarter. As you'll recall, we had a favorable tax audit that we discussed last quarter that allowed us to reduce our overall ongoing effective tax rate, and we expect next quarter the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the same 28% range that we're showing this quarter.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis was $133.7 million or $1.63 per diluted share, representing increases of 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively, both compared with last year. Excluding these structuring costs, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter was $137.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, compared with last year, also on a non-GAAP basis. 
I think it's important to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.01, and that was offset by share repurchases, which benefited by about the same approximate $0.01. So they kind of netted each other out.
Let me provide some additional details on sales by business group. Dental sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 5.6% growth in local currencies and a 0.5% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%.
Looking at North America, the North American internal growth in local currencies was 4.4%, and that included 1.8% growth in sale of dental consumable merchandise products and 13.3% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. I'd like to point out that the dental equipment revenue benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales from Q4 into Q3, and that was associated in part with some promotional activities that occurred in the third quarter. 
I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals that we discussed last quarter. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental merchandise sales during the current quarter by approximately 50 basis points, and that'll continue to impact our merchandise sales growth for the next 2 quarters until fully annualized. Our annual sales of precious metals in the prior year was approximately $14 million. And again, that won't reoccur in 2016 or going forward.
Our international internal growth in local currencies of our dental group was 3.1% and included 2.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 4.2% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. On an overall basis, we believe we outpaced the global dental market for the current quarter, and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remains strong.
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales was $790.3 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.9%. The components include growth of 10.6% in constant currencies and 2.7% decline related to foreign currency. Internal sales in local currencies grew 8.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 2.0% to our growth. That 8.6% internal growth in constant currencies consisted of 10.0% growth in North America and 7.2% growth internationally. The normalized impact of Animal Health results, which again accounts for the switching of products from agency to direct sales, that 8.6% internal growth in local currencies reflects a 6.9% growth, including 6.6% in North America. Again, this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. We believe these were solid results, and we believe we continue to gain market share, both domestically and overseas in Animal Health.
Turning to Medical. Medical sales was $639.6 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.1%, which is all internally generated. There's no material impact of sales growth related to foreign currency for this business, and the components of that 7.1% included growth of 7.4% in North America and a slight decline of 0.9% internationally. Again, we're pleased with the Medical growth, and we believe we gained market share also in the medical market.
Last, turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $104.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. That included 18.3% growth in constant currencies and a 1.6% decline related to foreign currency. The components of that constant currency internal growth was internally generated sales increase of 7.6%, and acquisition growth was an additional 10.7%. And that 7.6% growth globally included 7.0% growth in North America and 10.8% growth internationally. I'd like to point out that the North American sales were highlighted by growth of more than 11% in our financial services businesses. These businesses include equipment and practice financing, credit card practicing, practice brokerage, patient collections and other services. Internationally, the technology sales growth was driven primarily by increased software services. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market. Specifically we repurchased 1.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $163.62, and that is approximately $193 million. As I said earlier, the impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter EPS was about $0.01 favorable.
Our share repurchase program demonstrates our long-term commitment to create further value for shareholders and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. In line with this, we increased share repurchases in the third quarter at a greater rate than prior quarters.
Also, on October 19, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of an additional $400 million of shares of the company's common stock. That's in addition to the program that was announced in December of '15, and we have completed the purchase of that December '15 repurchase program. 
Again, we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $178.1 million. That compares to $107.4 million last year. And again, we believe that strong cash flow will continue for the balance of the year.
Our DSO, or day sales outstanding and accounts receivable, was up slightly to 42.4 days for the  current versus 40.6 days last year. And inventory turns, the other key metric, was 5.6 turns. And that's relatively unchanged from last year, which was 5.7 turns.
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing both our 2016 and 2017 financial guidance. For 2016, we expect GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $6.11 to $6.16. That represents growth of 7% to 8% compared with the GAAP diluted EPS of $5.69 for 2015. Adjusting non-GAAP -- adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, excluding restructuring costs ranging from $0.42 to $0.46 per diluted share, is expected to be $6.55 to $6.60 for 2016. And that represents growth of 10% to 11% compared to the adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.96 for 2015.
I'd also like to note that a significant portion of our EPS in the current quarter in excess of the consensus estimates for the current quarter was impacted by favorable timing versus the fourth quarter. The 2016 guidance assumes Q4 adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS in the high single-digit to low double-digit range or in the high single-digit range on a GAAP basis. Guidance for 2016 GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact of potential future acquisitions, if any, or any restructuring costs. 
Henry Schein expects that the current restructuring activities to be completed this year in the fourth quarter. We expect restructuring costs in Q4 2016 to be $17 million to $22 million pretax or $0.15 to $0.19 per diluted share. I'll also point out that our 2016 guidance assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with the current levels. However, we believe that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, especially against the British pound. And remember that about 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollar.
I'll also just remind people that our results this year are on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So fiscal 2016 consists of 53 weeks. This extra week is in the last week of Q4 2016. And obviously, since that's a holiday week at the end of the year between Christmas and New Year's, sales are generally lower during that week. And we anticipate that the extra week will not materially add to our earnings since fixed expenses remain relatively constant. When we report Q4 results, we'll also provide information on the sales impact of that extra week.
Turning to next year, we're introducing 2017 financial guidance as follows. GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. Since we do not expect to incur any restructuring costs in 2017, there is no separate non-GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance will be the only guidance that we're reporting. And this guidance reflects 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year and 9% to 11% on a non-GAAP basis when using the non-GAAP numbers for the prior year and the midpoint of those non-GAAP numbers.
Similarly to the 2016 guidance, the 2017 guidance is for current operations, does not include any previously announced acquisitions or the potential impact of future acquisition. And again, I'll point out that we assume foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. 
So with that quick summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."
339447,405246534,1070125,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well",1381,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well in the third quarter with particular strength in the implant sales worldwide. 
While the dental consumable merchandise market continued to reflect somewhat slower-than-historic growth, it appears to be stable. Though not back to the levels we saw a couple of quarters ago, we believe that the soft U.S. dental market is more temporary as September sales growth accelerated although October was somewhat soft. We believe that October sales growth was negatively impacted by the weather in certain areas of the country.
I would note that we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable EPS growth even during soft market conditions. North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies is 13.3% during the quarter. Why, shall I say? Sales of high-tech equipment with strong CAD/CAM and Zahn Custom Automated Prosthetic product sales experienced double-digit year-over-year internal growth in local currencies. Note that equipment growth benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales growth associated in part with a promotion in the quarter. 
Favorable dental equipment purchases are typically a leading indicator of dental practitioner sentiment. We do believe that the third quarter equipment sales in North America, coupled with the potential benefit from the Section 179 tax incentive, indicate that current market slowness may not prevail over the long term. That said, we are still closely monitoring industry data points as they become available in order to gauge the growth of the dental end market in North America. We would like to see additional future market data to draw any firm conclusion on sales trends. 
As we implement initiatives to expand digital dentistry in North America and abroad, we are pleased to report that sales of our digital impression solutions continue to be strong. Year-over-year, quarterly sales, once again, grew in double digits for our global prosthetic solutions business worldwide. We have an excellent product offering with scanners from PlanScan, 3shape and 3M in North America, Australia and New Zealand, supported by a software platform that features all-in-one capabilities and open architecture. This allows dentists to choose the best technology for their practice. 
In Europe, we are the leading distributor of ceramic [ph] dental equipment. We are playing an important role in educating dental practitioners on the benefits of CAD/CAM technology and integrated digital workflows. And we are well positioned as the market adoption continues to evolve.
As I mentioned, sales of dental specialty products, which include implants, orthodontics and endodontics, did well this quarter. In particular, we posted low double-digit worldwide sales growth with dental implants. Today, we are well positioned to leverage the attractive opportunities in these fast-growing markets with high-margin products. Our dental specialty product offering is highly synergistic with our core dental business, as an increasing number of general petitioners are now performing more specialty procedures themselves rather than referring them out. It is our goal to capitalize on our relationships with these GPs, these general petitioners, and help their practices generate new sources of revenue while providing with their customers, their patients with a great quality of service and clinical value to their patients.
Finally, with respect to our Dental business. During the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire an 80% ownership position in Marrodent, one of Poland's largest full-service dental distributors with 2015 sales of approximately $32 million. Marrodent marks the company's entry into the Poland dental market, opening opportunities for approximately 20,000 dental offices to do business with us and building upon our presence following our 2014 entry into the animal health market in Poland, which has proven to be most successful for the company. 
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. We look forward to serving the Polish dental community with the same high standards of commitment to efficiency and success that customers throughout the world have come to expect from Henry Schein, helping our new Polish customers operate a more efficient practice so that they can, in the end, provide better quality care to their patients.
Now let me touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results for agency switches, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.6% in North America. International sales through the third quarter were up 11% in local currencies, with 7.2% internal growth complemented by our strategic acquisitions, including KRUUSE in Denmark and Vetbook [ph] in Australia. We believe the animal health markets in U.S. and abroad are healthy and continue to grow. With our focus on the companion animal segment in the U.S., we see significant opportunities to expand our market share by servicing all the practices' needs of office space that veterinarians with products and related services, including our software to address their clinical diagnostic and reference lab requirements. 
We do have an excellent portfolio of products and services that is arguably the deepest in the industry. Our Practice Management and Axis-Q software solutions offer robust clinical integration features to connect with diagnostic systems, capture revenue and help practice operate efficiency.
Our goal is to help animal health practitioners operate a more efficient practice so that they, too, can provide better quality care. We continue to believe we are making good progress in executing on our diagnostic sales strategy and are very pleased also with the performance of our global Animal Health group.
Let me now turn to our Medical group. We believe our Medical sales growth of 7.1%, all internally generated, was well in excess of the broader market and reflects our ability to increase market share as we capitalize on our exposure to large group practices, including IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We continue to benefit from trends associated with Affordable Care Act in the U.S. as there are more covered lives and more procedures moving from the hospital setting to the general petitioner offices.
And the office petitioner, of course, is our primary customer. We believe our Medical businesses can grow at a healthy rate in the high single-digits in a market that is currently growing in the low single digits or even potentially less.
I'll conclude my business overview with Technology and Value-Added Services. We are pleased with the third quarter performance of these businesses as we are with our other groups. Internal growth in local currencies were 7% in North America and 10.8% in our international business. North American sales were highlighted by growth of over 11% in financial services business, while international growth was primarily driven by software revenue. Strategic acquisitions contribute to growth in local currencies of nearly 18% in North America, including the contribution of VetStreet and growth of more than 21% internationally, driven by RxWorks.
Our technology offerings are key elements to our total solutions platform at Henry Schein. Technology will be a critical enabler of more efficient patient-friendly practices. We are investing in the development of products that will help our better -- us better service and grow our installed base. Lots of exciting activity going on in the technology group. Our next generations of solutions will be ready to meet the requirements of faster and easy access to data, the sharing of workflow in the cloud and streamlined communication with patients. Interoperability with devices will also play a big role here and really, really doing great work in this part of the business.
So before we take your questions, I would like to make a few remarks about the future strategic initiatives of the company. We're beginning the process to develop the 2018, 2020 strategic plan. In keeping with our focus of providing value-added solutions to our customers, this plan will build on our foundation of delivery high-margin products, software and services that help petitioners drive more successful, more profitable businesses while providing the best-in-quality care. The combination of practice efficiency and providing quality care are the hallmark of the Henry Schein value-added services offering, that will play a key role and we center to our 2018 to '20 strategic plan.
So operator, with those comments, we are ready to open the call for questions."

In our view, the soft U.S. dental consumable market is more temporary, in our view again, as September sales growth accelerated. Now just to be clear, it -- we're talking with about hundreds of basis points, even less than that, swings. So it is hard to measure this impact on a month-to-month basis. September was strong, October was soft. We believe the October sales growth was negatively impacted by weather in certain areas in the market -- in the country. When I say soft, I mean relatively soft in terms of basis points, small numbers of basis points. It is still, in our view, too early to conclude whether the market will experience a more significant rebound. But it's really important to note that our U.S. dental equipment and our specialty product sales were strong during the quarter. By the way, our Canadian business is also strong, so that impacts the North American performance as well. We believe that the U.S. dental equipment positive trends are positive market indicators. So overall, the U.S. dental market is solid, probably flat from a unit point of view, very hard to tell. There are some units that are up in the specialty areas, and there's also some price compression because of perhaps competitiveness of 1 or 2 product categories. But overall, the market is solid and very hard to make concrete, long-term decisions on trends based on 1 week's performance over another. But we believe dentists would not be investing in their practices if they didn't feel good about the practices. By the way, we do continue to feel very good about our global Animal Health business, our U.S. Medical business, our international Dental business. And overall, we do feel very confident that we are gaining market share across all of our portfolios throughout the world. So it's a long answer to a short question."

In particular, our software that we offer, the interoperability of that software with various devices, our e-commerce platform, these are all unique. So given that array of value-added software or value-added offering and coupled with the prices that perhaps are being offered from time to time by competitors, we believe we have a very good offering.

And again, all 3 of those, we wanted to point out that while it was still a strong quarter, what was some favorable timing things that helped Q3 and will reverse in Q4. On your second question, Jeff, we -- I think you know that starting in June, the markets saw -- and we were unfortunately the first to talk about it on our conference call. The U.S. dental market showed softness. We saw that softness really continue June, July and August at different rates, but not materially different rates. September was a very strong month from us. We were beginning to believe during September -- and I'm talking about consumable merchandise in the U.S. dental market specifically. We were beginning to believe that it was really just related to the summer and vacations for practices or patients, but it was very strong. And then October was not as strong. It was still a bit better than what we saw earlier. But geographically, you had the hurricane impact that negatively impacted things. You had the ADA trade show that was in a different quarter than last year, that negatively impacted. So we still believe that October is potentially an indicator of positive signs. But as Stanley said, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. We would like to see some future data points. Equipment sales, we would expect to be strong again because of Section 179 in Q4. Stanley also highlighted specialty sales. To give you specific on that, specifically on dental implants -- and I think everyone knows dental implants, typically, because they're high-priced products and high-priced procedures and very little insurance coverage, when patients are more conscious of their spend, typically, that's something that shows weakness earlier. But again, we had very strong dental implants sales. We had double-digit sales growth globally and even slightly higher than that in the U.S. market. So I think both the equipment and the specialty sales are indicators that the market is stable and has potential. But we're still being cautious. Don't have that perfect crystal ball."

So I'd be interested to hear from you just kind of how do you think the next 3 to 5 years in the dental market, how are you going to compete differently than maybe you have over the last 3 to 5 to maybe even 10 years. Obviously, DSOs have grown to be a bigger part of the North American market. Rumors out there that maybe some other competitors are trying to get into the North American dental consumable side of the market in that. So just how do you think you have to change the way you compete over the next 3 to 5 years?"

I think we have to, of course, add to the value-added service proposition of Henry Schein. We have many business units that are offering different componentry to the dental market, whether it's products, specialty products, whether it is value-added services, software, e-commerce, different kinds of services from an education point of view, from practice transitions point of view, from a relationship with schools. We need to go out into the marketplace much more with a one-stop proposition to our customers, including leveraging our businesses outside of Dental, namely Medical and to some extent, veterinary because they also are dealing with some of the schools and some of the institutions. So what we need to be doing is going out far more with a one-stop value-added service proposition. We are well positioned. I don't believe anyone has the array of services that we have and particularly, on a global basis. We need to globalize more of our value-added services, be it in the digital prosthetic field or in the software field. And interoperability will be key. So these are the various areas that we will focus on. Your last sentence about additional competition coming into our market with large accounts, I think that's what you implied, I don't think anything has changed there. There's been a lot of competition in that space. There will always be competition in that space. More of the business will go into the very large accounts, but more will go into the midsized accounts. And I believe that in our strategic vision for the future, we will focus on separate value-added service propositions with different sectors of the market: the very large, the mid-market and the small. And these will be global propositions because it's the same trend that we're seeing around the world, and our value-added service offering will be globalized. Yes, they will be customized to specific market needs, but there'd be strategic thinking behind these offerings. And the services that we will develop or expanded services that we will develop will be utilizing global resources and global solutions, so -- with some customization for local needs. So we're very excited about the opportunities we have to further advance our value-added service propositions for specific sectors based on size of the customer and adding to that the various value-added service solutions from a specialty point of view as well."

Price has been an issue in our markets for the 36 years that I've been in the business. So yes, price is important, but you have to balance price with value-added services. It costs money to develop value-added services. It costs money to field the sales force, although both the value-added services and the field source -- or field force need to be more efficient. They need to have more sales per head, and they need to have more sales per dollar invested in value-added services. So the combination of investment in the value-added services and price is what drives competition and the bottom line. We obviously have to sharpen that, as we have done everything single year for decades. We have to sharpen, at the end of today, the price we charge for the value-added service and the products. Competition has always been there, so I'm not sure if there's anything new in the market other than we have to just continue with what we've done for decades, which is to provide a better proposition to our customers. I'm confident that we are well positioned to do that as we bring together our various offerings into a unified offering for our customer base."

But many time, customers are not ordering out of inventory. So it's directly related to more the consumable side. I would say that the better measurement is looking at inventory turns, and that's been consistent. And our goal, quite frankly, is to improve turns over the next year or 2. There's still opportunities in the market from time to time to do small forward buying, so we take advantage of that where it's financially smart to do so. Typically, we're not buying forward any significant period of time. We're deal with 4 to 6 weeks, so it's very short-term buys.

And I guess, John, the thing that we believe will be positive for us is this whole Section 179, where practices can deduct up to $500,000 of CapEx. And we believe that'll drive additional equipment sales growth in Q4. We've been saying that all year. But quite frankly, it's really hard to estimate with precision how much of that will occur.

We are pleased to report record financial results for the third quarter. We believe we gained market share in each of our business groups as the company continues to be well served by our diversified portfolio and an expanding global customer base. 
Today, we are affirming guidance for 2016 GAAP diluted EPS growth of 7% to 8% or 10% to 11% on an adjusted non-GPA (sic) [non-GAAP] basis. We are also pleased to introduce guidance for 2017 diluted EPS that represents growth of 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis or growth on a 9% to 11% basis -- on an adjusted non-GPA (sic) [non-GAAP] basis, both compared with respective midpoints of 2016 guidance.
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent business performance and accomplishments. But to set the tone, we remain very pleased with the state of the company, with our continued market share growth throughout the world and believe we are operating in very good markets. 
So Steven, please provide your financial report."
339447,405246534,1070575,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 m",2161,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Also, our prior year third quarter results include a onetime income tax benefit net of controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable tax ruling.
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes the restructuring costs and the prior year tax benefit as we believe the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling comparison of financial results between prior periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for a greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see in Exhibit B of this morning's earnings release a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
So first, turning to our sales results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 24, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 6.7% increase compared with the prior year's third quarter. And this consists of 7.7% growth in constant currency and a 1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.0%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%. When further normalizing our results for switches between agency sales and direct sales, that internal sales growth in local currencies for Q3 was 5.6%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings release.
We go to operating margin, on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2016 was 7.0%. And that was a contraction of 3 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2015. There are 3 key items that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 17 basis points. The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and the related expenses for those acquisitions as well as the switches between agency sales and direct sales. They, combined, negatively impacted the contraction by 14 basis points. Second, flu vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, and that negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points. This was offset by the third item that was related to a decrease in restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, and that favorably impacted the contraction by 12 basis points. So when you net out those 3 items, the net impact of 3 -- these items, our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis expanded by 14 basis points.
If you look at our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 28.9%. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, it was slightly lower at 28.7%. This compares with an adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.6% for the third quarter. As you'll recall, we had a favorable tax audit that we discussed last quarter that allowed us to reduce our overall ongoing effective tax rate, and we expect next quarter the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the same 28% range that we're showing this quarter.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis was $133.7 million or $1.63 per diluted share, representing increases of 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively, both compared with last year. Excluding these structuring costs, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter was $137.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, compared with last year, also on a non-GAAP basis. 
I think it's important to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.01, and that was offset by share repurchases, which benefited by about the same approximate $0.01. So they kind of netted each other out.
Let me provide some additional details on sales by business group. Dental sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 5.6% growth in local currencies and a 0.5% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%.
Looking at North America, the North American internal growth in local currencies was 4.4%, and that included 1.8% growth in sale of dental consumable merchandise products and 13.3% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. I'd like to point out that the dental equipment revenue benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales from Q4 into Q3, and that was associated in part with some promotional activities that occurred in the third quarter. 
I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals that we discussed last quarter. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental merchandise sales during the current quarter by approximately 50 basis points, and that'll continue to impact our merchandise sales growth for the next 2 quarters until fully annualized. Our annual sales of precious metals in the prior year was approximately $14 million. And again, that won't reoccur in 2016 or going forward.
Our international internal growth in local currencies of our dental group was 3.1% and included 2.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 4.2% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. On an overall basis, we believe we outpaced the global dental market for the current quarter, and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remains strong.
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales was $790.3 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.9%. The components include growth of 10.6% in constant currencies and 2.7% decline related to foreign currency. Internal sales in local currencies grew 8.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 2.0% to our growth. That 8.6% internal growth in constant currencies consisted of 10.0% growth in North America and 7.2% growth internationally. The normalized impact of Animal Health results, which again accounts for the switching of products from agency to direct sales, that 8.6% internal growth in local currencies reflects a 6.9% growth, including 6.6% in North America. Again, this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. We believe these were solid results, and we believe we continue to gain market share, both domestically and overseas in Animal Health.
Turning to Medical. Medical sales was $639.6 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.1%, which is all internally generated. There's no material impact of sales growth related to foreign currency for this business, and the components of that 7.1% included growth of 7.4% in North America and a slight decline of 0.9% internationally. Again, we're pleased with the Medical growth, and we believe we gained market share also in the medical market.
Last, turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $104.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. That included 18.3% growth in constant currencies and a 1.6% decline related to foreign currency. The components of that constant currency internal growth was internally generated sales increase of 7.6%, and acquisition growth was an additional 10.7%. And that 7.6% growth globally included 7.0% growth in North America and 10.8% growth internationally. I'd like to point out that the North American sales were highlighted by growth of more than 11% in our financial services businesses. These businesses include equipment and practice financing, credit card practicing, practice brokerage, patient collections and other services. Internationally, the technology sales growth was driven primarily by increased software services. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market. Specifically we repurchased 1.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $163.62, and that is approximately $193 million. As I said earlier, the impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter EPS was about $0.01 favorable.
Our share repurchase program demonstrates our long-term commitment to create further value for shareholders and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. In line with this, we increased share repurchases in the third quarter at a greater rate than prior quarters.
Also, on October 19, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of an additional $400 million of shares of the company's common stock. That's in addition to the program that was announced in December of '15, and we have completed the purchase of that December '15 repurchase program. 
Again, we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $178.1 million. That compares to $107.4 million last year. And again, we believe that strong cash flow will continue for the balance of the year.
Our DSO, or day sales outstanding and accounts receivable, was up slightly to 42.4 days for the  current quarter versus 40.6 days last year. And inventory turns, the other key metric, was 5.6 turns. And that's relatively unchanged from last year, which was 5.7 turns.
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing both our 2016 and 2017 financial guidance. For 2016, we expect GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $6.11 to $6.16. That represents growth of 7% to 8% compared with the GAAP diluted EPS of $5.69 for 2015. Adjusting non-GAAP -- adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, excluding the restructuring costs ranging from $0.42 to $0.46 per diluted share, is expected to be $6.55 to $6.60 for 2016. And that represents growth of 10% to 11% compared to the adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.96 for 2015.
I'd also like to note that a significant portion of our EPS in the current quarter in excess of the consensus estimates for the current quarter was impacted by favorable timing versus the fourth quarter. The 2016 guidance assumes Q4 adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS in the high single-digit to low double-digit range or in the high single-digit range on a GAAP basis. Guidance for 2016 GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact of potential future acquisitions, if any, or any restructuring costs. 
Henry Schein expects that the current restructuring activities to be completed this year in the fourth quarter. We expect restructuring costs in Q4 2016 to be $17 million to $22 million pretax or $0.15 to $0.19 per diluted share. I'll also point out that our 2016 guidance assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with the current levels. However, we believe that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, especially against the British pound. And remember that about 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
I'll also just remind people that our results this year are on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So fiscal 2016 consists of 53 weeks. This extra week is in the last week of Q4 2016. And obviously, since that's a holiday week at the end of the year between Christmas and New Year's, sales are generally lower during that week. And we anticipate that the extra week will not materially add to our earnings since fixed expenses remain relatively constant. When we report Q4 results, we'll also provide information on the sales impact of that extra week.
Turning to next year, we're introducing 2017 financial guidance as follows. GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. Since we do not expect to incur any restructuring costs in 2017, there is no separate non-GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance will be the only guidance that we're reporting. And this guidance reflects 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year and 9% to 11% on a non-GAAP basis when using the non-GAAP numbers for the prior year and the midpoint of those non-GAAP numbers.
Similarly to the 2016 guidance, the 2017 guidance is for current operations, does not include any previously announced acquisitions or the potential impact of future acquisitions. And again, I'll point out that we assume foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. 
So with that quick summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."
339447,405246534,1070575,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well",1384,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well in the third quarter with particular strength in the implant sales worldwide. 
While the dental consumable merchandise market continued to reflect somewhat slower-than-historic growth, it appears to be stable. Though not back to the levels we saw a couple of quarters ago, we believe that the soft U.S. dental market is more temporary as September sales growth accelerated although October was somewhat soft. We believe that October sales growth was negatively impacted by the weather in certain areas of the country.
I would note that we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable EPS growth even during soft market conditions. North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies is 13.3% during the quarter. Why, shall I say? Sales of high-tech equipment with strong CAD/CAM and Zahn Custom Automated Prosthetic product sales experienced double-digit year-over-year internal growth in local currencies. Note that equipment growth benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales growth associated in part with a promotion in the quarter. 
Favorable dental equipment purchases are typically a leading indicator of dental practitioner sentiment. We do believe that the third quarter equipment sales in North America, coupled with the potential benefit from the Section 179 tax incentive, indicate that current market slowness may not prevail over the long term. That said, we are still closely monitoring industry data points as they become available in order to gauge the growth of the dental end market in North America. We would like to see additional future market data to draw any firm conclusion on sales trends. 
As we implement initiatives to expand digital dentistry in North America and abroad, we are pleased to report that sales of our digital impression solutions continue to be strong. Year-over-year, quarterly sales once again grew in double digits for our global prosthetic solutions business worldwide. We have an excellent product offering with scanners from PlanScan, 3shape and 3M in North America, Australia and New Zealand, supported by a software platform that features all-in-one capabilities and open architecture. This allows dentists to choose the best technology for their practice. 
In Europe, we are the leading distributor of ceramic [ph] dental equipment. We are playing an important role in educating dental practitioners on the benefits of CAD/CAM technology and integrated digital workflows. And we are well positioned as the market adoption continues to evolve.
As I mentioned, sales of dental specialty products, which include implants, orthodontics and endodontics, did well this quarter. In particular, we posted low double-digit worldwide sales growth with dental implants. Today, we are well positioned to leverage the attractive opportunities in these fast-growing markets with high-margin products. Our dental specialty product offering is highly synergistic with our core dental business, as an increasing number of general practitioners are now performing more specialty procedures themselves rather than referring them out. It is our goal to capitalize on our relationships with these GPs, these general practitioners, and help their practices generate new sources of revenue while providing with -- their customers, their patients with a great quality of service and clinical value to their patients.
Finally, with respect to our Dental business. During the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire an 80% ownership position in Marrodent, one of Poland's largest full-service dental distributors with 2015 sales of approximately $32 million. Marrodent marks the company's entry into the Poland dental market, opening opportunities for approximately 20,000 dental offices to do business with us and building upon a presence following our 2014 entry into the animal health market in Poland, which has proven to be most successful for the company. 
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. We look forward to serving the Polish dental community with the same high standards of commitment to efficiency and success that customers throughout the world have come to expect from Henry Schein, helping our new Polish customers operate a more efficient practice so that they can, in the end, provide better quality care to their patients.
Now let me touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results for agency switches, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.6% in North America. International sales through the third quarter were up 11% in local currencies, with 7.2% internal growth complemented by our strategic acquisitions, including KRUUSE in Denmark and Vet Group [ph] in Australia. We believe the animal markets in the U.S. and abroad are healthy and continue to grow. With our focus on the companion animal segment in the U.S., we see significant opportunities to expand our market share by servicing all the practices' needs of office space that veterinarians with products and related services, including our software to address their clinical diagnostic and reference lab requirements. 
We do have an excellent portfolio of products and services that is arguably the deepest in the industry. Our Practice Management and Axis-Q software solutions offer robust clinical integration features to connect with diagnostic systems, capture revenue and help practice operate efficiency.
Our goal is to help animal health practitioners operate a more efficient practice so that they, too, can provide better quality care. We continue to believe we are making good progress in executing on our diagnostic sales strategy and are very pleased also with the performance of our global Animal Health group.
Let me now turn to our Medical group. We believe our Medical sales growth of 7.1%, all internally generated, was well in excess of the broader market and reflects our ability to increase market share as we capitalize on our exposure to large group practices, including IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We continue to benefit from trends associated with Affordable Care Act in the U.S. as there are more covered lives and more procedures moving from the hospital setting to the general practitioner offices.
And the office practitioner, of course, is our primary customer. We believe our Medical businesses can grow at a healthy rate in the high single-digits in a market that is currently growing in the low single digits or even potentially less.
I'll conclude my business overview with Technology and Value-Added Services. We are pleased with the third quarter performance of these businesses as we are with our other groups. Internal sales growth in local currencies were 7% in North America and 10.8% in our international business. North American sales were highlighted by growth of over 11% in financial services business, while international growth was primarily driven by software revenue. Strategic acquisitions contribute to growth in local currencies of nearly 18% in North America, including the contribution of VetStreet and growth of more than 21% internationally, driven by RxWorks. 
Our technology offerings are key elements to our total solutions platform at Henry Schein. Technology will be a critical enabler of more efficient patient-friendly practices. We are investing in the development of products that will help our better -- us better service and grow our installed base. Lots of exciting activity going on in the technology group. Our next generations of solutions will be ready to meet the requirements of faster and easier access to data, the sharing of workflow in the cloud and streamlined communication with patients. Interoperability with devices will also play a big role here and really, really doing great work in this part of the business.
So before we take your questions, I would like to make a few remarks about the future strategic initiatives of the company. We're beginning the process to develop the 2018, 2020 strategic plan. In keeping with our focus of providing value-added solutions to our customers, this plan will build on our foundation of delivering high-margin products, software and services that help petitioners drive more successful, more profitable businesses while providing the best-in-quality care. The combination of practice efficiency and providing quality care are the hallmark of the Henry Schein value-added services offering, that will play a key role and we center to our 2018 to '20 strategic plan.
So operator, with those comments, we are ready to open the call for questions."

In our view, the soft U.S. dental consumable market is more temporary, in our view again, as September sales growth accelerated. Now just to be clear, it -- we're talking with about hundreds of basis points, even less than that, swings. So it is hard to measure this impact on a month-to-month basis. September was strong, October was soft. We believe the October sales growth was negatively impacted by weather in certain areas in the market -- in the country. When I say soft, I mean relatively soft in terms of basis points, small numbers of basis points. It is still, in our view, too early to conclude whether the market will experience a more significant rebound. But it's really important to note that our U.S. dental equipment and our specialty product sales were strong during the quarter. By the way, our Canadian business is also strong, so that impacts the North American performance as well. We believe that the U.S. dental equipment positive trends are positive market indicators. So overall, the U.S. dental market is solid, probably flat from a unit point of view, very hard to tell. There are some units that are up in the specialty areas, and there's also some price compression because of perhaps competitiveness of 1 or 2 product categories. But overall, the market is solid and very hard to make concrete, long-term decisions on trends based on one week's performance over another. But we believe dentists would not be investing in their practices if they didn't feel good about the practices. By the way, we do continue to feel very good about our global Animal Health business, our U.S. Medical business, our international Dental business. And overall, we do feel very confident that we are gaining market share across all of our portfolios throughout the world. So it's a long answer to a short question."

You have 13% growth in the current quarter, but some of that did pull forward from Q4. The second is favorable timing on influenza vaccine sales. I think as most people know, we can't control sales between Q3 and Q4. And we just had stronger versus last year. We had stronger sales growth in the current quarter versus last year's current quarter -- the last year's third quarter. And the last is it's some timing of some expenses. And again, all 3 of those, we wanted to point out that while it was still a strong quarter, what was some favorable timing things that helped Q3 and will reverse in Q4. On your second question, Jeff, we -- I think you know that starting in June, the markets saw -- and we were unfortunately the first to talk about it on our conference call. The U.S. dental market showed softness. We saw that softness really continue June, July and August at different rates, but not materially different rates. September was a very strong month from us. We were beginning to believe during September -- and I'm talking about consumable merchandise in the U.S. dental market specifically. We were beginning to believe that it was really just related to the summer and vacations for practices or patients, but it was very strong. And then October was not as strong. It was still a bit better than what we saw earlier. But geographically, you had the hurricane impact that negatively impacted things. You had the ADA trade show that was in a different quarter than last year, that negatively impacted. So we still believe that October is potentially an indicator of positive signs. But as Stanley said, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. We would like to see some future data points. Equipment sales, we would expect to be strong again because of Section 179 in Q4. Stanley also highlighted specialty sales. To give you a specific on that, specifically on dental implants -- and I think everyone knows dental implants, typically, because they're high-priced products and high-priced procedures and very little insurance coverage. When patients are more conscious of their spend, typically, that's something that shows weakness earlier. But again, we had very strong dental implant sales. We had double-digit sales growth globally and even slightly higher than that in the U.S. market. So I think both the equipment and the specialty sales are indicators that the market is stable and has potential. But we're still being cautious. Don't have that perfect crystal ball."

So I'd be interested to hear from you just kind of how do you think the next 3 to 5 years in the dental market, how are you going to have to compete differently than maybe you have over the last 3 to 5 to maybe even 10 years. Obviously, DSOs have grown to be a bigger part of the North American market. Rumors out there that maybe some other competitors are trying to get into the North American dental consumable side of the market in that. So just how do you think you have to change the way you compete over the next 3 to 5 years?"

I think we have to, of course, add to the value-added service proposition of Henry Schein. We have many business units that are offering different componentry to the dental market, whether it's products, specialty products, whether it is value-added services, software, e-commerce, different kinds of services from an education point of view, from practice transitions point of view, from a relationship with schools. We need to go out into the marketplace much more with a one-stop proposition to our customers, including leveraging our businesses outside of Dental, namely Medical and to some extent, veterinary because they also are dealing with some of the schools and some of the institutions. So what we need to be doing is going out far more with a one-stop value-added service proposition. We are well positioned. I don't believe anyone has the array of services that we have and particularly, on a global basis. We need to globalize more of our value-added services, be it in the digital prosthetic field or in the software field. And interoperability will be key. So these are the various areas that we will focus on. Your last sentence about additional competition coming into our market with large accounts, I think that's what you implied, I don't think anything has changed there. There's been a lot of competition in that space. There will always be competition in that space. More of the business will go into the very large accounts, but more will go into the midsized accounts. And I believe that in our strategic vision for the future, we will focus on separate value-added service propositions with different sectors of the market: the very large, the mid-market and the small. And these will be global propositions because it's the same trend that we're seeing around the world, and our value-added service offerings will be globalized. Yes, they will be customized to specific market needs, but there'd be strategic thinking behind these offerings. And the services that we will develop or expanded services that we will develop will be utilizing global resources and global solutions, so -- with some customization for local needs. So we're very excited about the opportunities we have to further advance our value-added service propositions for specific sectors based on size of the customer and adding to that the various value-added service solutions from a specialty point of view as well."

Price has been an issue in our markets for the 36 years that I've been in the business. So yes, price is important, but you have to balance price with value-added services. It costs money to develop value-added services. It costs money to field the sales force, although both the value-added services and the field source -- or field force needs to be more efficient. We need to have more sales per head, and we need to have more sales per dollar invested in value-added services. So the combination of investment in the value-added services and price is what drives competition and the bottom line. We obviously have to sharpen that, as we have done every single year for decades. We have to sharpen, at the end of the day, the price we charge for the value-added service and the products. Competition has always been there, so I'm not sure if there's anything new in the market other than we have to just continue with what we've done for decades, which is to provide a better proposition to our customers. I'm confident that we are well positioned to do that as we bring together our various offerings into a unified offering for our customer base."

But many times, customers are not ordering out of inventory. So it's directly related to more the consumable side. I would say that the better measurement is looking at inventory turns, and that's been consistent. And our goal, quite frankly, is to improve turns over the next year or 2. There's still opportunities in the market from time to time to do small forward buying, so we take advantage of that where it's financially smart to do so. Typically, we're not buying forward any significant period of time. We're dealing with 4 to 6 weeks, so it's very short-term buys.

And we believe that'll drive additional equipment sales growth in Q4. We've been saying that all year. But quite frankly, it's really hard to estimate with precision how much of that will occur.

As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 m",2161,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2016 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $5.4 million pretax or $0.05 per diluted share. Our Q3 2015 results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Also, our prior year third quarter results include a onetime income tax benefit net of controlling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to a favorable tax ruling.
I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes the restructuring costs and the prior year tax benefit as we believe the adjusted non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling comparison of financial results between prior periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for a greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see in Exhibit B of this morning's earnings release a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
So first, turning to our sales results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 24, 2016, were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 6.7% increase compared with the prior year's third quarter. And this consists of 7.7% growth in constant currency and a 1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 6.0%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%. When further normalizing our results for switches between agency sales and direct sales, that internal sales growth in local currencies for Q3 was 5.6%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings release.
We go to operating margin, on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2016 was 7.0%. And that was a contraction of 3 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2015. There are 3 key items that negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 17 basis points. The first item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and the related expenses for those acquisitions as well as the switches between agency sales and direct sales. They, combined, negatively impacted the contraction by 14 basis points. Second, flu vaccine sales this year had a lower margin compared to the prior year, and that negatively impacted our operating margin by 15 basis points. This was offset by the third item that was related to a decrease in restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, and that favorably impacted the contraction by 12 basis points. So when you net out those 3 items, the net impact of 3 -- these items, our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis expanded by 14 basis points.
If you look at our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 28.9%. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, it was slightly lower at 28.7%. This compares with an adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.6% for the third quarter. As you'll recall, we had a favorable tax audit that we discussed last quarter that allowed us to reduce our overall ongoing effective tax rate, and we expect next quarter the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to be in the same 28% range that we're showing this quarter.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein on a GAAP basis was $133.7 million or $1.63 per diluted share, representing increases of 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively, both compared with last year. Excluding these structuring costs, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the third quarter was $137.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively, compared with last year, also on a non-GAAP basis. 
I think it's important to point out that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.01, and that was offset by share repurchases, which benefited by about the same approximate $0.01. So they kind of netted each other out.
Let me provide some additional details on sales by business group. Dental sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% to $1.3 billion. This consisted of 5.6% growth in local currencies and a 0.5% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 1.7%.
Looking at North America, the North American internal growth in local currencies was 4.4%, and that included 1.8% growth in sale of dental consumable merchandise products and 13.3% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenues. I'd like to point out that the dental equipment revenue benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales from Q4 into Q3, and that was associated in part with some promotional activities that occurred in the third quarter. 
I'd also like to reiterate that our growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals that we discussed last quarter. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental merchandise sales during the current quarter by approximately 50 basis points, and that'll continue to impact our merchandise sales growth for the next 2 quarters until fully annualized. Our annual sales of precious metals in the prior year was approximately $14 million. And again, that won't reoccur in 2016 or going forward.
Our international internal growth in local currencies of our dental group was 3.1% and included 2.7% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 4.2% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. On an overall basis, we believe we outpaced the global dental market for the current quarter, and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remains strong.
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales was $790.3 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.9%. The components include growth of 10.6% in constant currencies and 2.7% decline related to foreign currency. Internal sales in local currencies grew 8.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 2.0% to our growth. That 8.6% internal growth in constant currencies consisted of 10.0% growth in North America and 7.2% growth internationally. The normalized impact of Animal Health results, which again accounts for the switching of products from agency to direct sales, that 8.6% internal growth in local currencies reflects a 6.9% growth, including 6.6% in North America. Again, this normalized growth rate is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. We believe these were solid results, and we believe we continue to gain market share, both domestically and overseas in Animal Health.
Turning to Medical. Medical sales was $639.6 million for the third quarter. That's an increase of 7.1%, which is all internally generated. There's no material impact of sales growth related to foreign currency for this business, and the components of that 7.1% included growth of 7.4% in North America and a slight decline of 0.9% internationally. Again, we're pleased with the Medical growth, and we believe we gained market share also in the medical market.
Last, turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $104.7 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. That included 18.3% growth in constant currencies and a 1.6% decline related to foreign currency. The components of that constant currency internal growth was internally generated sales increase of 7.6%, and acquisition growth was an additional 10.7%. And that 7.6% growth globally included 7.0% growth in North America and 10.8% growth internationally. I'd like to point out that the North American sales were highlighted by growth of more than 11% in our financial services businesses. These businesses include equipment and practice financing, credit card practicing, practice brokerage, patient collections and other services. Internationally, the technology sales growth was driven primarily by increased software services. 
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase common stock in the open market. Specifically we repurchased 1.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $163.62, and that is approximately $193 million. As I said earlier, the impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter EPS was about $0.01 favorable.
Our share repurchase program demonstrates our long-term commitment to create further value for shareholders and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. In line with this, we increased share repurchases in the third quarter at a greater rate than prior quarters.
Also, on October 19, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of an additional $400 million of shares of the company's common stock. That's in addition to the program that was announced in December of '15, and we have completed the purchase of that December '15 repurchase program. 
Again, we continue to believe our capital allocation strategy, which deploys a large portion of our annual free cash flow to share repurchases and M&A activities, will continue to drive increased shareholder value. 
If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow, we had very strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $178.1 million. That compares to $107.4 million last year. And again, we believe that strong cash flow will continue for the balance of the year.
Our DSO, or day sales outstanding and accounts receivable, was up slightly to 42.4 days for the  current quarter versus 40.6 days last year. And inventory turns, the other key metric, was 5.6 turns. And that's relatively unchanged from last year, which was 5.7 turns.
Let me conclude my remarks by discussing both our 2016 and 2017 financial guidance. For 2016, we expect GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $6.11 to $6.16. That represents growth of 7% to 8% compared with the GAAP diluted EPS of $5.69 for 2015. Adjusting non-GAAP -- adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, excluding the restructuring costs ranging from $0.42 to $0.46 per diluted share, is expected to be $6.55 to $6.60 for 2016. And that represents growth of 10% to 11% compared to the adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.96 for 2015.
I'd also like to note that a significant portion of our EPS in the current quarter in excess of the consensus estimates for the current quarter was impacted by favorable timing versus the fourth quarter. The 2016 guidance assumes Q4 adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS in the high single-digit to low double-digit range or in the high single-digit range on a GAAP basis. Guidance for 2016 GAAP EPS and adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is, as always, for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact of potential future acquisitions, if any, or any restructuring costs. 
Henry Schein expects that the current restructuring activities to be completed this year in the fourth quarter. We expect restructuring costs in Q4 2016 to be $17 million to $22 million pretax or $0.15 to $0.19 per diluted share. I'll also point out that our 2016 guidance assumes foreign exchange rates that are generally consistent with the current levels. However, we believe that the U.S. dollar may continue to strengthen, especially against the British pound. And remember that about 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
I'll also just remind people that our results this year are on a 52-, 53-week basis ending on the last Saturday of December. So fiscal 2016 consists of 53 weeks. This extra week is in the last week of Q4 2016. And obviously, since that's a holiday week at the end of the year between Christmas and New Year's, sales are generally lower during that week. And we anticipate that the extra week will not materially add to our earnings since fixed expenses remain relatively constant. When we report Q4 results, we'll also provide information on the sales impact of that extra week.
Turning to next year, we're introducing 2017 financial guidance as follows. GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. Since we do not expect to incur any restructuring costs in 2017, there is no separate non-GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance will be the only guidance that we're reporting. And this guidance reflects 17% to 19% on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year and 9% to 11% on a non-GAAP basis when using the non-GAAP numbers for the prior year and the midpoint of those non-GAAP numbers.
Similarly to the 2016 guidance, the 2017 guidance is for current operations, does not include any previously announced acquisitions or the potential impact of future acquisitions. And again, I'll point out that we assume foreign exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels. 
So with that quick summary, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."
339447,405246534,1072730,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well",1384,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our 4 business groups with the Dental group. Our North American dental consumable merchandise growth in quarter 3 was relatively consistent with the quarter 2 growth. Sales of dental specialty products did well in the third quarter with particular strength in the implant sales worldwide. 
While the dental consumable merchandise market continued to reflect somewhat slower-than-historic growth, it appears to be stable. Though not back to the levels we saw a couple of quarters ago, we believe that the soft U.S. dental market is more temporary as September sales growth accelerated although October was somewhat soft. We believe that October sales growth was negatively impacted by the weather in certain areas of the country.
I would note that we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable EPS growth even during soft market conditions. North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies is 13.3% during the quarter. Why, shall I say? Sales of high-tech equipment with strong CAD/CAM and Zahn Custom Automated Prosthetic product sales experienced double-digit year-over-year internal growth in local currencies. Note that equipment growth benefited, to some extent, from an acceleration of sales growth associated in part with a promotion in the quarter. 
Favorable dental equipment purchases are typically a leading indicator of dental practitioner sentiment. We do believe that the third quarter equipment sales in North America, coupled with the potential benefit from the Section 179 tax incentive, indicate that current market slowness may not prevail over the long term. That said, we are still closely monitoring industry data points as they become available in order to gauge the growth of the dental end market in North America. We would like to see additional future market data to draw any firm conclusion on sales trends. 
As we implement initiatives to expand digital dentistry in North America and abroad, we are pleased to report that sales of our digital impression solutions continue to be strong. Year-over-year, quarterly sales once again grew in double digits for our global prosthetic solutions business worldwide. We have an excellent product offering with scanners from PlanScan, 3shape and 3M in North America, Australia and New Zealand, supported by a software platform that features all-in-one capabilities and open architecture. This allows dentists to choose the best technology for their practice. 
In Europe, we are the leading distributor of ceramic [ph] dental equipment. We are playing an important role in educating dental practitioners on the benefits of CAD/CAM technology and integrated digital workflows. And we are well positioned as the market adoption continues to evolve.
As I mentioned, sales of dental specialty products, which include implants, orthodontics and endodontics, did well this quarter. In particular, we posted low double-digit worldwide sales growth with dental implants. Today, we are well positioned to leverage the attractive opportunities in these fast-growing markets with high-margin products. Our dental specialty product offering is highly synergistic with our core dental business, as an increasing number of general practitioners are now performing more specialty procedures themselves rather than referring them out. It is our goal to capitalize on our relationships with these GPs, these general practitioners, and help their practices generate new sources of revenue while providing with -- their customers, their patients with a great quality of service and clinical value to their patients.
Finally, with respect to our Dental business. During the third quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire an 80% ownership position in Marrodent, one of Poland's largest full-service dental distributors with 2015 sales of approximately $32 million. Marrodent marks the company's entry into the Poland dental market, opening opportunities for approximately 20,000 dental offices to do business with us and building upon a presence following our 2014 entry into the animal health market in Poland, which has proven to be most successful for the company. 
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. We look forward to serving the Polish dental community with the same high standards of commitment to efficiency and success that customers throughout the world have come to expect from Henry Schein, helping our new Polish customers operate a more efficient practice so that they can, in the end, provide better quality care to their patients.
Now let me touch briefly on our Animal Health business. As Steven mentioned, when normalizing Animal Health results for agency switches, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.6% in North America. International sales through the third quarter were up 11% in local currencies, with 7.2% internal growth complemented by our strategic acquisitions, including KRUUSE in Denmark and Vet Group [ph] in Australia. We believe the animal markets in the U.S. and abroad are healthy and continue to grow. With our focus on the companion animal segment in the U.S., we see significant opportunities to expand our market share by servicing all the practices' needs of office space that veterinarians with products and related services, including our software to address their clinical diagnostic and reference lab requirements. 
We do have an excellent portfolio of products and services that is arguably the deepest in the industry. Our Practice Management and Axis-Q software solutions offer robust clinical integration features to connect with diagnostic systems, capture revenue and help practice operate efficiency.
Our goal is to help animal health practitioners operate a more efficient practice so that they, too, can provide better quality care. We continue to believe we are making good progress in executing on our diagnostic sales strategy and are very pleased also with the performance of our global Animal Health group.
Let me now turn to our Medical group. We believe our Medical sales growth of 7.1%, all internally generated, was well in excess of the broader market and reflects our ability to increase market share as we capitalize on our exposure to large group practices, including IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. We continue to benefit from trends associated with Affordable Care Act in the U.S. as there are more covered lives and more procedures moving from the hospital setting to the general practitioner offices.
And the office practitioner, of course, is our primary customer. We believe our Medical businesses can grow at a healthy rate in the high single-digits in a market that is currently growing in the low single digits or even potentially less.
I'll conclude my business overview with Technology and Value-Added Services. We are pleased with the third quarter performance of these businesses as we are with our other groups. Internal sales growth in local currencies were 7% in North America and 10.8% in our international business. North American sales were highlighted by growth of over 11% in financial services business, while international growth was primarily driven by software revenue. Strategic acquisitions contribute to growth in local currencies of nearly 18% in North America, including the contribution of VetStreet and growth of more than 21% internationally, driven by RxWorks. 
Our technology offerings are key elements to our total solutions platform at Henry Schein. Technology will be a critical enabler of more efficient patient-friendly practices. We are investing in the development of products that will help our better -- us better service and grow our installed base. Lots of exciting activity going on in the technology group. Our next generations of solutions will be ready to meet the requirements of faster and easier access to data, the sharing of workflow in the cloud and streamlined communication with patients. Interoperability with devices will also play a big role here and really, really doing great work in this part of the business.
So before we take your questions, I would like to make a few remarks about the future strategic initiatives of the company. We're beginning the process to develop the 2018, 2020 strategic plan. In keeping with our focus of providing value-added solutions to our customers, this plan will build on our foundation of delivering high-margin products, software and services that help petitioners drive more successful, more profitable businesses while providing the best-in-quality care. The combination of practice efficiency and providing quality care are the hallmark of the Henry Schein value-added services offering, that will play a key role and we center to our 2018 to '20 strategic plan.
So operator, with those comments, we are ready to open the call for questions."

In our view, the soft U.S. dental consumable market is more temporary, in our view again, as September sales growth accelerated. Now just to be clear, it -- we're talking with about hundreds of basis points, even less than that, swings. So it is hard to measure this impact on a month-to-month basis. September was strong, October was soft. We believe the October sales growth was negatively impacted by weather in certain areas in the market -- in the country. When I say soft, I mean relatively soft in terms of basis points, small numbers of basis points. It is still, in our view, too early to conclude whether the market will experience a more significant rebound. But it's really important to note that our U.S. dental equipment and our specialty product sales were strong during the quarter. By the way, our Canadian business is also strong, so that impacts the North American performance as well. We believe that the U.S. dental equipment positive trends are positive market indicators. So overall, the U.S. dental market is solid, probably flat from a unit point of view, very hard to tell. There are some units that are up in the specialty areas, and there's also some price compression because of perhaps competitiveness of 1 or 2 product categories. But overall, the market is solid and very hard to make concrete, long-term decisions on trends based on 1 week's performance over another. But we believe dentists would not be investing in their practices if they didn't feel good about the practices. By the way, we do continue to feel very good about our global Animal Health business, our U.S. Medical business, our international Dental business. And overall, we do feel very confident that we are gaining market share across all of our portfolios throughout the world. So it's a long answer to a short question."

In particular, our software that we offer, interoperability of that software with various devices, our e-commerce platform, these are all unique. So given that array of value-added software or value-added offering and coupled with the prices that perhaps are being offered from time to time by competitors, we believe we have a very good offering.

You have 13% growth in the current quarter, but some of that did pull forward from Q4. The second is favorable timing on influenza vaccine sales. I think as most people know, we can't control sales between Q3 and Q4. And we just had stronger versus last year. We had stronger sales growth in the current quarter versus last year's current quarter -- the last year's third quarter. And the last is it's some timing of some expenses. And again, all 3 of those, we wanted to point out that while it was still a strong quarter, what was some favorable timing things that helped Q3 and will reverse in Q4. On your second question, Jeff, we -- I think you know that starting in June, the markets saw -- and we were unfortunately the first to talk about it on our conference call. The U.S. dental market showed softness. We saw that softness really continue June, July and August at different rates, but not materially different rates. September was a very strong month from us. We were beginning to believe during September -- and I'm talking about consumable merchandise in the U.S. dental market specifically. We were beginning to believe that it was really just related to the summer and vacations for practices or patients, but it was very strong. And then October was not as strong. It was still a bit better than what we saw earlier. But geographically, you had the hurricane impact that negatively impacted things. You had the ADA trade show that was in a different quarter than last year, that negatively impacted. So we still believe that October is potentially an indicator of positive signs. But as Stanley said, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. We would like to see some future data points. Equipment sales, we would expect to be strong again because of Section 179 in Q4. Stanley also highlighted specialty sales. To give you a specific on that, specifically on dental implants -- and I think everyone knows dental implants, typically, because they're high-priced products and high-priced procedures and very little insurance coverage. When patients are more conscious of their spend, typically, that's something that shows weakness earlier. But again, we had very strong dental implant sales. We had double-digit sales growth globally and even slightly higher than that in the U.S. market. So I think both the equipment and the specialty sales are indicators that the market is stable and has potential. But we're still being cautious. Don't have that perfect crystal ball."

And then, Stanley, so bigger-picture question for you is, you guys have been great at kind of this long-term planning over the years, kind of laying out your 3-year plans as you're talking about 2018 to 2020 now but even the longer-term plans than that. So I'd be interested to hear from you just kind of how do you think the next 3 to 5 years in the dental market, how are you going to have to compete differently than maybe you have over the last 3 to 5 to maybe even 10 years. Obviously, DSOs have grown to be a bigger part of the North American market. Rumors out there that maybe some other competitors are trying to get into the North American dental consumable side of the market in that. So just how do you think you have to change the way you compete over the next 3 to 5 years?"

I think we have to, of course, add to the value-added service proposition of Henry Schein. We have many business units that are offering different componentry to the dental market, whether it's products, specialty products,",400,"Thank you, Jeff. Good question. I think we have to, of course, add to the value-added service proposition of Henry Schein. We have many business units that are offering different componentry to the dental market, whether it's products, specialty products, whether it is value-added services, software, e-commerce, different kinds of services from an education point of view, from practice transitions point of view, from a relationship with schools. We need to go out into the marketplace much more with a one-stop proposition to our customers, including leveraging our businesses outside of Dental, namely Medical and to some extent, veterinary because they also are dealing with some of the schools and some of the institutions. So what we need to be doing is going out far more with a one-stop value-added service proposition. We are well positioned. I don't believe anyone has the array of services that we have and particularly, on a global basis. We need to globalize more of our value-added services, be it in the digital prosthetic field or in the software field. And interoperability will be key. So these are the various areas that we will focus on. Your last sentence about additional competition coming into our market with large accounts, I think that's what you implied, I don't think anything has changed there. There's been a lot of competition in that space. There will always be competition in that space. More of the business will go into the very large accounts, but more will go into the midsized accounts. And I believe that in our strategic vision for the future, we will focus on separate value-added service propositions with different sectors of the market: the very large, the mid-market and the small. And these will be global propositions because it's the same trend that we're seeing around the world, and our value-added service offerings will be globalized. Yes, they will be customized to specific market needs, but there'd be strategic thinking behind these offerings. And the services that we will develop or expanded services that we will develop will be utilizing global resources and global solutions, so -- with some customization for local needs. So we're very excited about the opportunities we have to further advance our value-added service propositions for specific sectors based on size of the customer and adding to that the various value-added service solutions from a specialty point of view as well."

Price has been an issue in our markets for the 36 years that I've been in the business. So yes, price is important, but you have to balance price with value-added services. It costs money to develop value-added services. It costs money to field the sales force, although both the value-added services and the field source -- or field force needs to be more efficient. We need to have more sales per head, and we need to have more sales per dollar invested in value-added services. So the combination of investment in the value-added services and price is what drives competition and the bottom line. We obviously have to sharpen that, as we have done every single year for decades. We have to sharpen, at the end of the day, the price we charge for the value-added service and the products. Competition has always been there, so I'm not sure if there's anything new in the market other than we have to just continue with what we've done for decades, which is to provide a better proposition to our customers. I'm confident that we are well positioned to do that as we bring together our various offerings into a unified offering for our customer base."

But many times, customers are not ordering out of inventory. So it's directly related to more the consumable side. I would say that the better measurement is looking at inventory turns, and that's been consistent. And our goal, quite frankly, is to improve turns over the next year or 2. There's still opportunities in the market from time to time to do small forward buying, so we take advantage of that where it's financially smart to do so. Typically, we're not buying forward any significant period of time. We're dealing with 4 to 6 weeks, so it's very short-term buys.

And we believe that'll drive additional equipment sales growth in Q4. We've been saying that all year. But quite frankly, it's really hard to estimate with precision how much of that will occur.
