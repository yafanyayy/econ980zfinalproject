I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016.

I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016. Then I'll hand it over to Mark to review the fourth quarter in more detail and share some forward-looking guidance. 
Starting on Slide 3 of our earnings presentation, we reported fourth quarter net income of $500 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, up 31% due to some onetime charges in the prior year. We were able to drive our return on equity, up 18% for the quarter, despite higher loan loss provisions and higher nonrecurring expenses driven by the anti-money laundering look back. 
Turning to Slide 4. Discover achieved total loan growth of 3.5% over the prior year. Card receivables grew 3% this quarter, lower than we would like. However, this was partly due to lower promotional balance growth compared to the prior period. 
Total sales for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year or 5% excluding gas sales. Lower gas prices have continued to impact our sales and card loan growth more than we had anticipated. However, we believe that also somewhat helped credit results in 2015. 
Moving to our next largest asset class, private service loans grew 3%. However, excluding our acquired portfolios, we achieved 16% growth year-over-year. Personal loans increased to $5.5 billion[ph], up 10% from the prior year. 
On the right-hand side of Slide 4, we lay out Payments volume growth. Proprietary volume continued to increase in support of the card issuing business. However, our third-party Payments segment had lower volume compared to the prior year. A large part of the volume in the segment comes from PULSE where we saw a continued decline in the challenging post-Durbin environment. 
Performance was good in the other network businesses, although they represent a much smaller portion of the total Payments volume. Network Partners volume increased significantly driven by AribaPay volumes while Diners volume decreased slightly as reported, but was up nicely on a constant dollar basis. 
Now I'm going to touch on our full year financial results shown on Slide 5. In our 2015 -- in 2015, our earnings crossed the $5 per share mark for the first time. Revenue increased 3% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Moving down this slide, provision grew roughly in line with the average loan growth. Expense growth was primarily driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, particularly related to our AML consent order remediation. Due to the strength of our capital generation and buyback program, EPS increased 5% for the full year versus 2014. 
Moving to Slide 6, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 to move the business forward. We continued to grow our balance sheet with total loans up 3.5% from the prior year. We introduced new features and benefits throughout the year to attract and retain customers. 
In Card, we introduce the innovative Freeze It capability, which allows customers to suspend their credit card with a few clicks from their app in the event it's misplaced. I can personally attest to how well it works. And we offered a promotional 10% Cashback Bonus on in-store purchases using Apple Pay, which drove about adoption in our card base and also attracted some new cardmembers to Discover. 
At the same time, we continued to be disciplined in managing credit as our total net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, declined 5 basis points. Our card lost rate remains among the lowest in the industry. 
We also achieved record originations in our non-card loans. We increased brand awareness for student loans through radio advertising and the Freshman Experience, a unique partnership with NBC News. In December, we launched Fast set of systems, a free tool to help families navigate the government's [indiscernible] filings and educate prospective students about their funding options, which should continue to increase Discover's student loan awareness in 2016. 
In personal loans, we launched several new digital initiatives to help drive growth. 
In Payments, the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. In 2015, we established new partnerships including network-to-network agreements, new Diners Club licensees and at the same time, we grew volume with existing payment partnerships like AribaPay. Perhaps most importantly, the Discover Network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business as evidenced by the fact that we are accepted at more than 37 million locations worldwide, roughly 20% more than a year ago. 
As we look back on 2015, we feel good about our accomplishments. We generated a 21% return on equity for the full year and repurchased 6% of our stock. 
Now let's move to Slide 7. For 2016, our vision is unchanged. We aspire to be the leading U.S. bank and payments partner. Our key focus areas for the year will help us move forward towards accomplishing our vision. In 2016, we are targeting faster loan growth, which you will see in the guidance that Mark will go through later in the call. We expect this growth to be a balance between new accounts and our existing portfolio. 
Discover it continues to perform well in the marketplace, helped by the Double Cashback bonus offer from new cardmembers during the first year. While we anticipate the majority of our new account growth will come from our flagship Discover it Card, we expect to see additional growth from our Miles it Card and the recently launched Secured Card. 
To support the growth of the Miles it Card we introduced last year, we recently aired our first television advertising to increase awareness of the product and features. In addition, we announced the broad market launch of the Discover it Secured Card on Monday. This product will give customers who are new to credit access to the features and benefits of a Discover it product fully secured by a cash deposit. This is another opportunity for us to reach new customers and retain them as they develop a strong credit history. 
In the existing portfolio, we have a number of initiatives, some of which are already underway to support loan growth including a strategy to reengage and actives when they receive their EMV card, appropriate credit line increases for eligible customers and profitable balance transfers. Underlying all these initiatives is our commitment to a disciplined approach to credit management, which has served Discover well through previous credit cycles. 
In addition, we will continue to build-out our digital capabilities with enhanced customer features. By the end of the month, we will have completed the full rollout of our unique pay with cashback functionality online and in our app. This will offer customers the ability to pay their monthly card bill using their Cashback Bonus seamlessly. We continue to innovate in the features and benefits that drive customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty. 
Moving down the slide. In 2016, we will be very focused on operating expense leverage. Historically, we've had one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. While our 2015 ratio was elevated due to some onetime items, we were managing the business to trend back towards our long-term target. 
In 2016, we expect to invest in growth and to see increases in ongoing compliance costs while also finding ways to optimize the core expense base. We have a unique set of payment assets, which present many long-term opportunities for us. Near term, we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. 
While Payment Services struggled with some third-party volume losses, we expect volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year, and we continue to seek opportunities to bring more volume from third parties on to our network. We were looking broadly across this segments, domestically, internationally, in business to business and in consumer payments. We have the ability to scale significantly and are committed to driving value. 
In 2016, we will be particularly focused on closing up our AML look back and continuing to enhance our compliance-related functions. Investing in compliance and risk management will enable us to meet increasing regulatory requirements while also strengthening our operations and supporting our leadership position in customer service. 
In lastly, we will optimize our capital deployment so we can consistently deliver strong returns to our shareholders while driving quality organic growth. We have big goals for 2016 and are hard at work to achieve them. We are especially working to accelerate profitable loan growth. 
Now I'll turn the call to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and forward-looking guidance.

3695566,320953402,921868,"Discover Financial Services, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Discover Financial Services","Executives","Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on Slide 8 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total noninterest income was up $108 million. I would r",1612,"Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on Slide 8 of our presentation. 
Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total noninterest income was up $108 million. I would remind you that the prior year period include a onetime charge of $178 million related to the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve. Excluding this onetime item in the prior year, noninterest income declined $70 million. 
The rewards rate was 118 basis points, up 18 basis points from prior year on an adjusted basis, largely due to the double rewards program for new cardmembers as well as fourth quarter Apple Pay promotion. Protection products revenue continues to decline, down $15 million year-over-year given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenues decreased $30 million, primarily due to the loss of mortgage origination revenue as we closed our direct mortgage operation this year. 
Payment Services revenue was down $14 million primarily due to lower transaction processing revenue at PULSE. This was largely the result of the previously disclosed loss of volume from a large debit issuer. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total loan yield of 11.49% was up 9 basis points over the prior year. This higher yield was offset by higher funding costs and a larger liquidity portfolio. Combined, these drove net interest margin on receivables down 1 basis point from the prior year to 9.75%. However, on a sequential basis, NIM expanded by 13 basis points driven by higher card yield due to portfolio mix. 
Personal loans were the only asset class where the yield declined from the prior year. Shorter terms   year-over-year and a $5 million onetime adjustment to deferred loan origination cost drove the decline. As the origination cost adjustment was nonrecurring, we would expect that in the first quarter of 2016, personal loan yields will rebound to levels roughly in line with the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. Total operating expense was roughly flat in part because both periods included some onetime items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized $48 million in charges in other expenses associated with 2 items. First, the $27 million impairment of goodwill related to the mortgage origination business, which we subsequently exited; and second, a $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy classified as held for sale, which we've now sold. In the current period, we incurred $37 million in expense resulting from the anti-money laundering look back project. Adjusting for these items, expenses were $12 million or 1% higher year-over-year. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 11. Provision for loan losses was higher by $27 million due primarily to higher reserve build compared to the prior year. As David mentioned earlier, prevention growth on a full year basis was essentially in-line with average loan growth. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.18%, down 8 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus delinquency rate was relatively flat year-over-year at 1.72% and up 7 basis points from the prior quarter. 
The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans, decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. The 30 plus day delinquency rate increased by 11 basis points over the prior year to 1.9% as the organic book continues to enter repayment. 
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 8 basis points year-over-year to 2.3% due to the seasoning of newer vintages in line with expectations. And the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 10 basis points to 89 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results. 
Next I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.9%. The sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by a combination of seasonal loan growth and capital deployment. On that latter point, we repurchased $435 million of stock in the quarter. In total, during 2015, we returned over $2 billion in capital to shareholders with a 94%[ph] payout ratio. To complete the repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buyback over $800 million of shares in the first half of 2016. 
Moving to long-term guidance on Slide 13. The majority of these items have not changed since our last Investor Day, so I'll focus only on the 2 that have changed and are circled on the page. I would remind you that items of this page represent expected averages through the cycle and do not been serving reflect our expectations for 2016. Going forward, we'll be guiding to total loan growth as opposed to the component pieces. We expect long-term total loan growth of 4% to 6%. Consistent with this change, we've also updated the long-term guidance to reflect the total net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, which we expect to be 3% to 4%. 
Turning to Slide 14. We'd spend a minute on guidance that is specific to 2016. First, we expect total loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%, in line with our long-term target. Keep in mind that card represents roughly 80% of our portfolio. So achieving 4% to 6% of loan growth requires us to accelerate card growth from the recent trend. 
On that last point, I want to remind you of a nuance in how we report our monthly loan data. We don't process Payments for the Card business on Saturdays. So when a month ends on a Saturday, our 8-K reported receivables include Saturday sales, but no Payments from that day. This can create distortions in year-over-year comparisons. A good rule of thumb is to expect the positive bump of 50 to 60 basis points to the year-over-year growth when the current month ends on a Saturday, and to expect the drag of 50 to 60 basis points when the prior year month ends on a Saturday. Obviously, this is just the timing impact, but we're calling it out because both January and February ended on a Saturday last year. As a result, our relative year-over-year growth will be understated in our reporting for each of those months this year. 
Moving to our outlook. For net interest margin in 2016, we expect it to be what I would call relatively stable when compared to our full year 2015 NIM of 9.68%, perhaps with a bit of an upward bias. Further increases in rates would benefit us based on the modest sensitivity we've built into the balance sheet, but we may also see some offsets depending upon the level of card promotional activity and run off in higher rate in default price balances. 
With respect to rewards, we're planning to spend more on a full year basis in 2016. Specifically, we expect the full year rate around 115 basis points or roughly 7 basis points higher than 2015. A good portion of the increase is the first year double rewards program, which has delivered a lower-cost product out and brought on more engage customers, well worth the investment. 
Moving to non-interest noninterchange revenue. As we've said throughout 2015, we expect this line item to be lower this year. The primary drivers are the exit of the direct mortgage origination product, which generated roughly $74 million in revenue in 2015; continued run off in protection products revenue, which we estimate to be about $40 million lower in 2016; and a lower Payment Services revenue in part reflecting the sale of the Diners Club Italy franchise. Taking all of these into account, we expect non-interest, noninterchange revenue to decline approximately $125 million in 2016. 
Moving to the total net charge-off rate ex PCI notes, we expect it to be slightly higher than 2015. The credit environment continues to feel benign with our reserve build in the fourth quarter reflective of the seasoning of several years of card loan growth at levels above the portfolio charge-off rate, in line with our expectations. In addition, we assume a more modest outlook for improvement in the U.S. economy in 2016. 
Finally, we expect operating expense to be slightly above $3.5 billion next year. This reflects the roll off of the AML/BSA look back expenses over the course of 2016, incremental expenses for ongoing regulatory and compliance costs that are facing all participants in the industry, initiatives to accelerate loan growth as well as operating efficiency improvements. Based on this level of expense, we expect to drive positive operating leverage and decrease our efficiency ratio, which is already one of the lowest among large banks. 
To close things out, we have a business model that is generating strong returns on equity. While third-party payment volume has declined recently, we expect our Payment Services segment volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year. This should position us for growth in future years, which is why we are keeping our long-term Payments volume growth target of 10%. 
Near term, we are very focused on the remediation of our AML/BSA consent order and reducing expense in 2016. We'll be focused on accelerating total loan growth in a disciplined fashion, focusing on opportunities that are profitable for the long-term and not sacrificing credit for the sake of growth. 
Last but not least, we have a strong capital position that enables us to both invested in the business to drive growth and deliver prudently aggressive payouts to shareholders within the constraints of the CCAR process. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sabrina, to begin our Q&A session."

We knew it was onetime nonrecurring and cutting muscle that drives the business forewarned didn't make a lot of sense, right, in that regard.

That notwithstanding, I think at the end of the day there are clearly levers we can pull when it makes sense to pull them. With respect to what is a slight increase in charge-offs, I kind of reiterate what I said that Don maybe expanded on it a little bit, it's going to stay clearly in the low 2% range, Sanjay. We do not see any signs of a turn in the credit environment. We are operating with many years of growth seasoning in the portfolio right now and as we've said, new account season at loss rates higher than legacy portfolio, so there's a bit of an impact there. But the credit environment itself continues to feel very benign and we're not trying to signal some giant inflection points in charge-offs."

Charge-offs, you noticed that we have a long-term target and it's very disconnected with where we are and what mark said is slight increase. So clearly, we expect to be significantly below that long-term range during this coming year."

Looking forward, we do have significant urgency in accelerating growth that's why we've committed to that 4% to 6% total growth range for next year, and that should come both from the new accounts side as well as the existing portfolio. And there's a whole range of activities that we have focused on getting more new accounts, activating the more leveraging balance transfer, Miles card, gaining wallet share on the portfolio side as we continue to roll out features like Freeze It.

And what that means is those new accounts we've put on in the last 2 quarters are going to continue to build their balances into next year. And so that's one of the things we're continuing to focus on is efforts that, ultimately, will result in balance growth and we're really pleased with the new accounts, but it's not as instant as balance transfer. Now balance transfer, I think, is an opportunity. We've pulled back a bit on balance transfer because we found some areas that we thought were not profitable, didn't meet our hurdles. But we are now pursuing some opportunities that we think will be more productive and more profitable. So I think we can probably do a little more balance transfer a small this year than we did last year."

So they're both kind of have a common purpose on driving utilization spend and also in loan growth on the card. The one thing I would follow on to David's earlier remarks, which is loan growth from new accounts, from prime new accounts, emerges down the road a little bit, right? So you originate the account, the account comes on the books, you begin to see the spend behavior come on to the card. But unless you're balance transferring a big balance over, it takes time for that utilization to build those balances up. So we continue to feel good about the ultimate impact of the new accounts we're putting on, we believe we'll begin to see through 2016 that manifests itself in loan growth, but there's a line there."

Because when you say the reserving in the kind of 2.6% to 2.7% level, I mean, it was kind of consistently in the last 4 quarters, are you referring to the reserves for loans as opposed to the provisions for loans? Because provisions for loans really have bounced around a lot. And if there were 2.7% this quarter, but if we look at a world where you're guiding to charge-offs in the low 2s and we're now at 2.7% on a reserve-to-loan ratio, would that imply that would absent really strong loan growth that the provision to loan should be lower in the coming quarters than they were in those quarter?"

I would tell you based on the seasoning of the growth we've put on the books over the course of the last couple of years, as well as the challenge that David has put in front of the team to accelerate loan growth as we go into this year as well, I would not expect the provisions to decrease. By the same token, I would very clearly state so that I'm not misunderstood, don't expect some giant increase in that card reserve rates right now based on what we currently see in our models, that obviously changes. But if you think about it, Mark, the next 6 months are pretty well known, right? So we're reserving for 12 months out. The next 6 months, we can pretty well see in the roll buckets. It's really that period of 6 to 12 months out where you've got a little bit of uncertainty, where your models get impacted to a degree by the macro variables and your assessment of the health and the strength of the economy and what that's going to do to our borrower. So there's always a little bit of uncertainty, it is a forecastle so by definition it's strong. If you try to be as right as you can with something along the bottom of the credit cycle we have been for a while, so there will be a little bit of volatility here. But I always just try to remind everybody, this is a $1.8 billion balance sheet item. So a little bit of volatility drives some moves in EPS."

And I would say, we're certainly seeing in the marketplace right now people that are in lesser credits are seeing significant growth and the prime market is really not growing hardly at all. And so we're not willing to sacrifice our credit to go into subprime. But what that this product allows us to do is to get people that might currently reconsider sub-prime to get our products from us to be protected from losses because we have the security deposit and to work with those customers, to graduate them into prime loans when they're ready. So it is our way of new to credit or blemish credit in a way that protects our losses. And so I guess the final thing I'd say, we did a lot of market research looking at competitive products, and we don't see anything in the marketplace that's like this. Most other cards are stripped-down cards, they don't have rewards, they don't have benefits, they service the cards offshore. This is a real Discover it Card with everything that comes with it.

And so they may need to start out with a secured card just because they just didn't get credit, they didn't get credit history, this helps address that need. A lot of what's happening though is the big bounce back, in my opinion, in the sub-prime market because I think that decline far more a few years ago than the prime did even and there are a very few competitors in it. And now, the very few people who are in sub-prime still, including the private labels that have high yields and lower credits, are seeing a big bounce back. But it's a smaller segment than the prime segment. I think the more important thing for us is to gain share in prime. But what we want to do is identify the people that can become prime over time and get them started before they're all the way there to the prime."

We are always looking to further efficiencies to get operating synergies and driving greater returns on that. As I said earlier, we do have some levers, we can put if we get there.

The figures I've seen from the leading companies in the marketplace space is sub-700 average.

In terms of whether there will be a shake out, I'm sure there will be a shakeout, I'm sure people will survive, but I don't think that they'll be hundreds of competitors and it is an unproven model to the cycle. And I believe that our model of originated and holding versus just an originate and sale that relies solely on growth and you stop originating, you don't have revenue. I believe that our relationship, owning the credits, being able to finance it on our balance sheet and not having to rely on securitization markets that we have seen can completely dry up in the crisis, I think, is a more sustainable model.

I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016. Then I'll hand it over to Mark to review the fourth quarter in more detail and share some forward-looking guidance. 
Starting on Slide 3 of our earnings presentation, we reported fourth quarter net income of $500 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, up 31% due to some onetime charges in the prior year. We were able to drive our return on equity, up 18% for the quarter, despite higher loan loss provisions and higher nonrecurring expenses driven by the anti-money laundering look back. 
Turning to Slide 4. Discover achieved total loan growth of 3.5% over the prior year. Card receivables grew 3% this quarter, lower than we would like. However, this was partly due to lower promotional balance growth compared to the prior period. 
Total sales for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year or roughly 5% excluding gas sales. Lower gas prices have continued to impact our sales and card loan growth more than we had anticipated. However, we believe that also somewhat helped credit results in 2015. 
Moving to our next largest asset class, private student loans grew 3%. However, excluding our acquired portfolios, we achieved 16% growth year-over-year. Personal loans increased to $5.5 billion, up 10% from the prior year. 
On the right-hand side of Slide 4, we lay out Payments volume growth. Proprietary volume continued to increase in support of the card issuing business. However, our third-party Payments segment had lower volume compared to the prior year. A large part of the volume in the segment comes from PULSE, where we saw continued declines in the challenging post-Durbin environment. 
Performance was good in the other network businesses, although they represent a much smaller portion of the total Payments volume. Network Partners volume increased significantly driven by AribaPay volumes, while Diners volume decreased slightly as reported, but was up nicely on a constant dollar basis. 
Now, I'm going to touch on our full year financial results shown on Slide 5. In our 2015 -- in 2015, our earnings crossed the $5 per share mark for the first time. Revenue increased 3% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. 
Moving down this slide, provisioning grew roughly in line with the average loan growth. Expense growth was primarily driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, particularly related to our AML consent order remediation. Due to the strength of our capital generation and buyback program, EPS increased 5% for the full year versus 2014. 
Moving to Slide 6, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 to move the business forward. We continued to grow our balance sheet with total loans up 3.5% from the prior year. We introduced new features and benefits throughout the year to attract and retain customers. 
In Card, we introduce the innovative Freeze It capability, which allows customers to suspend their credit card with a few clicks from their app in the event it's misplaced. I can personally attest to how well it works. And we offered a promotional 10% Cashback Bonus on in-store purchases using Apple Pay, which drove adoption in our card base and also attracted some new cardmembers to Discover. 
At the same time, we continued to be disciplined in managing credit as our total net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, declined 5 basis points. Our card loss rate remains among the lowest in the industry. 
We also achieved record originations in our non-card loans. We increased brand awareness for student loans through radio advertising and The Freshman Experience, a unique partnership with NBC News. 
In December, we launched FAFSA Assistance -- Assistant, a free tool to help families navigate government student aid filings and educate prospective students about their funding options, which should continue to increase Discover student loan awareness in 2016. 
In personal loans, we launched several new digital initiatives to help drive growth. In Payments, the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. In 2015, we established new partnerships, including network-to-network agreements, new Diners Club licensees, and at the same time, we grew volume with existing payment partnerships like AribaPay. 
Perhaps most importantly, the Discover Network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business as evidenced by the fact that we are accepted at more than 37 million locations worldwide, roughly 20% more than a year ago. 
As we look back on 2015, we feel good about our accomplishments. We generated a 21% return on equity for the full year and repurchased 6% of our stock. 
Now, let's move to Slide 7. For 2016, our vision is unchanged. We aspire to be the leading U.S. direct bank and payments partner. Our key focus areas for the year will help us move forward towards accomplishing our vision. In 2016, we are targeting faster loan growth, which you will see in the guidance that Mark goes through later in the call. We expect this growth to be balanced between new accounts and our existing portfolio. 
Discover it continues to perform well in the marketplace, helped by the Double Cashback Bonus offer from new cardmembers during the first year. While we anticipate the majority of our new account growth will come from our flagship Discover it Card, we expect to see additional growth from our Miles It Card and the recently launched Secured Card. 
To support the growth of the Miles It Card we introduced last year, we've recently aired our first television advertisement to increase awareness of the product and features. In addition, we announced the broad market launch of the Discover it Secured Card on Monday. This product will give customers who are new to credit access to the features and benefits of a Discover it product fully secured by a cash deposit. This is another opportunity for us to reach new customers and retain them as they develop a strong credit history. 
In the existing portfolio, we have a number of initiatives, some of which are already underway to support loan growth, including a strategy to reengage inactives when they receive their EMV card, appropriate credit line increases for eligible customers and profitable balance transfers. 
Underlying all these initiatives is our commitment to a disciplined approach to credit management, which has served Discover well through previous credit cycles. 
In addition, we will continue to build out our digital capabilities with enhanced customer features. By the end of the month, we will have completed the full rollout of our unique pay with cashback functionality online and in our app. This will offer customers the ability to pay their monthly card bill using their Cashback Bonus seamlessly. We continue to innovate in the features and benefits that drive customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty. 
Moving down the slide, in 2016, we will be very focused on operating expense leverage. Historically, we've had one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. While our 2015 ratio was elevated due to some onetime items, we are managing the business to trend back towards our long-term target. 
In 2016, we expect to invest in growth and to see increases in ongoing compliance costs, while also finding ways to optimize the core expense base. We have a unique set of payment assets, which present many long-term opportunities for us. Near term, we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. 
While Payment Services struggled with some third-party volume losses, we expect volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year, and we continue to seek opportunities to bring more volume from third parties onto our network. We are looking broadly across this segment, domestically, internationally, in business-to-business and in consumer payments. We have the ability to scale significantly and are committed to driving value. 
In 2016, we will be particularly focused on closing up our AML look back and continuing to enhance our compliance-related functions. Investing in compliance and risk management will enable us to meet increasing regulatory requirements, while also strengthening our operations and supporting our leadership position in customer service. 
And lastly, we will optimize our capital deployment so we can consistently deliver strong returns to our shareholders while driving quality organic growth. We have big goals for 2016 and are hard at work to achieve them. We are especially working to accelerate profitable loan growth. 
Now, I'll turn the call to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and forward-looking guidance. Mark?"

I'll start with the revenue detail on Slide 8 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total noninterest income was up $108 million. I would r",1616,"Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on Slide 8 of our presentation. 
Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total noninterest income was up $108 million. I would remind you that the prior year period included a onetime charge of $178 million related to the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve. Excluding this onetime item in the prior year, noninterest income declined $70 million. 
The rewards rate was 118 basis points, up 8 basis points from the prior year on an adjusted basis, largely due to the double rewards program for new cardmembers as well as our fourth quarter Apple Pay promotion. 
Protection products revenue continues to decline, down $15 million year-over-year given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenues decreased $30 million, primarily due to the loss of mortgage origination revenue as we closed our direct mortgage operation this year. 
Payment Services revenue was down $14 million, primarily due to lower transaction processing revenue at PULSE. This was largely the result of the previously disclosed loss of volume from a large debit issuer. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total loan yield of 11.49% was up 9 basis points over the prior year. This higher yield was offset by higher funding costs and a larger liquidity portfolio. Combined, these drove net interest margin on receivables down 1 basis point from the prior year to 9.75%. However, on a sequential basis, NIM expanded by 13 basis points driven by higher card yield due to portfolio mix. 
Personal loans were the only asset class where the yield declined from the prior year. Shorter terms   year-over-year and a $5 million onetime adjustment to deferred loan origination cost drove the decline. As the origination cost adjustment was nonrecurring, we would expect that in the first quarter of 2016, personal loan yields will rebound to levels roughly in line with the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. Total operating expense was roughly flat in part because both periods included some onetime items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized $48 million in charges in other expenses associated with 2 items: first, the $27 million impairment of goodwill related to the mortgage origination business, which we subsequently exited; and second, a $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy being classified as held for sale, which we've now sold. 
In the current period, we incurred $37 million in expense resulting from the anti-money laundering look back project. Adjusting for these items, expenses were $12 million or 1% higher year-over-year. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 11. Provision for loan losses was higher by $27 million due primarily to a higher reserve build compared to the prior year. As David mentioned earlier, provision growth on a full year basis was essentially in-line with average loan growth. 
The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.18%, down 8 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was relatively flat year-over-year at 1.72% and up 7 basis points from the prior quarter. 
The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans, decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate increased by 11 basis points over the prior year to 1.9% as the organic book continues to enter repayment. 
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 8 basis points year-over-year to 2.3% due to the seasoning of newer vintages in line with expectations, and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 10 basis points to 89 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results. 
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 13.9%. This sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by a combination of seasonal loan growth and capital deployment. 
On that latter point, we repurchased $435 million of stock in the quarter. In total, during 2015, we returned over $2 billion in capital to shareholders with a 94% payout ratio. To complete the repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buyback over $800 million of shares in the first half of 2016. 
Moving to long-term guidance on Slide 13. The majority of these items have not changed since our last Investor Day, so I'll focus only on the 2 that have changed and are circled on the page. I would remind you that the items on this page represent expected averages through the cycle and do not necessarily reflect our expectations for 2016. 
Going forward, we'll be guiding to total loan growth as opposed to the component pieces. We expect long-term total loan growth of 4% to 6%. Consistent with this change, we've also updated the long-term guidance to reflect the total net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, which we expect to be 3% to 4%. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let's spend a minute on guidance that is specific to 2016. First, we expect total loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% in line with our long-term target. Keep in mind that card represents roughly 80% of our portfolio, so achieving 4% to 6% of loan growth requires us to accelerate card growth from the recent trend. 
On that last point, I want to remind you of a nuance in how we report our monthly loan data. We don't process Payments for the Card business on Saturdays. So when a month ends on a Saturday, our 8-K reported receivables include Saturday sales, but no Payments from that day. This can create distortions in year-over-year comparisons. 
A good rule of thumb is to expect a positive bump of 50 to 60 basis points to the year-over-year growth when the current month ends on a Saturday, and to expect a drag of 50 to 60 basis points when the prior year month ends on a Saturday. 
Obviously, this is just a timing impact, but we're calling it out because both January and February ended on a Saturday last year. As a result, our relative year-over-year growth will be understated in our reporting for each of those months this year. 
Moving to our outlook for net interest margin in 2016. We expect it to be what I would call relatively stable when compared to our full year 2015 NIM of 9.68%, perhaps with a bit of an upward bias. Further increases in rates would benefit us based on the modest asset sensitivity we've built into the balance sheet, but we may also see some offsets depending upon the level of card promotional activity and run off in higher rate in default price balances. 
With respect to rewards, we're planning to spend more on a full year basis in 2016. Specifically, we expect the full year rate around 115 basis points or roughly 7 basis points higher than 2015. A good portion of the increase is the first year double rewards program, which has delivered a lower-cost per account and brought on more engaged customers, well worth the investment. 
Moving to non-interest non-interchange revenue. As we've said throughout 2015, we expect this line item to be lower this year. The primary drivers are the exit of the direct mortgage origination product, which generated roughly $74 million in revenue in 2015; continued run off in protection products revenue, which we estimate to be about $40 million lower in 2016; and a lower Payment Services revenue in part reflecting the sale of the Diners Club Italy franchise. Taking all of these into account, we expect non-interest, non-interchange revenue to decline approximately $125 million in 2016. 
Moving to the total net charge-off rate x PCI loans, we expect it to be slightly higher than 2015. The credit environment continues to feel benign with our reserve build in the fourth quarter reflective of the seasoning of several years of card loan growth at levels above the portfolio charge-off rate in line with our expectations. In addition, we assume a more modest outlook for improvement in the U.S. economy in 2016. 
Finally, we expect operating expense to be slightly above $3.5 billion next year. This reflects the roll off of the AML/BSA look back expenses over the course of 2016, incremental expenses for ongoing regulatory and compliance costs that are facing all participants in the industry, initiatives to accelerate loan growth as well as operating efficiency improvements. 
Based on this level of expense, we expect to drive positive operating leverage and decrease our efficiency ratio, which is already one of the lowest among large banks. 
To close things out, we have a business model that is generating strong returns on equity. While third-party payment volume has declined recently, we expect our Payment Services segment volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year. This should position us for growth in future years, which is why we are keeping our long-term Payments volume growth target at 10%. 
Near term, we are very focused on the remediation of our AML/BSA consent order and reducing expenses in 2016. We'll be focused on accelerating total loan growth in a disciplined fashion, focusing on opportunities that are profitable for the long-term and not sacrificing credit for the sake of growth. 
Last but not least, we have a strong capital position that enables us to both invest in the business to drive growth and deliver prudently aggressive payouts to shareholders within the constraints of the CCAR process. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sabrina, to begin the Q&A session."

The provision really on a full year basis is consistent with loan growth on a full year basis, which is kind of, I think, what we've been saying people should be expecting.

You make decisions from time to time on whether or not you want to pull to those levers, right? We knew that the look back project for the AML/BSA was going to be big dollars. We knew it was onetime nonrecurring and cutting muscle that drives the business forward, didn't make a lot of sense, right, in that regard. That being said, we covered an awful lot of ongoing expense increases in regulatory and compliance world with operating efficiency gains this year. I think you should look to see us do the same next year. Candidly, I think we kind of landed right on top, more or less, of our OpEx guidance for the full year for this past year. It came in, I think, $15 million over something like that, but on a $3.6 billion line item, kind of feel like we did a decent job. That notwithstanding, I think at the end of the day, there clearly are levers we can pull when it makes sense to pull them. With respect to what is a slight increase in charge-offs, I kind of reiterate what I said to Don, maybe expand on it a little bit. It's going to stay clearly in the low 2% range, Sanjay. We do not see any signs of a turn in the credit environment. We are operating with many years of growth seasoning in the portfolio right now. And as we've said, new account season at loss rates higher than legacy portfolio, so there's a bit of an impact there. But the credit environment itself continues to feel very benign and we're not trying to signal some giant inflection point in charge-offs."

Looking forward, we do have significant urgency in accelerating growth. That's why we've committed to that 4% to 6% total growth range for next year, and that should come both from the new accounts side as well as the existing portfolio. And there's a whole range of activities that we have: focus on getting more new accounts, activating the more leveraging balance transfer, Miles card, gaining wallet share on the portfolio side as we continue to roll out features like Freeze It.

And so that's one of the things we're continuing to focus on is efforts that, ultimately, will result in balance growth. And we're really pleased with the new accounts, but it's not as instant as a balance transfer. Now balance transfer, I think, is still an opportunity. We have -- we pull back a bit on balance transfer because we found some areas that we thought were not profitable, didn't meet our hurdles. But we are now pursuing some opportunities that we think will be more productive and more profitable, so I think we can probably do a little more balance transfer as well this year than we did last year."

You can also do it by providing a rewards product that, on an everyday basis, engages that customer in ways that incents them to utilize the card as well. So they're both -- kind of have a common purpose of driving utilization spend and also a loan growth on the card. The one thing I would follow on to David's earlier remarks with is loan growth from new accounts, from prime new accounts, emerges down the road a little bit, right? So you originate the account, the account comes on the books, you begin to see the spend behavior come on to the card. But unless you're balance transferring a big balance over, right, it takes time for that utilization to build those balances up. So we continue to feel good about the ultimate impact of the new accounts we're putting on.

The number we've been calling out for BSA/AML compliance, we specifically identified as a project, right? This is a look back on transactions over a period of time historically, and it's got a finite end date and a finite process it runs. So that definitely bleeds off as we go into 2016, and the cost of that is included in the expense guidance that we gave earlier. So we're considering the lingering effects of that as we look at the remainder of this year. What I would say is there are obviously ongoing costs associated with the BSA/AML program enhancements. Those, we have largely been covering with either run rate operating efficiencies that we have found to date, and we'll look to find ways to offset those expenses as we move forward. But they are fractions, very small fractions of the total number we're talking about around the project."

I would tell you based on the seasoning of the growth we've put on the books over the course of the last couple of years as well as the challenge that David has put in front of the team to accelerate loan growth as we go into this year as well, I would not expect the provisions to decrease. By the same token, I would very clearly state so that I'm not misunderstood, don't expect some giant increase in that card reserve rates right now based on what we currently see in our models. That obviously changes. But if you think about it, Mark, the next 6 months are pretty well known, right? So we're reserving for 12 months out. The next 6 months, we can pretty well see in the roll buckets. It's really that period of 6 to 12 months out where you've got a little bit of uncertainty, where your models get impacted to a degree by the macro variables and your assessment of the health and the strength of the economy and what that's going to do to our borrower. So there's always a little bit of uncertainty in this. It is a forecast. So by definition, it's wrong. You try and be as right as you can. We're something along the bottom of the credit cycle. We have been for a while, so there will be a little bit of volatility here. But what I always just try and remind everybody is this is a $1.8 billion balance sheet item, so a little bit of volatility drives some moves in EPS."

And I would say we're certainly seeing in the marketplace right now people that are in the lesser credits are seeing significant growth, and the prime market is really not growing hardly at all. And so we're not willing to sacrifice our credit to go into subprime, but what that this product allows us to do is to get people that might currently be considered subprime to get our product for us to be protected from losses because we have the security deposit, and to work with those customers, to graduate them into prime loans when they're ready. And so it is our way of new to credit or blemish credit in a way that protects our losses. And so I guess the final thing I'd say is we did a lot of market research, looking at competitive products. And we don't see anything in the marketplace that is like this. Most other cards are stripped-down cards. They don't have rewards. They don't have benefits. They service the cards offshore. This is a real Discover it Card with everything that comes with it, and the only thing unique is it's fully secured.

And so they may need to start out with a secured card just because they just didn't get any credit, didn't get a credit history. So this helps address that need. A lot of what's happening, though, is the big bounce back, in my opinion, in the subprime market. Because I think that decline far more a few years ago than the prime did even, and there were a very few competitors in it. And now the very few people who are in subprime still, including the private labels that tend to have high yields and lower credits, are seeing a big bounce back. But it's a smaller segment than the prime segment. I think the more important thing for us is to gain share in prime, but what we want to do is identify the people that can become prime over time and get them started before they're all the way there to prime."

I would say, Bob, what's driving it really is seasoning of the portfolio, right? I mean, you think you've seen double-digit growth rates there over the course of a number of years. Personal loans don't season radically differently than credit card loans do. There's a little bit of a change in the shape of the curve, and it's not exactly the same. But they tend to season after origination. You don't get a lot of first payment defaults when you do it prudently, thankfully. So I would say it's just seasoning. Don't expect any major deterioration of any kind to that portfolio, and the seasoning we are seeing is in line with expectations."

And I think that part of the reason is that our -- the people that we're targeting tend to be very different than the credits that most of those are targeting. Our average FICO score is 750, 760. The figures I've seen from the leading companies in the marketplace space is sub-700 average, and that's -- when every 20 points of FICO means a doubling of credit losses, that is a very big difference in target markets. And so we think that we're still the leader in prime originations in the space. In terms of whether there will be a shake out, I'm sure there will be a shakeout. I'm sure some people will survive, but I don't think that they'll be hundreds of competitors. And it is an unproven model to the cycle, and I believe that our model of originating and holding versus just a originate and sale that relies solely on growth and that you stop originating, you don't have revenue, I believe that our relationship, owning the credits, being able to finance it on our balance sheet and not being -- not having to rely on securitization markets that we have seen can completely dry up in a crisis, I think is a more sustainable model.

I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016.

I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016. Then I'll hand it over to Mark to review the fourth quarter in more detail and share some forward-looking guidance. 
Starting on Slide 3 of our earnings presentation, we reported fourth quarter net income of $500 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, up 31% due to some onetime charges in the prior year. We were able to drive our return on equity, up 18% for the quarter, despite higher loan loss provisions and higher nonrecurring expenses driven by the anti-money laundering look back. 
Turning to Slide 4. Discover achieved total loan growth of 3.5% over the prior year. Card receivables grew 3% this quarter, lower than we would like. However, this was partly due to lower promotional balance growth compared to the prior period. 
Total sales for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year or roughly 5% excluding gas sales. Lower gas prices have continued to impact our sales and card loan growth more than we had anticipated. However, we believe that also somewhat helped credit results in 2015. 
Moving to our next largest asset class, private student loans grew 3%. However, excluding our acquired portfolios, we achieved 16% growth year-over-year. Personal loans increased to $5.5 billion, up 10% from the prior year. 
On the right-hand side of Slide 4, we lay out Payments volume growth. Proprietary volume continued to increase in support of the card issuing business. However, our third-party Payments segment had lower volume compared to the prior year. A large part of the volume in the segment comes from PULSE, where we saw continued declines in the challenging post-Durbin environment. 
Performance was good in the other network businesses, although they represent a much smaller portion of the total Payments volume. Network Partners volume increased significantly driven by AribaPay volumes, while Diners volume decreased slightly as reported, but was up nicely on a constant dollar basis. 
Now, I'm going to touch on our full year financial results shown on Slide 5. In our 2015 -- in 2015, our earnings crossed the $5 per share mark for the first time. Revenue increased 3% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. 
Moving down this slide, provisioning grew roughly in line with the average loan growth. Expense growth was primarily driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, particularly related to our AML consent order remediation. Due to the strength of our capital generation and buyback program, EPS increased 5% for the full year versus 2014. 
Moving to Slide 6, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 to move the business forward. We continued to grow our balance sheet with total loans up 3.5% from the prior year. We introduced new features and benefits throughout the year to attract and retain customers. 
In Card, we introduced the innovative Freeze It capability, which allows customers to suspend their credit card with a few clicks from their app in the event it's misplaced. I can personally attest to how well it works. And we offered a promotional 10% Cashback Bonus on in-store purchases using Apple Pay, which drove adoption in our card base and also attracted some new cardmembers to Discover. 
At the same time, we continued to be disciplined in managing credit as our total net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, declined 5 basis points. Our card loss rate remains among the lowest in the industry. 
We also achieved record originations in our non-card loans. We increased brand awareness for student loans through radio advertising and The Freshman Experience, a unique partnership with NBC News. 
In December, we launched FAFSA Assistance -- Assistant, a free tool to help families navigate government student aid filings and educate prospective students about their funding options, which should continue to increase Discover student loan awareness in 2016. 
In personal loans, we launched several new digital initiatives to help drive growth. In Payments, the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. In 2015, we established new partnerships, including network-to-network agreements, new Diners Club licensees, and at the same time, we grew volume with existing payment partnerships like AribaPay. 
Perhaps most importantly, the Discover Network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business as evidenced by the fact that we are accepted at more than 37 million locations worldwide, roughly 20% more than a year ago. 
As we look back on 2015, we feel good about our accomplishments. We generated a 21% return on equity for the full year and repurchased 6% of our stock. 
Now, let's move to Slide 7. For 2016, our vision is unchanged. We aspire to be the leading U.S. direct bank and payments partner. Our key focus areas for the year will help us move forward towards accomplishing our vision. In 2016, we are targeting faster loan growth, which you will see in the guidance that Mark goes through later in the call. We expect this growth to be balanced between new accounts and our existing portfolio. 
Discover it continues to perform well in the marketplace, helped by the Double Cashback Bonus offer from new cardmembers during the first year. While we anticipate the majority of our new account growth will come from our flagship Discover it Card, we expect to see additional growth from our Miles It Card and the recently launched Secured Card. 
To support the growth of the Miles It Card we introduced last year, we've recently aired our first television advertisement to increase awareness of the product and features. In addition, we announced the broad market launch of the Discover it Secured Card on Monday. This product will give customers who are new to credit access to the features and benefits of a Discover it product fully secured by a cash deposit. This is another opportunity for us to reach new customers and retain them as they develop a strong credit history. 
In the existing portfolio, we have a number of initiatives, some of which are already underway to support loan growth, including a strategy to reengage inactives when they receive their EMV card, appropriate credit line increases for eligible customers and profitable balance transfers. 
Underlying all these initiatives is our commitment to a disciplined approach to credit management, which has served Discover well through previous credit cycles. 
In addition, we will continue to build out our digital capabilities with enhanced customer features. By the end of the month, we will have completed the full rollout of our unique pay with cashback functionality online and in our app. This will offer customers the ability to pay their monthly card bill using their Cashback Bonus seamlessly. We continue to innovate in the features and benefits that drive customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty. 
Moving down the slide, in 2016, we will be very focused on operating expense leverage. Historically, we've had one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. While our 2015 ratio was elevated due to some onetime items, we are managing the business to trend back towards our long-term target. 
In 2016, we expect to invest in growth and to see increases in ongoing compliance costs, while also finding ways to optimize the core expense base. We have a unique set of payment assets, which present many long-term opportunities for us. Near term, we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. 
While Payment Services has struggled with some third-party volume losses, we expect volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year, and we continue to seek opportunities to bring more volume from third parties onto our network. We are looking broadly across this segment, domestically, internationally, in business-to-business and in consumer payments. We have the ability to scale significantly and are committed to driving value. 
In 2016, we will be particularly focused on closing out our AML look back and continuing to enhance our compliance-related functions. Investing in compliance and risk management will enable us to meet increasing regulatory requirements, while also strengthening our operations and supporting our leadership position in customer service. 
And lastly, we will optimize our capital deployment so we can consistently deliver strong returns to our shareholders while driving quality organic growth. We have big goals for 2016 and are hard at work to achieve them. We are especially working to accelerate profitable loan growth. 
Now, I'll turn the call to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and forward-looking guidance. Mark?"
3695566,320953402,921995,"Discover Financial Services, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Discover Financial Services","Executives","Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on Slide 8 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total noninterest income was up $108 million. I would r",1617,"Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on Slide 8 of our presentation. 
Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total noninterest income was up $108 million. I would remind you that the prior year period included a onetime charge of $178 million related to the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve. Excluding this onetime item in the prior year, noninterest income declined $70 million. 
The rewards rate was 118 basis points, up 8 basis points from the prior year on an adjusted basis, largely due to the double rewards program for new cardmembers as well as our fourth quarter Apple Pay promotion. 
Protection products revenue continues to decline, down $15 million year-over-year given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenues decreased $30 million, primarily due to the loss of mortgage origination revenue as we closed our direct mortgage operation this year. 
Payment Services revenue was down $14 million, primarily due to lower transaction processing revenue at PULSE. This was largely the result of the previously disclosed loss of volume from a large debit issuer. 
Turning to Slide 9. Total loan yield of 11.49% was up 9 basis points over the prior year. This higher yield was offset by higher funding costs and a larger liquidity portfolio. Combined, these drove net interest margin on receivables down 1 basis point from the prior year to 9.75%. However, on a sequential basis, NIM expanded by 13 basis points driven by higher card yield due to portfolio mix. 
Personal loans were the only asset class where the yield declined from the prior year. Shorter terms   year-over-year and a $5 million onetime adjustment to deferred loan origination cost drove the decline. As the origination cost adjustment was nonrecurring, we would expect that in the first quarter of 2016, personal loan yields will rebound to levels roughly in line with the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 10. Total operating expense was roughly flat in part because both periods included some onetime items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized $48 million in charges in other expenses associated with 2 items: first, the $27 million impairment of goodwill related to the mortgage origination business, which we subsequently exited; and second, a $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy being classified as held for sale, which we've now sold. 
In the current period, we incurred $37 million in expense resulting from the anti-money laundering look back project. Adjusting for these items, expenses were $12 million or 1% higher year-over-year. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 11. Provision for loan losses was higher by $27 million due primarily to a higher reserve build compared to the prior year. As David mentioned earlier, provision growth on a full year basis was essentially in-line with average loan growth. 
The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.18%, down 8 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was relatively flat year-over-year at 1.72% and up 7 basis points from the prior quarter. 
The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase credit impaired loans, decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate increased by 11 basis points over the prior year to 1.9% as the organic book continues to enter repayment. 
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 8 basis points year-over-year to 2.3% due to the seasoning of newer vintages in line with expectations, and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 10 basis points to 89 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results. 
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 13.9%. This sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by a combination of seasonal loan growth and capital deployment. 
On that latter point, we repurchased $435 million of stock in the quarter. In total, during 2015, we returned over $2 billion in capital to shareholders with a 94% payout ratio. To complete the repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buy back over $800 million of shares in the first half of 2016. 
Moving to long-term guidance on Slide 13. The majority of these items have not changed since our last Investor Day, so I'll focus only on the 2 that have changed and are circled on the page. I would remind you that the items on this page represent expected averages through the cycle and do not necessarily reflect our expectations for 2016. 
Going forward, we'll be guiding to total loan growth as opposed to the component pieces. We expect long-term total loan growth of 4% to 6%. Consistent with this change, we've also updated the long-term guidance to reflect the total net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, which we expect to be 3% to 4%. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let's spend a minute on guidance that is specific to 2016. First, we expect total loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% in line with our long-term target. Keep in mind that Card represents roughly 80% of our portfolio, so achieving 4% to 6% total loan growth requires us to accelerate Card growth from the recent trend. 
On that last point, I want to remind you of a nuance in how we report our monthly loan data. We don't process Payments for the Card business on Saturdays. So when a month ends on a Saturday, our 8-K reported receivables include Saturday sales, but no Payments from that day. This can create distortions in year-over-year comparisons. 
A good rule of thumb is to expect a positive bump of 50 to 60 basis points to the year-over-year growth when the current month ends on a Saturday, and to expect a drag of 50 to 60 basis points when the prior year month ends on a Saturday. 
Obviously, this is just a timing impact, but we're calling it out because both January and February ended on a Saturday last year. As a result, our relative year-over-year growth will be understated in our reporting for each of those months this year. 
Moving to our outlook for net interest margin in 2016. We expect it to be what I would call relatively stable when compared to our full year 2015 NIM of 9.68%, perhaps with a bit of an upward bias. Further increases in rates would benefit us based on the modest asset sensitivity we've built into the balance sheet, but we may also see some offsets depending upon the level of Card promotional activity and run off in higher rate in default price balances. 
With respect to rewards, we're planning to spend more on a full year basis in 2016. Specifically, we expect the full year rate around 115 basis points or roughly 7 basis points higher than 2015. A good portion of the increase is the first year double rewards program, which has delivered a lower-cost per account and brought on more engaged customers, well worth the investment. 
Moving to non-interest, non-interchange revenue. As we've said throughout 2015, we expect this line item to be lower this year. The primary drivers are the exit of the direct mortgage origination product, which generated roughly $74 million in revenue in 2015; continued run off in protection products revenue, which we estimate to be about $40 million lower in 2016; and a lower Payment Services revenue in part reflecting the sale of the Diners Club Italy franchise. Taking all of this into account, we expect non-interest, non-interchange revenue to decline approximately $125 million in 2016. 
Moving to the total net charge-off rate x PCI loans, we expect it to be slightly higher than 2015. The credit environment continues to feel benign with our reserve build in the fourth quarter reflective of the seasoning of several years of card loan growth at levels above the portfolio charge-off rate in line with our expectations. In addition, we assume a more modest outlook for improvement in the U.S. economy in 2016. 
Finally, we expect operating expense to be slightly above $3.5 billion next year. This reflects the roll off of the AML/BSA look back expenses over the course of 2016, incremental expenses for ongoing regulatory and compliance costs that are facing all participants in the industry, initiatives to accelerate loan growth as well as operating efficiency improvements. 
Based on this level of expense, we expect to drive positive operating leverage and decrease our efficiency ratio, which is already one of the lowest among large banks. 
To close things out, we have a business model that is generating strong returns on equity. While third-party payment volume has declined recently, we expect our Payment Services segment volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year. This should position us for growth in future years, which is why we are keeping our long-term Payments volume growth target at 10%. 
Near term, we are very focused on the remediation of our AML/BSA consent order and reducing expenses in 2016. We'll be focused on accelerating total loan growth in a disciplined fashion, focusing on opportunities that are profitable for the long-term and not sacrificing credit for the sake of growth. 
Last but not least, we have a strong capital position that enables us to both invest in the business to drive growth and deliver prudently aggressive payouts to shareholders within the constraints of the CCAR process. 
That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sabrina, to begin the Q&A session."

That being said, we covered an awful lot of ongoing expense increases in regulatory and compliance world with operating efficiency gains this year. I think you should look to see us do the same next year. Candidly, I think we kind of landed right on top, more or less, of our OpEx guidance for the full year for this past year. It came in, I think, $15 million over something like that, but on a $3.6 billion line item, kind of feel like we did a decent job. That notwithstanding, I think at the end of the day, there clearly are levers we can pull when it makes sense to pull them. With respect to what is a slight increase in charge-offs, I kind of reiterate what I said to Don, maybe expand on it a little bit. It's going to stay clearly in the low 2% range, Sanjay. We do not see any signs of a turn in the credit environment. We are operating with many years of growth seasoning in the portfolio right now.

I would tell you based on the seasoning of the growth we've put on the books over the course of the last couple of years as well as the challenge that David has put in front of the team to accelerate loan growth as we go into this year as well, I would not expect the provisions to decrease. By the same token, I would very clearly state so that I'm not misunderstood, don't expect some giant increase in that card reserve rates right now based on what we currently see in our models. That obviously changes. But if you think about it, Mark, the next 6 months are pretty well known, right? So we're reserving for 12 months out. The next 6 months, we can pretty well see in the roll buckets. It's really that period of 6 to 12 months out where you've got a little bit of uncertainty, where your models get impacted to a degree by the macro variables and your assessment of the health and the strength of the economy and what that's going to do to our borrower. So there's always a little bit of uncertainty in this. It is a forecast. So by definition, it's wrong. You try and be as right as you can. We're thumping along the bottom of the credit cycle. We have been for a while, so there will be a little bit of volatility here.

And I would say we're certainly seeing in the marketplace right now, people that are in the lesser credits are seeing significant growth, and the prime market is really not growing hardly at all. And so we're not willing to sacrifice our credit to go into subprime, but what this product allows us to do is to get people that might currently be considered subprime to get our product and for us to be protected from losses because we have the security deposit, and to work with those customers, to graduate them into prime loans when they're ready. And so it is our way of new to credit or blemished credit in a way that protects our losses. And so I guess the final thing I'd say is we did a lot of market research, looking at competitive products. And we don't see anything in the marketplace that is like this. Most other cards are stripped-down cards. They don't have rewards. They don't have benefits. They service the cards offshore. This is a real Discover it Card with everything that comes with it, and the only thing unique is it's fully secured.

And so they may need to start out with a secured card just because they just didn't get any credit, didn't get a credit history. So this helps address that need. A lot of what's happening, though, is the big bounce back, in my opinion, in the subprime market. Because I think that declined far more a few years ago than the prime did even, and there were very few competitors in it. And now the very few people who are in subprime still, including the private labels that tend to have high yields and lower credits, are seeing a big bounce back. But it's a smaller segment than the prime segment. I think the more important thing for us is to gain share in prime, but what we want to do is identify the people that can become prime over time and get them started before they're all the way there to prime."

And so I feel like we are -- we had some onetimes last year. I think they were relatively small to the total $3.5 billion spend compared to some other companies. But we prefer to have even fewer, and I think we've positioned ourselves, knock on wood, to have fewer going forward, especially as we get through this look back. So I gave you 2 answers for the price of one question."

But they tend to season after origination. You don't get a lot of first payment defaults when you do it prudently, thankfully. So I would say it's just seasoning.

And I think that part of the reason is that our -- the people that we're targeting tend to be very different than the credits that most of those are targeting. Our average FICO score is 750, 760. The figures I've seen from the leading companies in the marketplace space is sub-700 average, and that's -- when every 20 points of FICO means a doubling of credit losses, that is a very big difference in target market. And so we think that we're still the leader in prime originations in the space. In terms of whether there will be a shakeout, I'm sure there will be a shakeout. I'm sure some people will survive, but I don't think that they'll be hundreds of competitors. And it is an unproven model through the cycle, and I believe that our model of originating and holding versus just a originate and sale that relies solely on growth and that you stop originating, you don't have revenue, I believe that our relationship, owning the credits, being able to finance it on our balance sheet and not being -- not having to rely on securitization markets that we have seen can completely dry up in a crisis, I think is a more sustainable model.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the first quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explained why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.

For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $575 million, earnings per share of $1.35 and a return on equity of 21%. Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year, which now brings us into the lower end of our targeted range for 2016. Specifically, we grew card receivables by 4%, accelerating year-over-year growth versus the fourth quarter. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased.
Our brand, rewards and overall value proposition remained focused on the prime revolver segment, which we believe is the most profitable part of the card market.
Card sales grew by 4% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 6%, which shows that the lower gas prices at the pump remain a drag on card sales.
Also I'll point out that leap year in the first quarter added roughly 1% to sales growth.
Last quarter, we were recognize as highest in Customer Loyalty in the annual Brand Key survey. This marks the 20th consecutive year that we've earned the top spot. I believe our focus on the customer has allowed us to have some of the lowest attrition rates in the industry and will continue to allow us to grow loans profitably.
Our other lending products are performing well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15% and personal loans grew 9% over the prior year. The strong organic student that loan growth was driven by disbursements related to students going back-to-school for the second semester and our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover student loans.
On the funding side, I'm very pleased with the 6% sequential increase in direct-to-consumer deposits. Our consumer deposits grew approximately $2 billion and made up 45% of funding at the quarter end. We capture the growth as investments in marketing over the last several months delivered positive results, specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our Payments business. Total volume for the segment declined as increases in Network Partners and Diners Club volume were offset by year-over-year declines in debit volume at PULSE. We believe PULSE volumes will stabilize at approximately current levels for the remainder of the year.
Lastly, in Payments, we continue to leverage our proprietary network to deliver great returns in our card issuing business and are pleased with increasing domestic and global acceptance.
Overall, it was a good quarter and we're making progress against our key focus areas for the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk you through the details of our first quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interes",1034,"Thanks, David good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased to $68 million to $474 million. The prior year's results included $42 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that is absent this year as we subsequently exited the business.
Net discount and interchange revenue was up 2%, driven by increased sales partially offset by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 106 basis points, up 4 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards. Sequentially, the rewards rate was down 12 basis points. The fourth quarter typically represents a seasonal high and also included the Apple Pay rewards bonus.
Protection products revenue declined $10 million as new product sales remain suspended. Sequentially, protection products revenue was relatively flat. However, we continue to expect some runoff this year.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $6 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party assure. Overall, we grew total company revenues by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.69% was 32 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 37 basis point increase in card yield. They year-over-year increasing yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of the prime rate increase in December.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposit 9% and we've contemplate -- we've completed 2 ABS deals year-to-date. Funding costs increased only 8 basis points, partly as a result of fixed-rate debt issuances in the last year muting the impact of rising rates.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 25 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. We achieved good acceleration in card loan growth through stronger sales and an increased revolved rate, so we did not feel a need to increase our promotional mix during the quarter. However, looking forward, we may yet choose to invest some of this NIM benefit to drive continued loan growth.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. Last year's results included $37 million in expense associated with the direct mortgage origination business, more than half of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses decreased $20 million due in part to the timing of card marketing as well as the elimination of mortgage marketing activities. Professional fees increased $33 million to $160 million as expenses associated with the AML/BSA look back project totaled approximately $30 million for the quarter. We expect the look back project cost to be largely complete in the first half of this year.
And finally, other expense was lower as the prior year included a $20 million addition to the legal reserve.
For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was about 40%. However, if you exclude the $30 million look back project expense I mentioned a moment ago, total company efficiency ratio was roughly 38.5%. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $34 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $52 million, while last year we had a $30 million reserve build. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.34% decreased by 6 basis points year-over-year and increased 16 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.68% increased 4 basis points year-over-year and was down 4 basis points sequentially.
On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Moving to private student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, decreased 18 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from the benign credit environment as well as a couple of items that we've discussed in the past, specifically more effective collection strategies as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year.
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 26 basis points to 1.92% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come in to repayments. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues the season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 21 basis points to 97 basis points. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates was primarily driven by the expected seasoning of recent loan growth.
Next I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.2% due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. This ratio declined 50 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased nearly 2% of our common stock.
Lastly, while we did not recognize any material tax benefits this period, there will be a favorable resolution to an outstanding tax matter which will have the onetime effect of lowering effective tax rate for the second quarter.
In summary, it feels like a good start to the year with a strong margin and good loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. We expect to see provisioning loan growth and we'll continue to work diligently to manage the core expense base as we absorb increasing regulatory and compliance costs.
That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Connor, to open the line up for Q&A. Connor?"

Also some of our new features have been well-received, whether it's some of our cashback, Freeze It, continued take-up of free FICO scores.

The other thing I would say is there's, obviously, some timing of spend, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that occurs throughout the course of the year. The first quarter was not a particularly high point from a marketing standpoint. And then the other thing I would just point out is in the year-over-year comparison, we did have the mortgage marketing spend in their last year, which I would remind you kind of have to peel back out for comparability. So those are really kind of the bits and pieces, puts and takes. I mean, I think, ultimately, we continue to have a very disciplined approach to marketing spend, we want to make sure we're getting the results we see for it.

We are working to optimize all of the levers that you just cited. And the 1 I would probably add because I think it's not just about money, the execution, things like new features that may not cost that much money, but may move behavior, is a fourth lever that I would add. And I think if you look at what we've produced in terms of innovation the last couple of years compared to others, like Freeze It and free FICO and on and on, I think that innovation is one of the best place to move the dial."

We really haven't seen, I haven't seen much acceleration on the prime space, I mean, it stops shrinking. But my best guess is it's growing 2% to 3% in prime credit scores today. If you see where the acceleration has come, it's come in the issuers who are in the sub-prime space, including private label, which obviously, a lot of people get there new to credit. So there's a high correlation between the high yield competitors and the higher growth competitors at the moment. If you look at -- if you just isolate the prime competitors, some are still shrinking a little bit. And so I think it's been and so how that plays out is and we're not a sub-prime player, but how does the sub-prime credit play out and impact those competitors over time, I'm not an expert on that.

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.

We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.

For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $575 million, earnings per share of $1.35 and a return on equity of 21%. Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year, which now brings us into the lower end of our targeted range for 2016. Specifically, we grew card receivables by 4%, accelerating year-over-year growth versus the fourth quarter. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased.
Our brand, rewards and overall value proposition remained focused on the prime revolver segment, which we believe is the most profitable part of the card market.
Card sales grew by 4% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 6%, which shows that the lower gas prices at the pump remain a drag on card sales. Also, I'll point out that leap year in the first quarter added roughly 1% to sales growth.
Last quarter, we were recognized as highest in customer loyalty in the annual Brand Keys survey. This marks the 20th consecutive year that we've earned the top spot. I believe our focus on the customer has allowed us to have some of the lowest attrition rates in the industry and will continue to allow us to grow loans profitably.
Our other lending products are performing well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15% and personal loans grew 9% over the prior year. The strong organic student loan growth was driven by disbursements related to students going back to school for the second semester and our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover student loans.
On the funding side, I'm very pleased with the 6% sequential increase in direct-to-consumer deposits. Our consumer deposits grew approximately $2 billion and made up 45% of funding at the quarter end. We captured the growth as investments in marketing over the last several months delivered positive results, specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our Payments business. Total volume for the segment declined as increases in Network Partners and Diners Club volume were offset by year-over-year declines in debit volume at PULSE. We believe PULSE volumes will stabilize at approximately current levels for the remainder of the year.
Lastly, in Payments, we continue to leverage our proprietary network to deliver great returns in our card issuing business and are pleased with increasing domestic and global acceptance.
Overall, it was a good quarter and we're making progress against our key focus areas for the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk you through the details of our first quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net in",1036,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased to $68 million to $474 million. The prior year's results included $42 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that is absent this year as we subsequently exited the business.
Net discount interchange revenue was up 2%, driven by increased sales partially offset by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 106 basis points, up 4 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards. Sequentially, the rewards rate was down 12 basis points. The fourth quarter typically represents a seasonal high and also included the Apple Pay rewards bonus.
Protection products revenue declined $10 million as new product sales remain suspended. Sequentially, protection products revenue was relatively flat. However, we continue to expect some runoff this year.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $6 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenues by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.69% was 32 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 37 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of the prime rate increase in December.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits 9% and we've contemplate -- we've completed 2 ABS deals year-to-date. Funding costs increased only 8 basis points, partly as a result of fixed-rate debt issuances in the last year muting the impact of rising rates.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 25 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. We achieved good acceleration in card loan growth through stronger sales and an increased revolve rate, so we did not feel a need to increase our promotional mix during the quarter. However, looking forward, we may yet choose to invest some of this NIM benefit to drive continued loan growth.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. Last year's results included $37 million in expense associated with the direct mortgage origination business, more than half of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses decreased $20 million due in part to the timing of card marketing as well as the elimination of mortgage marketing activities. Professional fees increased $33 million to $160 million as expenses associated with the AML/BSA look-back project totaled approximately $30 million for the quarter. We expect the look-back project cost to be largely complete in the first half of this year. And finally, other expense was lower as the prior year included a $20 million addition to the legal reserve.
For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was about 40%. However, if you exclude the $30 million look-back project expense I mentioned a moment ago, total company efficiency ratio was roughly 38.5%. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $34 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $52 million, while last year we had a $30 million reserve build. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.34% decreased by 6 basis points year-over-year and increased 16 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.68% increased 4 basis points year-over-year and was down 4 basis points sequentially.
On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Moving to private student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, decreased 18 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from the benign credit environment as well as a couple of items that we've discussed in the past, specifically more effective collection strategies as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year.
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 26 basis points to 1.92% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come in to repayments. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 21 basis points to 97 basis points. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the expected seasoning of recent loan growth.
Next I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.2% due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. This ratio declined 50 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased nearly 2% of our common stock.
Lastly, while we did not recognize any material tax benefits this period, there will be a favorable resolution to an outstanding tax matter which will have the onetime effect of lowering the effective tax rate for the second quarter.
In summary, it feels like a good start to the year with a strong margin and good loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. We expect to see provisioning driven by loan growth and we'll continue to work diligently to manage the core expense base as we absorb increasing regulatory and compliance costs.
That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Connor, to open the line up for Q&A. Connor?"

So I'm pleased that all of our various actions have moved us into that lower end of the range and we're certainly taking efforts to continue to move higher in that range if we're able to later this year. And I'd say those efforts include, I mentioned more new accounts, we are continuing to look for places where we can appropriately increase credit lines or extend credit where we're going to -- where we expect good and are achieving good results. Also some of our new features have been well-received, whether it's some of our Cashback, Freeze It, continued great take-up of free FICO scores.

The first quarter was not a particularly high point from a marketing spend standpoint. And then the other thing I would just point out is in the year-over-year comparison, we did have the mortgage marketing spend in their last year, which I would remind you, you kind of have to peel back out for comparability. So those are really kind of the bits and pieces, puts and takes. I mean, I think ultimately we continue to have a very disciplined approach to marketing spend.

So we would have a decided bias to continue leaning into deposit growth, I would say. That being said, it takes time to grow deposits, especially relationship-oriented deposits. You can grow them really fast by hanging out the highest rate in town, but that's also got a beta of 1. So -- and we're trying to do it the old-fashioned way where it adds real value.

In terms of the 1% de minimis ask, I think it is tended to be utilized by people, primarily around what I would call unexpected events that weren't contemplated in capital plans, compensation dilution being one that comes to mind that I've seen a few folks do and a number of other things as well. We would not be hesitant to use something like that if we had a like-type event or a similar event of some kind come along.

If you see where the acceleration has come, it's come in the issuers who are in the sub-prime space, including private label, which obviously, a lot of people get. They're new to credit. So there's a high correlation between the high yield competitors and the higher growth competitors at the moment. If you look at -- if you just isolate the prime competitors, some are still shrinking a little bit. And so I think it's been -- and so how that plays out is we're not a sub-prime player, but how does the sub-prime credit play out and impact those competitors over time, I'm not an expert on that.

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the first quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explained why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
So now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $575 million, earnings per share of $1.35 and a return on equity of 21%. Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year, which now brings us into the lower end of our targeted range for 2016. Specifically, we grew card receivables by 4%, accelerating year-over-year growth versus the fourth quarter. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased.
Our brand, rewards and overall value proposition remained focused on the prime revolver segment, which we believe is the most profitable part of the card market.
Card sales grew by 4% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 6%, which shows that the lower gas prices at the pump remain a drag on card sales. Also, I'll point out that leap year in the first quarter added roughly 1% to sales growth.
Last quarter, we were recognized as highest in customer loyalty in the annual Brand Keys survey. This marks the 20th consecutive year that we've earned the top spot. I believe our focus on the customer has allowed us to have some of the lowest attrition rates in the industry and will continue to allow us to grow loans profitably.
Our other lending products are performing well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15% and personal loans grew 9% over the prior year. The strong organic student loan growth was driven by disbursements related to students going back to school for the second semester and our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover student loans.
On the funding side, I'm very pleased with the 6% sequential increase in direct-to-consumer deposits. Our consumer deposits grew approximately $2 billion and made up 45% of funding at the quarter end. We captured the growth as investments in marketing over the last several months delivered positive results, specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our Payments business. Total volume for the segment declined as increases in Network Partners and Diners Club volume were offset by year-over-year declines in debit volume at PULSE. We believe PULSE volumes will stabilize at approximately current levels for the remainder of the year.
Lastly, in Payments, we continue to leverage our proprietary network to deliver great returns in our card issuing business and are pleased with the increasing domestic and global acceptance.
Overall, it was a good quarter and we're making progress against our key focus areas for the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk you through the details of our first quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net in",1036,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased to $68 million to $474 million. The prior year's results included $42 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that is absent this year as we subsequently exited the business.
Net discount interchange revenue was up 2%, driven by increased sales partially offset by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 106 basis points, up 4 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards. Sequentially, the rewards rate was down 12 basis points. The fourth quarter typically represents a seasonal high and also included the Apple Pay rewards bonus.
Protection products revenue declined $10 million as new product sales remain suspended. Sequentially, protection products revenue was relatively flat. However, we continue to expect some runoff this year.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $6 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenues by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.69% was 32 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 37 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of the prime rate increase in December.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits 9% and we've contemplate -- we've completed 2 ABS deals year-to-date. Funding costs increased only 8 basis points, partly as a result of fixed-rate debt issuances in the last year muting the impact of rising rates.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 25 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. We achieved good acceleration in card loan growth through stronger sales and an increased revolve rate, so we did not feel a need to increase our promotional mix during the quarter. However, looking forward, we may yet choose to invest some of this NIM benefit to drive continued loan growth.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. Last year's results included $37 million in expense associated with the direct mortgage origination business, more than half of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses decreased $20 million due in part to the timing of card marketing as well as the elimination of mortgage marketing activities. Professional fees increased $33 million to $160 million as expenses associated with the AML/BSA look-back project totaled approximately $30 million for the quarter. We expect the look-back project costs to be largely complete in the first half of this year. And finally, other expense was lower as the prior year included a $20 million addition to the legal reserve.
For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was about 40%. However, if you exclude the $30 million look-back project expense I mentioned a moment ago, total company efficiency ratio was roughly 38.5%. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $34 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $52 million, while last year we had a $30 million reserve build. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.34% decreased by 6 basis points year-over-year and increased 16 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.68% increased 4 basis points year-over-year and was down 4 basis points sequentially.
On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Moving to private student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, decreased 18 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from the benign credit environment as well as a couple of items that we've discussed in the past, specifically more effective collection strategies as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year.
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 26 basis points to 1.92% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come in to repayments. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 21 basis points to 97 basis points. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the expected seasoning of recent loan growth.
Next I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.2% due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. This ratio declined 50 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased nearly 2% of our common stock.
Lastly, while we did not recognize any material tax benefits this period, there will be a favorable resolution to an outstanding tax matter which will have the onetime effect of lowering the effective tax rate for the second quarter.
In summary, it feels like a good start to the year with a strong margin and good loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. We expect to see provisioning driven by loan growth and we'll continue to work diligently to manage the core expense base as we absorb increasing regulatory and compliance costs.
That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Connor, to open the line up for Q&A. Connor?"

I would say, it's paid dividends not only in the form of growth in -- from balances from new accounts, but also growth in formerly dormant accounts that have reactivated, also showed good contribution to growth in that regard."

I guess, what I would say is on the tax line itself, it looks to be kind of a mid-8-figure kind of number for the quarter -- in the quarter that we would indeed recognize. So I think that probably gives you a good triangulation for how to think about it."

We didn't end up doing that as it turned out because we saw a growth reaccelerating along the lines of what we are hoping for from a cadence perspective. So I think I would say as you look forward over this year, I'd kind of discourage you from flattening NIM out and just kind of saying, this is where it will be for the rest of the year. I think there would be relative stability in NIM, but it could be affected by promotional activity, that revolving behavior Sanjay asked about a second ago and, obviously, any further moves the Fed makes because of that positive bias in positioning."

Well, I think that the best indicator that our efforts are working in total is just to look at actual loan growth. And so we accelerated from just over 3% to about 4% year-over-year.

And so we accelerated from just over 3% to about 4% year-over-year. And as you know, we had just established a new longer -- higher 4% to 6% full year target also for total loan growth, also for long term to be in that target. So I'm pleased that all of our various actions have moved us into that lower end of the range and we're certainly taking efforts to continue to move higher in that range if we're able to later this year. And I'd say those efforts include, I mentioned more new accounts, we are continuing to look for places where we can appropriately increase credit lines or extend credit where we're going to -- where we expect good and are achieving good results. Also some of our new features have been well-received, whether it's some of our Cashback, Freeze It, continued great take-up of free FICO scores. So I'd say that we have -- I don't think there's a single home run kind of initiative for loan growth, but a whole lot of singles that we are working on across the franchise."

I would not encourage anyone to expect a reserve release in the second quarter. By the same token, I would not encourage anyone to assume there's going to be some giant takeoff in provisioning in the second quarter either.

So just -- I'd take you back to a second in my prepared remarks where I said roughly a 40% efficiency ratio all-in, but if you exclude that look-back that we expect to bleed off after next quarter, we're printing about a 38.5% efficiency ratio this quarter. Now I think expenses are never flat. I think next quarter they may be inflated a little bit as we bring some things across the goal line and all, but I would stand by the expense guidance we gave at the beginning of the year."

And as we're leaning a little bit more into rewards rate with our double new account promotion and some of the other things we're doing, I think we're viewing that as interchangeable with the marketing spend. So to some degree, some of the decline in marketing spend you see is related to that. The other thing I would say is there's obviously some timing of spend, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that occurs throughout the course of the year. The first quarter was not a particularly high point from a marketing spend standpoint. And then the other thing I would just point out is in the year-over-year comparison, we did have the mortgage marketing spend in their last year, which I would remind you, you kind of have to peel back out for comparability. So those are really kind of the bits and pieces, puts and takes. I mean, I think ultimately we continue to have a very disciplined approach to marketing spend. We want to make sure we're getting the results we see for it. Again, when we saw we weren't getting some of the results we were looking for through some of the listing sites and other channels last year, in the middle of the year, we pulled back on those because we want to make sure we're driving the kind of growth that's going to drive the right kind of long-term profitability."

And I would say, from the standpoint of the rewards perspective, it is down a little bit from where we were in the fourth quarter, but there's generally a peak seasonality effect in the fourth quarter.

So that's why we're focusing in that particular area and why it has driven it. With respect to ABS transactions, I would say the answer is, yes, there has been some impact obviously with respect to what's happened in the marketplace in terms of credit spreads. Overall, I would say our credit spreads are up roughly call it 30 basis points year-over-year in addition to the -- just the base rate changes, if you will, the index rate changes that have taken place over the course of the last year. That being said, it's still a very robust market. We were in market last week, did something on the order of $1 billion, give or take. And actually, we're able to walk pricing in.

There's a couple reasons for that. The first of which is as we've talked, we've worked really hard over the last several years to really have a cross sold deposit base and we always like to use our balance sheet to support our customers. So I think that's one reason. The other reason is because of the betas, right? I mean, deposits do not reprice at the same rate as any of the capital market fundings do. So we would have a decided bias to continue leaning into deposit growth, I would say. That being said, it takes time to grow deposits, especially relationship-oriented deposits. You can grow them really fast by hanging out the highest rate in town, but that's also got a beta of 1. So -- and we're trying to do it the old-fashioned way where it adds real value. So I'd look for us to continue leaning into deposits, but I'm not so sure, 9% to 12% growth rate is the way to be thinking about it, but mid- to high single-digit growth rates sure sound good."

I think that's a very safe bet at this point in time based on the current trajectory of growth we're seeing."

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC and an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explained why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

For the second quarter, we reported net income of $616 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 11% year-over-year. These results included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $44 million, which contributed $0.11 to diluted earnings per share.
Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year, with a healthy net interest margin. In the Card business, we also grew receivables by 4%. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on their cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Card sales grew by 2% over the prior year, a bit lower than we would like. 
Our sales growth was outpaced by the growth in rewards. However, we're seeing benefits from the double rewards campaign in new accounts, sales from new accounts and in the cost to acquire these accounts. Along those lines, we set a post-recession record for new account -- new card accounts during the quarter, demonstrating that our brand rewards and overall value proposition continue to resonate with our target customers.
We believe these new accounts will contribute to future sales and loan growth. And to leverage our brand and increase consideration, we launched credit scorecard, which provides both current and prospective customers with access to their FICO score as well as a summary of the data that is helping and hurting their score. 
Our other direct banking products also performed well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15%, driven by our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover Student Loans. Personal loans grew 10% over the prior year, driven by digital investments and increased marketing, which have allowed us to drive growth while still maintaining an average FICO on new accounts of around 750. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of direct banking, I'm very pleased with the 16% growth in direct-to-consumer deposits. These deposits made up 47% of funding at quarter end. Our investments in marketing have continued to pay off, driving strong growth, specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our Payments business. PULSE volume declined 9% year-over-year. We expect PULSE volumes will stabilize around the end of the year. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 6%, driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
During the quarter, we received a lot of positive recognition from third parties. Two I'll highlight are that Fortune ranked us on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials. And Computerworld ranked us as one of the Top 100 Places to Work for IT professionals. We believe our commitment to treating our employees well translates into delivering the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.
Overall, it was a good quarter. We are making progress against our key focus areas for the year, and we were pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in the CCAR stress test results as well as overall capital returns planned for the year ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk through the details of our second quarter financial results. Mark?"

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net in",1032,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $74 million to $465 million. The prior year's results included $28 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that's absent this year as we are no longer in that business.
Net discount interchange revenue was down 11%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 121 basis points, up 16 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards, which David noted are helping attract new accounts. Sequentially, the rewards rate was up 15 basis points, driven by higher enrollment and spending in the quarter's rotating 5% category.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $2 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party debit issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.72% was 37 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to the higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase. 
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $4 billion. Total funding costs increased only 8 basis points despite higher market rates as their impact was muted by last year's fixed-rate debt issuances and our growing direct-to-consumer deposit base.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 31 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect a relatively stable margin. But it will, of course, be impacted by any changes in our planned level of promotional activity, revolving behavior in the card portfolio and any future Fed actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were down $21 million over the prior year. Last year's results had $62 million in expense associated with the operation and closure of the direct mortgage origination business, about 1/3 of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses were flat as savings from the elimination of mortgage marketing activities were reinvested in other areas of the business. Professional fees fell $3 million. The workstreams underlying the AML/BSA lookback project were as expected, completed during the quarter at a cost of $12 million as compared to $19 million in the second quarter of last year. While the completion of these workstreams represents a milestone, I would remind you that we are continuing to enhance our compliance program to meet the terms of our consent orders.
Other expense was lower as the prior year included $23 million in one-time charges associated with the exit of the home loan business.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $106 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $28 million, while last year, we had a $41 million reserve release. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.39% increased by 11 basis points year-over-year and increased 5 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.63% increased 8 basis points year-over-year and was down 5 basis points sequentially.
On balance, the credit backdrop remains benign, and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Looking at student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to continued seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 25 basis points due primarily to seasonality. 
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayments and decreased 4 basis points sequentially. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 28 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, which was consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was flat sequentially. This ratio declined 20 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased approximately 2% of our common stock.
As David mentioned, we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our stress capital ratios in the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. We received a non-objection from the Fed with respect to our propose capital actions for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. As a result, we plan to repurchase almost $2 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months. And last week, our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share. At current share prices, this results in one of the highest total yields among CCAR participants.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM, saw increased rewards expense, primarily due to our double promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts, grew the proportion of funding we get from deposits and achieved a favorable outcome from the 2016 CCAR process. 
That concludes our formal remarks and now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Mike, to open the line up for Q&A."

There's a combination of rewards -- of returns and growth that you'd like to see. I think we are continuing to reserve the right to invest some of that margin strength we're seeing over the back half of the year. We currently haven't found any ways of doing it but from an NPV perspective really made sense for us. That's why we're continuing to guide to a relatively stable margin at this point in time. But giving ourselves the ability, I guess, to change that if we see a need to going forward. One of the things we did do is we did go ahead and reinvest the marketing spend from last year that we had in the direct mortgage business into some of the other businesses. You might see us lean into marketing expense a little bit as we go forward into the back half of the year relative to what you've seen from us lately. But we're pleased with the revolver sales growth we're seeing right now and pleased with the trajectory of NIM and loan growth."

The cards and personal loans both tend to peak charge-offs about 24 months after your originate them. If you think about it, limit the vintage from 2 years ago is right at that peak the minutes from last year's climbing the hill and the from 3 years ago is still pretty high under the curve but dropping off. So as we've continued to originate more new accounts every year successively since the crisis, the area under that curve grows because the vintage falling out of that peak is a smaller than the one that's climbing the help. So I think it's really the compounding effect that's the driver. I wouldn't expect, as long as we're able to continue driving loan growth the levels we are right now and keep solid new account production across the products, I wouldn't expect to see us flip to a situation where we fall into a reserve release or a and net neutral reserve position at least not any for length of time."

And I think post-CARD Act, the issuers may be a little careful on how much they want to reduce their credit standards or how much of they want to reduce their APRs. But they may feel like they can, at least for now, go with some high rewards rates and maybe in the future, they have to adjust them down.

I'd say overall, there are certainly risks, as you say. It is a bit of a hot button. Politically, there tends to be confusion between the large federal student loan program, which is most of the lending and, if not, underwritten and not publicized credit issues versus the private loans, which are continuing to perform well. But sometimes people in the press will mix up those 2 things. And so I still believe that there's opportunity, the private student loans only make up about 6% of new student loan originations. And if the government ever pulls back at all, that could be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I don't think we're at that point right now, but someday, that may happen, I believe. But there are also -- there's also plenty of scrutiny around that business because it's very important. But as long as tuition continues to grow faster, I think there's a need for it.

I'm most hard-pressed to see how to craft the path for you for how long it's going to take to get there. I think the one thing we've said over and over again and will commit to is we're not going to do anything crazy with it just because we haven't.

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC and an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explained why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

For the second quarter, we reported net income of $616 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 11% year-over-year. These results included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $44 million, which contributed $0.11 to diluted earnings per share.
Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year with a healthy net interest margin.
In the card business, we also grew receivables by 4%. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on their cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Card sales grew by 2% over the prior year, a bit lower than we would like.
Our sales growth was outpaced by the growth in rewards. However, we're seeing benefits from the double rewards campaign on new accounts, sales from new accounts and in the cost to acquire these accounts. Along those lines, we set a post-recession record for new account -- new card accounts during the quarter, demonstrating that our brand, rewards and overall value proposition continue to resonate with our target customers.
We believe these new accounts will contribute to future sales and loan growth. And to leverage our brand and increase consideration, we launched Credit Scorecard, which provides both current and prospective customers with access to their FICO score as well as a summary of the data that is helping and hurting their score.
Our other direct banking products also performed well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15%, driven by our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover Student Loans. Personal loans grew 10% over the prior year, driven by digital investments and increased marketing, which have allowed us to drive growth while still maintaining an average FICO on new accounts of around 750. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of direct banking, I'm very pleased with the 16% growth in direct-to-consumer deposits. These deposits made up 47% of funding at quarter end. Our investments in marketing have continued to pay off, driving strong growth specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our payments business. PULSE volume declined 9% year-over-year. We expect PULSE volumes will stabilize around the end of the year. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year with Diners Club volume increasing 6%, driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
During the quarter, we received a lot of positive recognition from third parties. Two I'll highlight are that Fortune ranked us on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials and Computerworld ranked us as 1 of the top 100 places to work for IT professionals. We believe our commitment to treating our employees well translates into delivering the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.
Overall, it was a good quarter. We are making progress against our key focus areas for the year, and we were pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in the CCAR stress test results as well as overall capital returns planned for the year ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he'll walk through the details of our second quarter financial results. Mark?"

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net in",1032,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $74 million to $465 million. The prior year's results included $28 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that's absent this year as we are no longer in that business.
Net discount and interchange revenue was down 11%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 121 basis points, up 16 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards, which David noted are helping attract new accounts. Sequentially, the rewards rate was up 15 basis points driven by higher enrollment in spending in the quarter's rotating 5% category.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $2 million from the prior year mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party debit issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.72% was 37 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to the higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $4 billion. Total funding costs increased only 8 basis points despite higher market rates as their impact was muted by last year's fixed-rate debt issuances and our growing direct-to-consumer deposit base.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 31 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect a relatively stable margin, but it will, of course, be impacted by any changes in our planned level of promotional activity, revolving behavior in the card portfolio and any future Fed actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were down $21 million over the prior year. Last year's results had $62 million in expense associated with the operation and closure of the direct mortgage origination business, about 1/3 of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses were flat as savings from the elimination of mortgage marketing activities were reinvested in other areas of the business. Professional fees fell $3 million. The workstreams underlying the AML/BSA look-back project were, as expected, completed during the quarter at a cost of $12 million as compared to $19 million in the second quarter of last year. While the completion of these workstreams represents a milestone, I would remind you that we are continuing to enhance our compliance program to meet the terms of our consent orders. Other expense was lower as the prior year included $23 million in onetime charges associated with the exit of the home loan business.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $106 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $28 million, while last year, we had a $41 million reserve release. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.39% increased by 11 basis points year-over-year and increased 5 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.63% increased 8 basis points year-over-year and was down 5 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop remains benign, and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Looking at student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to continued seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 25 basis points due primarily to seasonality.
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment and decreased 4 basis points sequentially. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 28 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, which was consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was flat sequentially. This ratio declined 20 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased approximately 2% of our common stock.
As David mentioned, we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our stress capital ratios in the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. We received a non-objection from the Fed with respect to our propose capital actions for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. As result, we plan to repurchase almost $2 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months. And last week, our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share. At current share prices, this results in one of the highest total yields among CCAR participants.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM; saw increased rewards expense primarily due to our double promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts; grew the proportion of funding we get from deposits; and achieved a favorable outcome from the 2016 CCAR process.
That concludes our formal remarks, and now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Mike, to open the line up for Q&A."

There's a combination of rewards and -- of returns and growth that you'd like to see. I think we are continuing to reserve the right to invest some of that margin strength we're seeing over the back half of the year. We currently haven't found any ways of doing it that from an NPV perspective really made sense for us. That's why we're continuing to guide to a relatively stable margin at this point in time but giving ourselves the ability, I guess, to change that if we see a need to going forward. One of the things we did do is we did go ahead and reinvest the marketing spend from last year that we had in the direct mortgage business into some of the other businesses. You might see us lean into marketing expense a little bit as we go forward into the back half of the year relative to what you've seen from us lately. But we're pleased with the revolver sales growth we're seeing right now and pleased with the trajectory of NIM and loan growth."

However, we would like to be -- we would like it to be a bit higher than what we saw in the second quarter. And so we are hopeful that the number of the actions that we've been taking, whether it's more new accounts, focusing on engagement with our cash rewards program and other actions to help stimulate some sales volume, will move the sales volume up a bit over the coming quarters as well."

Betsy, I think, at this point in time, the -- what you're really dealing with is the compounding effect of the loan growth as opposed to just the last quarter or 2's loan growth that's really driving that reserving. The cards and personal loans both tend to take peak charge-offs about 24 months after you originate them. So if you think about it, the vintage from 2 years ago is right at that peak. The vintage from last year is climbing the hill, and the vintage from 3 years ago is still pretty high under the curve but dropping off. So as we've continued to originate more new accounts every year successively since the crisis, the area under that curve grows because the vintage falling out of that peak is smaller than the one that's climbing the hill. So I think it's really the compounding effect of that, that's the driver. I wouldn't expect -- as long as we're able to continue driving loan growth, the levels we are right now and keep solid new account production across the products, I wouldn't expect to see us flip to a situation where we fall into a reserve release or a net neutral reserve position at least not for any length of time."

I would say also that the low rate environment and the low return environment in banking is part of what I believe is causing greater competition in cards and specifically in rewards. And I think post-CARD Act, the issuers may be a little careful on how much they want to reduce their credit standards or how much they want to reduce their APRs. But they may feel like they can, at least for now go with some high rewards rates, and maybe in the future, they have to adjust them down. And our focus -- so I think the low rate environment is driving kind of some of that competition.

I'd say, overall, there are certainly risks as you say. It is a bit of a hot button. Politically, there tends to be confusion between the large federal student loan program, which is most of the lending and if not, underwritten and has well-publicized credit issues versus the private loans, which are continuing to perform well. But sometimes, people in the press will mix up those 2 things. And so I still believe that there's opportunity. The private student loans only make up about 6% of new student loan originations. And if the government ever pulls back at all, that could be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I don't think we're at that point right now but someday, that may happen I believe. But there are also -- there's also plenty of scrutiny around that business because it's very important. But as long as tuition continues to grow faster, I think there's a need for it.

I think we're comfortable with loan growth in the range we're seeing right now. We'd like to see it be a little bit higher into the range obviously as David noted. But I think loan growth is consuming a chunk of that. I feel really good about going through the CCAR process and producing 1 of the highest yields among all the participants, buying back close to 8% of shares on an annualized basis if you look at last quarter. I'm most hard pressed to see how to craft the path for you for how long it's going to take to get there. I think the one thing we've said over and over again and will commit to is we're not going to do anything crazy with it just because we have it. We recognize it's our investors' capital and not ours, and we will treat it appropriately. We continue to look for ways to return more of it. Every year, we've gotten more aggressive in that CCAR ask. Over the year prior, I think a reasonable person could assume that, that process doesn't -- wouldn't deviate in our current thoughts as we look forward either. But exactly how long it's going to take to get there, I just don't know how to answer that question."

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC and an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

For the second quarter, we reported net income of $616 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 11% year-over-year. These results included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $44 million, which contributed $0.11 to diluted earnings per share.
Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year with a healthy net interest margin.
In the card business, we also grew receivables by 4%. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on their cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Card sales grew by 2% over the prior year, a bit lower than we would like.
Our sales growth was outpaced by the growth in rewards. However, we're seeing benefits from the double rewards campaign on new accounts, sales from new accounts and in the cost to acquire these accounts. Along those lines, we set a post-recession record for new account -- new card accounts during the quarter, demonstrating that our brand, rewards and overall value proposition continue to resonate with our target customers.
We believe these new accounts will contribute to future sales and loan growth. And to leverage our brand and increase consideration, we launched Credit Scorecard, which provides both current and prospective customers with access to their FICO score as well as a summary of the data that is helping and hurting their score.
Our other direct banking products also performed well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15%, driven by our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover Student Loans. Personal loans grew 10% over the prior year, driven by digital investments and increased marketing, which have allowed us to drive growth while still maintaining an average FICO on new accounts of around 750. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of direct banking, I'm very pleased with the 16% growth in direct-to-consumer deposits. These deposits made up 47% of funding at quarter end. Our investments in marketing have continued to pay off, driving strong growth specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our payments business. PULSE volume declined 9% year-over-year. We expect PULSE volumes will stabilize around the end of the year. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year with Diners Club volume increasing 6%, driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
During the quarter, we received a lot of positive recognition from third parties. Two I'll highlight are that Fortune ranked us on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials and Computerworld ranked us as 1 of the top 100 places to work for IT professionals. We believe our commitment to treating our employees well translates into delivering the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.
Overall, it was a good quarter. We are making progress against our key focus areas for the year, and we were pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in the CCAR stress test results as well as overall capital returns planned for the year ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he'll walk through the details of our second quarter financial results. Mark?"

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net in",1032,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $74 million to $465 million. The prior year's results included $28 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that's absent this year as we are no longer in that business.
Net discount and interchange revenue was down 11%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 121 basis points, up 16 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards, which David noted are helping attract new accounts. Sequentially, the rewards rate was up 15 basis points driven by higher enrollment in spending in the quarter's rotating 5% category.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $2 million from the prior year mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party debit issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.72% was 37 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to the higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $4 billion. Total funding costs increased only 8 basis points despite higher market rates as their impact was muted by last year's fixed-rate debt issuances and our growing direct-to-consumer deposit base.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 31 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect a relatively stable margin, but it will, of course, be impacted by any changes in our planned level of promotional activity, revolving behavior in the card portfolio and any future Fed actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were down $21 million over the prior year. Last year's results had $62 million in expense associated with the operation and closure of the direct mortgage origination business, about 1/3 of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses were flat as savings from the elimination of mortgage marketing activities were reinvested in other areas of the business. Professional fees fell $3 million. The workstreams underlying the AML/BSA look-back project were, as expected, completed during the quarter at a cost of $12 million as compared to $19 million in the second quarter of last year. While the completion of these workstreams represents a milestone, I would remind you that we are continuing to enhance our compliance program to meet the terms of our consent orders. Other expense was lower as the prior year included $23 million in onetime charges associated with the exit of the home loan business.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $106 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $28 million, while last year, we had a $41 million reserve release. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.39% increased by 11 basis points year-over-year and increased 5 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.63% increased 8 basis points year-over-year and was down 5 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop remains benign, and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Looking at student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to continued seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 25 basis points due primarily to seasonality.
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment and decreased 4 basis points sequentially. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 28 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, which was consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was flat sequentially. This ratio declined 20 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased approximately 2% of our common stock.
As David mentioned, we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our stress capital ratios in the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. We received a non-objection from the Fed with respect to our proposed capital actions for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. As result, we plan to repurchase almost $2 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months. And last week, our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share. At current share prices, this results in one of the highest total yields among CCAR participants.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM; saw increased rewards expense primarily due to our double promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts; grew the proportion of funding we get from deposits; and achieved a favorable outcome from the 2016 CCAR process.
That concludes our formal remarks, and now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Mike, to open the line up for Q&A."

There's a combination of rewards and -- of returns and growth that you'd like to see. I think we are continuing to reserve the right to invest some of that margin strength we're seeing over the back half of the year. We currently haven't found any ways of doing it that from an NPV perspective really made sense for us. That's why we're continuing to guide to a relatively stable margin at this point in time but giving ourselves the ability, I guess, to change that if we see a need to going forward. One of the things we did do is we did go ahead and reinvest the marketing spend from last year that we had in the direct mortgage business into some of the other businesses. You might see us lean into marketing expense a little bit as we go forward into the back half of the year relative to what you've seen from us lately. But we're pleased with the revolver sales growth we're seeing right now and pleased with the trajectory of NIM and loan growth."

Betsy, I think, at this point in time, the -- what you're really dealing with is the compounding effect of the loan growth as opposed to just the last quarter or 2's loan growth that's really driving that reserving. The cards and personal loans both tend to take peak charge-offs about 24 months after you originate them. So if you think about it, the vintage from 2 years ago is right at that peak. The vintage from last year is climbing the hill, and the vintage from 3 years ago is still pretty high under the curve but dropping off. So as we've continued to originate more new accounts every year successively since the crisis, the area under that curve grows because the vintage falling out of that peak is smaller than the one that's climbing the hill. So I think it's really the compounding effect of that, that's the driver. I wouldn't expect -- as long as we're able to continue driving loan growth, the levels we are right now and keep solid new account production across the products, I wouldn't expect to see us slip to a situation where we fall into a reserve release or a net neutral reserve position, at least not for any length of time."

I would say also that the low rate environment and the low return environment in banking is part of what I believe is causing greater competition in cards and specifically in rewards. And I think post-CARD Act, the issuers may be a little careful on how much they want to reduce their credit standards or how much they want to reduce their APRs. But they may feel like they can, at least for now, go with some high rewards rates, and maybe in the future, they have to adjust them down. And our focus -- so I think the low rate environment is driving kind of some of that competition.

I'd say, overall, there are certainly risks as you say. It is a bit of a hot button. Politically, there tends to be confusion between the large federal student loan program, which is most of the lending and is not underwritten and has well-publicized credit issues versus the private loans, which are continuing to perform well. But sometimes, people in the press will mix up those 2 things. And so I still believe that there's opportunity; that private student loans only make up about 6% of new student loan originations. And if the government ever pulled back at all, that could be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I don't think we're at that point right now but someday, that may happen I believe. But there are also -- there's also plenty of scrutiny around that business because it's very important. But as long as tuition continues to grow faster, I think there's a need for it.

I think we're comfortable with loan growth in the range we're seeing right now. We'd like to see it be a little bit higher into the range obviously as David noted. But I think loan growth is consuming a chunk of that. I feel really good about going through the CCAR process and producing 1 of the highest yields among all the participants, buying back close to 8% of shares on an annualized basis if you look at last quarter. I'm almost hard pressed to see how to craft the path for you for how long it's going to take to get there. I think the one thing we've said over and over again and will commit to is we're not going to do anything crazy with it just because we have it. We recognize it's our investors' capital and not ours, and we will treat it appropriately. We continue to look for ways to return more of it. Every year, we've gotten more aggressive in that CCAR ask. Over the year prior, I think a reasonable person could assume that, that process doesn't -- wouldn't deviate in our current thoughts as we look forward either. But exactly how long it's going to take to get there, I just don't know how to answer that question."

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC and an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the second quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

For the second quarter, we reported net income of $616 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 11% year-over-year. These results included a nonrecurring tax benefit of $44 million, which contributed $0.11 to diluted earnings per share.
Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year with a healthy net interest margin.
In the card business, we also grew receivables by 4%. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on their cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Card sales grew by 2% over the prior year, a bit lower than we would like.
Our sales growth was outpaced by the growth in rewards. However, we're seeing benefits from the double rewards campaign on new accounts, sales from new accounts and in the cost to acquire these accounts. Along those lines, we set a post-recession record for new account -- new card accounts during the quarter, demonstrating that our brand, rewards and overall value proposition continue to resonate with our target customers.
We believe these new accounts will contribute to future sales and loan growth. And to leverage our brand and increase consideration, we launched Credit Scorecard, which provides both current and prospective customers with access to their FICO score as well as a summary of the data that is helping and hurting their score.
Our other direct banking products also performed well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15%, driven by our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover Student Loans. Personal loans grew 10% over the prior year, driven by digital investments and increased marketing, which have allowed us to drive growth while still maintaining an average FICO on new accounts of around 750. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of direct banking, I'm very pleased with the 16% growth in direct-to-consumer deposits. These deposits made up 47% of funding at quarter end. Our investments in marketing have continued to pay off, driving strong growth specifically in savings accounts and balances.
Moving to our payments business. PULSE volume declined 9% year-over-year. We expect PULSE volumes will stabilize around the end of the year. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year with Diners Club volume increasing 6%, driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
During the quarter, we received a lot of positive recognition from third parties. Two I'll highlight are that Fortune ranked us on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials and Computerworld ranked us as 1 of the top 100 places to work for IT professionals. We believe our commitment to treating our employees well translates into delivering the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.
Overall, it was a good quarter. We are making progress against our key focus areas for the year, and we were pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in the CCAR stress test results as well as overall capital returns planned for the year ahead.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he'll walk through the details of our second quarter financial results. Mark?"

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net in",1032,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation.
Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $74 million to $465 million. The prior year's results included $28 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that's absent this year as we are no longer in that business.
Net discount and interchange revenue was down 11%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 121 basis points, up 16 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards, which David noted are helping attract new accounts. Sequentially, the rewards rate was up 15 basis points driven by higher enrollment in spending in the quarter's rotating 5% category.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue decreased $2 million from the prior year mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party debit issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 2% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.72% was 37 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 38 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to the higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $4 billion. Total funding costs increased only 8 basis points despite higher market rates as their impact was muted by last year's fixed-rate debt issuances and our growing direct-to-consumer deposit base.
Overall, net interest margin expanded 31 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect a relatively stable margin, but it will, of course, be impacted by any changes in our planned level of promotional activity, revolving behavior in the card portfolio and any future Fed actions.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were down $21 million over the prior year. Last year's results had $62 million in expense associated with the operation and closure of the direct mortgage origination business, about 1/3 of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases.
Marketing expenses were flat as savings from the elimination of mortgage marketing activities were reinvested in other areas of the business. Professional fees fell $3 million. The workstreams underlying the AML/BSA look-back project were, as expected, completed during the quarter at a cost of $12 million as compared to $19 million in the second quarter of last year. While the completion of these workstreams represents a milestone, I would remind you that we are continuing to enhance our compliance program to meet the terms of our consent orders. Other expense was lower as the prior year included $23 million in onetime charges associated with the exit of the home loan business.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $106 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $28 million, while last year, we had a $41 million reserve release. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.39% increased by 11 basis points year-over-year and increased 5 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.63% increased 8 basis points year-over-year and was down 5 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop remains benign, and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts.
Looking at student loans. The net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to continued seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 25 basis points due primarily to seasonality.
Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment and decreased 4 basis points sequentially. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 28 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, which was consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was flat sequentially. This ratio declined 20 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased approximately 2% of our common stock.
As David mentioned, we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our stress capital ratios in the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. We received a non-objection from the Fed with respect to our proposed capital actions for the 4 quarters ending June 30, 2017. As result, we plan to repurchase almost $2 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months. And last week, our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share. At current share prices, this results in one of the highest total yields among CCAR participants.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM; saw increased rewards expense primarily due to our double promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts; grew the proportion of funding we get from deposits; and achieved a favorable outcome from the 2016 CCAR process.
That concludes our formal remarks, and now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Mike, to open the line up for Q&A."

There's a combination of rewards and -- of returns and growth that you'd like to see. I think we are continuing to reserve the right to invest some of that margin strength we're seeing over the back half of the year. We currently haven't found any ways of doing it that from an NPV perspective really made sense for us. That's why we're continuing to guide to a relatively stable margin at this point in time but giving ourselves the ability, I guess, to change that if we see a need to going forward. One of the things we did do is we did go ahead and reinvest the marketing spend from last year that we had in the direct mortgage business into some of the other businesses. You might see us lean into marketing expense a little bit as we go forward into the back half of the year relative to what you've seen from us lately. But we're pleased with the revolver sales growth we're seeing right now and pleased with the trajectory of NIM and loan growth."

Betsy, I think, at this point in time, the -- what you're really dealing with is the compounding effect of the loan growth as opposed to just the last quarter or 2's loan growth that's really driving that reserving. The cards and personal loans both tend to take peak charge-offs about 24 months after you originate them. So if you think about it, the vintage from 2 years ago is right at that peak. The vintage from last year is climbing the hill, and the vintage from 3 years ago is still pretty high under the curve but dropping off. So as we've continued to originate more new accounts every year successively since the crisis, the area under that curve grows because the vintage falling out of that peak is smaller than the one that's climbing the hill. So I think it's really the compounding effect of that, that's the driver. I wouldn't expect -- as long as we're able to continue driving loan growth, the levels we are right now and keep solid new account production across the products, I wouldn't expect to see us slip to a situation where we fall into a reserve release or a net neutral reserve position, at least not for any length of time."

I would say also that the low rate environment and the low return environment in banking is part of what I believe is causing greater competition in cards and specifically in rewards. And I think post-CARD Act, the issuers may be a little careful on how much they want to reduce their credit standards or how much they want to reduce their APRs. But they may feel like they can, at least for now, go with some high rewards rates, and maybe in the future, they have to adjust them down.

I'd say, overall, there are certainly risks as you say. It is a bit of a hot button. Politically, there tends to be confusion between the large federal student loan program, which is most of the lending and is not underwritten and has well-publicized credit issues versus the private loans, which are continuing to perform well. But sometimes, people in the press will mix up those 2 things. And so I still believe that there's opportunity; that private student loans only make up about 6% of new student loan originations. And if the government ever pulled back at all, that could be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I don't think we're at that point right now but someday, that may happen I believe. But there are also -- there's also plenty of scrutiny around that business because it's very important. But as long as tuition continues to grow faster, I think there's a need for it.

I'm almost hard pressed to see how to craft the path for you for how long it's going to take to get there. I think the one thing we've said over and over again and will commit to is we're not going to do anything crazy with it just because we have it. We recognize it's our investors' capital and not ours, and we will treat it appropriately. We continue to look for ways to return more of it. Every year, we've gotten more aggressive in that CCAR ask. Over the year prior, I think a reasonable person could assume that, that process doesn't -- wouldn't deviate in our current thoughts as we look forward either.

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC and an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the third quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
So now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

For the third quarter, we reported net income of $639 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.56, including $0.07 of onetime tax benefits. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, with EPS up 13% year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. 
Our Direct Banking business continues to perform well, accelerating the pace of total loan growth to 5% over the prior year. In the card business, we grew receivables by 4%, once again much faster than card sales, which grew by 1% over the prior year. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we remain more disciplined than certain competitors in reward spend. And as a result, we have sacrificed some transactor sales volume. We are, however, taking some actions on rewards to accelerate card sales, but we are not tracing unprofitable volume. I'll remind you that loan growth, which drives most of our profits, is driven by revolver spend. Our product continues to resonate well with prime revolvers and that has allowed us to achieve loan growth in our target range. 
We are focused on delivering the best products to our customers and we are continuously innovating, testing and implementing new features and benefits, ways to serve our customers better and more efficiently and we offer rewards that provide real value to our card members. Our cards continued to be well regarded in the marketplace as evidenced by MONEY Magazine naming 3 of our cards Discover it, Discover it Miles, and Discover it Secured to their annual Best Credit Cards Used last month. 
I'll now move to our other Direct Banking products, which also delivered strong performance in the quarter. The organic student loan portfolio increased 14% with strong performance during this year's peak back-to-school period. Personal loans grew 16% over the prior year, driven by product enhancements and opportunistic marketing, which took advantage of pullbacks in advertising by some marketplace lenders. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016. 
On the funding side of our Direct Banking products, we increased direct-to-consumer deposits 19% over the prior year. This was driven by some of the highest retention rates we've achieved and we accelerated growth in new customer balances. 
The market rates have increased in the last year, our funding costs for direct-to-consumer deposits has remained relatively flat. 
Moving to our Payments business, PULSE volumes declined 6% year-over-year and were flat quarter-over-quarter, showing some volume stabilization. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 12% driven by continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about something we're very proud of here at Discover. In August, J.D. Power announced that Discover ranked highest in credit card customer satisfaction for the third straight year. I'd like to thank each of our 15,000 employees who continue to work hard to deliver the best possible value and experience to our cardmembers. 
Overall, it was a good quarter. We achieved record EPS, even excluding the onetime tax benefits. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk through the details of our third quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the presentation. 
Net interest income increased $140 million or 8% over the prior year, driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased to $27 million to $476 million. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9% driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate was consistent with the second quarter and up about 13 basis points from the prior year. The increase over last year is primarily driven by higher promotional rewards, principally our cashback match program, which helped to drive strong new account growth this quarter. We expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement in our target segments. And as a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in around 119 basis points for the full year 2016. 
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue was flat year-over-year as lower volumes at PULSE were offset primarily by lower incentives. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 5% for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.82% was 45 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 50-basis-point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio, as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase. 
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $5 billion to make up 46% of our total funding. Our funding costs increased 10 basis points driven by higher market rates, higher FDIC assessments due to large banks surcharge, and changes in funding mix as we extended the maturity profile of our broker deposits. Overall, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points from the prior year to 9.99%. 
For the fourth quarter, we currently expect net interest margin to be relatively flat. We may, however, utilize some of the healthy NIM toward promotional balance initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. I would remind you that last year's results had $23 million in expense associated with the wind down of the direct mortgage origination business. The largest driver behind the $5 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation you see in the table was higher headcount to support compliance activities. Marketing expenses were up $27 million as we made opportunistic investments, primarily in card but also in student and personal loans. Professional fees fell $17 million, primarily due to the completion of look-back related anti-money laundering remediation activities in the second quarter of 2016. 
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $75 million while last year, we had a much smaller build up of only $8 million. The credit card and net charge-off rate of 2.17% increased by 13 basis points year-over-year and fell 22 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.87% increased 22 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign. Reserving was primarily driven by the compounding effects of several years of consistent loan growth. 
Looking at private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate decreased 8 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, were relatively flat. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations. 
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 64 basis points from the prior year and 25-basis-point sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 18 basis points from the prior year and down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth and are consistent with our expectations. 
Next I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio declined sequentially, the ratio decreased 40 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.5% of our common stock, including the incremental $100 million we announced in August following the Federal Reserve's nonobjection to our de minimis request. 
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM, saw increased rewards expense, primarily due to our match promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts. And while provisions were a headwind, the consumer credit backdrop remains relatively stable. 
That concludes our formal remarks. Now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantelle, to open the line for Q&A."

I think it's a very model-driven process on the front end, which we apply some judgment on the back end, but that judgment is pretty rigid. In terms of how to think about and parse it up, I would say the biggest that's really driving some of the increase over the course of the last couple of quarters is the fact that over the last several years, you've had the back book of legacy loans, which is 3 years or more seasoned, it's over 80% of the book. We were getting really big improvements in that legacy back book. And it was masking the impact of the growth-driven provisioning that you're seeing from those new accounts that are 3 years or less on book. And as the legacy portfolio has really stabilized and isn't seeing further improvements in credit losses, that's what's really driving the impacts of provisioning you no longer have that muting effect. So I would echo our earlier comments, I would say the credit environment continues to feel very benign. We feel good about the environment and the originations we're doing in the environment today. And I would expect provisions into the foreseeable future really to continue to be driven more by the seasoning of loan growth and not buy any sensitive deterioration in the book."

So I think there's a lot still to come out in the details, shall we say, as we get it. But we took it is a positive signal. We have been very focused on increasing our payouts over time. And we clearly see nothing in the guidance that we've had thus far that would cause us to think we couldn't continue to look to increase these payouts. And, hopefully, as we see more details behind this, it will give us even a little bit more runway than we would otherwise hope to have had."

Looking at PULSE has been kind of a tough sector for quite a while for some obvious reasons. I guess, some have kind of suggested that there maybe some needs for a consolidation and tend to have it.

I think it has indeed been difficult not only for PULSE, but the other PIN networks given in particular some of the actions that Visa took following the government amendment. I guess, the good news is as I indicated in my point upfront, a lot of our volume loss in the last year or so was from one big customer, and we saw some stabilization of our PULSE volumes this quarter sequentially. And so I think I feel like we are, hopefully, through the worst of some of that challenge. But the constraints continue to be really difficult in terms of rules and how the migration to EMV cards as to what the rules are on the various issuers in the dominant players have. I think that consolidation is certainly possible. And at some point, I mean, we and first data to have by far and away the largest of the independent PIN networks. So one could argue that one or both of us might end up being in the good position to be the consolidators. But and I think we have some things to offer because we do have signature debit not just PIN debit, which is unique among all the independent PIN networks. But that being said, if at any point we decided we were not the best owner, we are focused on shareholders in doing the right thing to build shareholder value. So we'll continue to pursue lots of different options in the industry."

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report; and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.

We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

For the third quarter, we reported net income of $639 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.56, including $0.07 of onetime tax benefits. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, with EPS up 13% year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%.
Our Direct Banking business continues to perform well, accelerating the pace of total loan growth to 5% over the prior year. In the card business, we grew receivables by 4%, once again much faster than card sales, which grew by 1% over the prior year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we remain more disciplined than certain competitors in reward spend. And as a result, we have sacrificed some transactor sales volume. We are, however, taking some actions on rewards to accelerate card sales, but we are not chasing unprofitable volume. I'd remind you that loan growth, which drives most of our profits, is driven by revolver spend. Our product continues to resonate well with prime revolvers, and that has allowed us to achieve loan growth in our target range.
We are focused on delivering the best products to our customers, and we are continuously innovating, testing and implementing new features and benefits, ways to serve our customers better and more efficiently, and we offer rewards that provide real value to our card members. Our cards continue to be well regarded in the marketplace, as evidenced by MONEY Magazine naming 3 of our cards, Discover it, Discover it Miles and Discover it Secured, to their annual best credit cards list last month.
I'll now move to our other Direct Banking products, which also delivered strong performance in the quarter. The organic student loan portfolio increased 14%, with strong performance during this year's peak back-to-school period. Personal loans grew 16% over the prior year, driven by product enhancements and opportunistic marketing, which took advantage of pullbacks in advertising by some marketplace lenders. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of our Direct Banking products, we increased direct-to-consumer deposits 19% over the prior year. This was driven by some of the highest retention rates we've achieved, and we accelerated growth in new customer balances. Though market rates have increased in the last year, our funding costs for direct-to-consumer deposits has remained relatively flat. 
Moving to our payments business, PULSE volumes declined 6% year-over-year and were flat quarter-over-quarter, showing some volume stabilization. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 12% driven by continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
Finally, I'd like to talk about something we're very proud of here at Discover. In August, J.D. Power announced that Discover ranked highest in credit card customer satisfaction for the third straight year. I'd like to thank each of our 15,000 employees who continue to work hard to deliver the best possible value and experience to our cardmembers. 
Overall, it was a good quarter. We achieved record EPS, even excluding the onetime tax benefits.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he'll walk through the details of our third quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the presentation.
Net interest income increased $140 million or 8% over the prior year, driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $27 million to $476 million. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9% driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate was consistent with the second quarter and up about 13 basis points from the prior year. The increase over last year is primarily driven by higher promotional rewards, principally our Cashback Match program, which helped to drive strong new account growth this quarter. We expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement in our target segments. And as a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in around 119 basis points for the full year 2016.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue was flat year-over-year, as lower volumes at PULSE were offset primarily by lower incentives. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 5% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.82% was 45 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $5 billion to make up 46% of our total funding. Our funding costs increased 10 basis points driven by higher market rates, higher FDIC assessments due to large banks surcharge and changes in funding mix as we extended the maturity profile of our broker deposits. Overall, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points from the prior year to 9.99%.
For the fourth quarter, we currently expect net interest margin to be relatively flat. We may, however, utilize some of the healthy NIM toward promotional balanced growth initiatives.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. I would remind you that last year's results had $23 million in expense associated with the wind down of the direct mortgage origination business. The largest driver behind the $5 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation you see in the table was higher headcount to support compliance activities. Marketing expenses were up $27 million as we made opportunistic investments, primarily in card but also in student and personal loans. Professional fees fell $17 million, primarily due to the completion of look-back-related anti-money laundering remediation activities in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $75 million, while last year, we had a much smaller build of only $8 million. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.17% increased by 13 basis points year-over-year and fell 22 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.87% increased 22 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign. Reserving was primarily driven by the compounding effects of several years of consistent loan growth.
Looking at private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate decreased 8 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, were relatively flat. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 64 basis points from the prior year and 25 basis point sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 18 basis points from the prior year and down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth and are consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio declined sequentially. The ratio decreased 40 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.5% of our common stock, including the incremental $100 million we announced in August following the Federal Reserve's nonobjection to our de minimis request.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM; saw increased rewards expense, primarily due to our match promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts. And while provisions were a headwind, the consumer credit backdrop remains relatively stable.
That concludes our formal remarks. Now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantelle, to open the line for Q&A."

I think it's a very model-driven process on the front end, which we apply some judgment on the back end. But that judgment is pretty rigid. In terms of how to think about and parse it up, what I would say is the biggest string that's really driving some of the increase over the course of the last couple of quarters is the fact that over the last several years, you've had the back book of legacy loans, which is 3 years or more seasoned. It's over 80% of the book. We were getting really big improvements in that legacy back book. And it was masking the impact of the growth-driven provisioning that you're seeing from those new accounts that are 3 years or less on book. And as the legacy portfolio has really stabilized and isn't seeing further improvements in credit losses, that's what's really driving the impacts of provisioning. You no longer have that muting effect. So I would echo our earlier comments. I would say the credit environment continues to feel very benign. We feel good about the environment and the originations we're doing in the environment today. And I would expect provisions into the foreseeable future really to continue to be driven more by the seasoning of loan growth and not by any sense of deterioration in the book."

I think that it has indeed been difficult not only for PULSE, but the other PIN networks given in particular some of the actions that Visa took following the Durbin Amendment.

And so I think -- I feel like we're hopefully through the worst of some of that challenge. But the constraints continue to be really difficult in terms of rules and how the migration to EMV cards is, what the rules are on the various issuers that the dominant players have. I think that consolidation is certainly possible. And at some point -- I mean, we and First Data have by far and away the largest of the independent PIN networks. So one could argue that one or both of us might end up being in the good position to be the consolidators. But -- and I think we have some things to offer because we do have signature debit, not just PIN debit, which is unique among all the independent PIN networks. But that being said, if at any point we decided we were not the best owner, we are focused on shareholders and doing the right thing to build shareholder value.

I would say in terms of transactor attrition, it's a modest amount of it. It has been relatively consistent in terms of that contribution. Don't really want to forecast looking forward what's going to happen with transactor volume and transactor accounts, as candidly we don't want to attrite those transactors forever. So I think there'll be some element of that. But really the big drivers on the NIM expansion continues to be the card yield itself as well as that higher revolve rate, which is a component piece, as you know, that really is affected by that transactor mix. But I would also say it's been very effective management on the part of the treasury team and the deposits business on our funding costs, which has been really a huge contributor to the 37 basis point year-over-year increase in NIM that you see reported."

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us.
Let me begin with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report; and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.
In the third quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
So now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David."

For the third quarter, we reported net income of $639 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.56, including $0.07 of onetime tax benefits. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, with EPS up 13% year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%.
Our Direct Banking business continues to perform well, accelerating the pace of total loan growth to 5% over the prior year. In the card business, we grew receivables by 4%, once again much faster than card sales, which grew by 1% over the prior year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we remain more disciplined than certain competitors in reward spend. And as a result, we have sacrificed some transactor sales volume. We are, however, taking some actions on rewards to accelerate card sales, but we are not chasing unprofitable volume. I'd remind you that loan growth, which drives most of our profits, is driven by revolver spend. Our product continues to resonate well with prime revolvers, and that has allowed us to achieve loan growth in our target range.
We are focused on delivering the best products to our customers, and we are continuously innovating, testing and implementing new features and benefits, ways to serve our customers better and more efficiently, and we offer rewards that provide real value to our cardmembers. Our cards continue to be well regarded in the marketplace, as evidenced by MONEY Magazine naming 3 of our cards, Discover it, Discover it Miles and Discover it Secured, to their annual best credit cards list last month.
I'll now move to our other Direct Banking products, which also delivered strong performance in the quarter. The organic student loan portfolio increased 14%, with strong performance during this year's peak back-to-school period. Personal loans grew 16% over the prior year, driven by product enhancements and opportunistic marketing, which took advantage of pullbacks in advertising by some marketplace lenders. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of our Direct Banking products, we increased direct-to-consumer deposits 19% over the prior year. This was driven by some of the highest retention rates we've achieved, and we accelerated growth in new customer balances. Though market rates have increased in the last year, our funding costs for direct-to-consumer deposits has remained relatively flat. 
Moving to our payments business, PULSE volumes declined 6% year-over-year and were flat quarter-over-quarter, showing some volume stabilization. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 12% driven by continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
Finally, I'd like to talk about something we're very proud of here at Discover. In August, J.D. Power announced that Discover ranked highest in credit card customer satisfaction for the third straight year. I'd like to thank each of our 15,000 employees who continue to work hard to deliver the best possible value and experience to our card members. 
Overall, it was a good quarter. We achieved record EPS, even excluding the onetime tax benefits.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he'll walk through the details of our third quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the presentation.
Net interest income increased $140 million or 8% over the prior year, driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $27 million to $476 million. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9% driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate was consistent with the second quarter and up about 13 basis points from the prior year. The increase over last year is primarily driven by higher promotional rewards, principally our Cashback Match program, which helped to drive strong new account growth this quarter. We expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement in our target segments. And as a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in around 119 basis points for the full year 2016.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue was flat year-over-year, as lower volumes at PULSE were offset primarily by lower incentives. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 5% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.82% was 45 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $5 billion to make up 46% of our total funding. Our funding costs increased 10 basis points driven by higher market rates, higher FDIC assessments due to large banks surcharge and changes in funding mix as we extended the maturity profile of our broker deposits. Overall, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points from the prior year to 9.99%.
For the fourth quarter, we currently expect net interest margin to be relatively flat. We may, however, utilize some of the healthy NIM toward promotional balanced growth initiatives.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. I would remind you that last year's results had $23 million in expense associated with the wind down of the direct-to-mortgage origination business. The largest driver behind the $5 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation you see in the table was higher headcount to support compliance activities. Marketing expenses were up $27 million as we made opportunistic investments, primarily in card but also in student and personal loans. Professional fees fell $17 million, primarily due to the completion of look-back-related anti-money laundering remediation activities in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $75 million, while last year, we had a much smaller build of only $8 million. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.17% increased by 13 basis points year-over-year and fell 22 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.87% increased 22 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign. Reserving was primarily driven by the compounding effects of several years of consistent loan growth.
Looking at private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate decreased 8 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, were relatively flat. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 64 basis points from the prior year and 25 basis point sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 18 basis points from the prior year and down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth and are consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio declined sequentially. The ratio decreased 40 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.5% of our common stock, including the incremental $100 million we announced in August following the Federal Reserve's nonobjection to our de minimis request.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM; saw increased rewards expense, primarily due to our match promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts. And while provisions were a headwind, the consumer credit backdrop remains relatively stable.
That concludes our formal remarks. Now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantelle, to open the line for Q&A."

I think it's a very model-driven process on the front end, which we apply some judgment on the back end. But that judgment is pretty rigid. In terms of how to think about and parse it up, what I would say is the biggest string that's really driving some of the increase over the course of the last couple of quarters is the fact that over the last several years, you've had the back book of legacy loans, which is 3 years or more seasoned. It's over 80% of the book. We were getting really big improvements in that legacy back book. And it was masking the impact of the growth-driven provisioning that you're seeing from those new accounts that are 3 years or less on book. And as the legacy portfolio has really stabilized and isn't seeing further improvements in credit losses, that's what's really driving the impacts of provisioning. You no longer have that muting effect. So I would echo our earlier comments. I would say the credit environment continues to feel very benign. We feel good about the environment and the originations we're doing in the environment today. And I would expect provisions into the foreseeable future really to continue to be driven more by the seasoning of loan growth and not by any sense of deterioration in the book."

Looking at PULSE, it's been kind of a tough sector for quite a while for some obvious reasons. I guess, some have kind of suggested that there may be some needs for a consolidation in PIN debit.

I think that it has indeed been difficult not only for PULSE, but the other PIN networks given in particular some of the actions that Visa took following the Durbin Amendment. And I guess, the good news is, as I indicated in my points upfront, a lot of our volume loss in the last year or so was from one big customer, and we saw some stabilization of our PULSE volumes this quarter sequentially. And so I think -- I feel like we're hopefully through the worst of some of that challenge. But the constraints continue to be really difficult in terms of rules and how the migration to EMV cards is, what the rules are on the various issuers that the dominant players have. I think that consolidation is certainly possible. And at some point -- I mean, we and First Data have by far and away the largest of the independent PIN networks. So one could argue that one or both of us might end up being in the good position to be the consolidators. But -- and I think we have some things to offer because we do have signature debit, not just PIN debit, which is unique among all the independent PIN networks. But that being said, if at any point we decided we were not the best owner, we are focused on shareholders and doing the right thing to build shareholder value. So we'll continue to pursue lots of different options in the industry."

But really the big drivers on the NIM expansion continues to be the card yield itself as well as that higher revolve rate, which is a component piece, as you know, that really is affected by that transactor mix.

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report; and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC.

For the third quarter, we reported net income of $639 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.56, including $0.07 of onetime tax benefits. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, with EPS up 13% year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%.
Our Direct Banking business continues to perform well, accelerating the pace of total loan growth to 5% over the prior year. In the card business, we grew receivables by 4%, once again much faster than card sales, which grew by 1% over the prior year.
As I mentioned last quarter, we remain more disciplined than certain competitors in reward spend. And as a result, we have sacrificed some transactor sales volume. We are, however, taking some actions on rewards to accelerate card sales, but we are not chasing unprofitable volume. I'd remind you that loan growth, which drives most of our profits, is driven by revolver spend. Our product continues to resonate well with prime revolvers, and that has allowed us to achieve loan growth in our target range.
We are focused on delivering the best products to our customers, and we are continuously innovating, testing and implementing new features and benefits, ways to serve our customers better and more efficiently, and we offer rewards that provide real value to our cardmembers. Our cards continue to be well regarded in the marketplace, as evidenced by MONEY Magazine naming 3 of our cards, Discover it, Discover it Miles and Discover it Secured, to their annual best credit cards list last month.
I'll now move to our other Direct Banking products, which also delivered strong performance in the quarter. The organic student loan portfolio increased 14%, with strong performance during this year's peak back-to-school period. Personal loans grew 16% over the prior year, driven by product enhancements and opportunistic marketing, which took advantage of pullbacks in advertising by some marketplace lenders. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016.
On the funding side of our Direct Banking products, we increased direct-to-consumer deposits 19% over the prior year. This was driven by some of the highest retention rates we've achieved, and we accelerated growth in new customer balances. Though market rates have increased in the last year, our funding costs for direct-to-consumer deposits has remained relatively flat. 
Moving to our payments business, PULSE volumes declined 6% year-over-year and were flat quarter-over-quarter, showing some volume stabilization. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 12% driven by continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
Finally, I'd like to talk about something we're very proud of here at Discover. In August, J.D. Power announced that Discover ranked highest in credit card customer satisfaction for the third straight year. I'd like to thank each of our 15,000 employees who continue to work hard to deliver the best possible value and experience to our card members. 
Overall, it was a good quarter. We achieved record EPS, even excluding the onetime tax benefits.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he'll walk through the details of our third quarter financial results."

I'll start by going through the revenue detail on Slide 5 of the presentation.
Net interest income increased $140 million or 8% over the prior year, driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total noninterest income decreased $27 million to $476 million. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9% driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate was consistent with the second quarter and up about 13 basis points from the prior year. The increase over last year is primarily driven by higher promotional rewards, principally our Cashback Match program, which helped to drive strong new account growth this quarter. We expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement in our target segments. And as a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in around 119 basis points for the full year 2016.
Moving to Payment Services. Revenue was flat year-over-year, as lower volumes at PULSE were offset primarily by lower incentives. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 5% for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.82% was 45 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase.
On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $5 billion to make up 46% of our total funding. Our funding costs increased 10 basis points driven by higher market rates, higher FDIC assessments due to large banks surcharge and changes in funding mix as we extended the maturity profile of our broker deposits. Overall, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points from the prior year to 9.99%.
For the fourth quarter, we currently expect net interest margin to be relatively flat. We may, however, utilize some of the healthy NIM toward promotional balanced growth initiatives.
Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. I would remind you that last year's results had $23 million in expense associated with the wind down of the direct-to-mortgage origination business. The largest driver behind the $5 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation you see in the table was higher headcount to support compliance activities. Marketing expenses were up $27 million as we made opportunistic investments, primarily in card but also in student and personal loans. Professional fees fell $17 million, primarily due to the completion of look-back-related anti-money laundering remediation activities in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves $75 million, while last year, we had a much smaller build of only $8 million. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.17% increased by 13 basis points year-over-year and fell 22 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.87% increased 22 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign. Reserving was primarily driven by the compounding effects of several years of consistent loan growth.
Looking at private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate decreased 8 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, were relatively flat. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations.
Switching to personal loans. The net charge-off rate was up 64 basis points from the prior year and 25 basis point sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 18 basis points from the prior year and down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth and are consistent with our expectations.
Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio declined sequentially. The ratio decreased 40 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.5% of our common stock, including the incremental $100 million we announced in August following the Federal Reserve's nonobjection to our de minimis request.
In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM; saw increased rewards expense, primarily due to our match promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts. And while provisions were a headwind, the consumer credit backdrop remains relatively stable.
That concludes our formal remarks. Now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantelle, to open the line for Q&A."

I think it's a very model-driven process on the front end, which we apply some judgment on the back end. But that judgment is pretty rigid. In terms of how to think about and parse it up, what I would say is the biggest string that's really driving some of the increase over the course of the last couple of quarters is the fact that over the last several years, you've had the back book of legacy loans, which is 3 years or more seasoned. It's over 80% of the book. We were getting really big improvements in that legacy back book. And it was masking the impact of the growth-driven provisioning that you're seeing from those new accounts that are 3 years or less on book. And as the legacy portfolio has really stabilized and isn't seeing further improvements in credit losses, that's what's really driving the impacts of provisioning. You no longer have that muting effect. So I would echo our earlier comments. I would say the credit environment continues to feel very benign. We feel good about the environment and the originations we're doing in the environment today. And I would expect provisions into the foreseeable future really to continue to be driven more by the seasoning of loan growth and not by any sense of deterioration in the book."

I think that it has indeed been difficult not only for PULSE, but the other PIN networks given in particular some of the actions that Visa took following the Durbin Amendment. And I guess, the good news is, as I indicated in my points upfront, a lot of our volume loss in the last year or so was from one big customer, and we saw some stabilization of our PULSE volumes this quarter sequentially. And so I think -- I feel like we're hopefully through the worst of some of that challenge. But the constraints continue to be really difficult in terms of rules and how the migration to EMV cards is, what the rules are on the various issuers that the dominant players have. I think that consolidation is certainly possible. And at some point -- I mean, we and First Data have by far and away the largest of the independent PIN networks. So one could argue that one or both of us might end up being in the good position to be the consolidators. But -- and I think we have some things to offer because we do have signature debit, not just PIN debit, which is unique among all the independent PIN networks. But that being said, if at any point we decided we were not the best owner, we are focused on shareholders and doing the right thing to build shareholder value. So we'll continue to pursue lots of different options in the industry."

I would say in terms of transactor attrition, it's a modest amount of it. It has been relatively consistent in terms of that contribution. Don't really want to forecast looking forward what's going to happen with transactor volume and transactor accounts, as candidly we don't want to attrite those transactors forever. So I think there'll be some element of that. But really the big drivers on the NIM expansion continues to be the card yield itself as well as that higher revolve rate, which is a component piece, as you know, that really is affected by that transactor mix. But I would also say it's been very effective management on the part of the treasury team and the deposits business on our funding costs, which has been really a huge contributor to the 37 basis point year-over-year increase in NIM that you see reported."

There's been some discussion -- and I apologize if you actually addressed this earlier. I joined the call late. But there's been some discussion of the 2015 vintage in the credit card space not being nearly as strong as prior vintages for whatever reason. Are you seeing that in your portfolio as well? And is it just sort of natural as we get further and further away from recession? Or is it increasing risk appetite? Any thoughts there would be helpful."

So you now have vintage data for some of those newer originations that are there. And I would say the 2015 year for us thus far looks pretty solid. The one thing I would caution you on in looking at those vintage curves, though, that I pointed out there is in adding new accounts to the trust, you don't add any charged-off accounts. So the numbers you're going to see there for those new accounts are going to be somewhat elevated because until we actually start taking charge-offs on those, you really -- or getting recoveries on those rather, you're really looking at gross charge-off numbers."
